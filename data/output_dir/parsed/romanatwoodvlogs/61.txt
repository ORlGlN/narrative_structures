I love this outfit she is zoned into

truly a madhouse today the house is
being packed up and reorganized for
reorganized for next Christmas the tree

together it's starting to look like it's
not Christmas anymore so it looks like
our house again so uh hey what up would
you get me right oh man sauerkraut yes
sir
you don't mess you know I was just about
to start the oven you know but now I
don't I'm about to show you cuz we all
gonna like it I'll show you
I need a cooking tray well this bit this
is huge that fit in the oven
what does fit in the oven but will it
fit yeah I need this foil yeah okay do
you know what I'm cooking baby hi baby
what's up dude what's up pretty eyes all
right preheat bake I think 350 you'll be
good think Oh so today guys is cooking
in the kitchen with Roman you guys ready
for this I've never done this before and
I'm a little nervous to be honest
how does this work is this
no I already know it's only gonna having
I already know what you get all right
I'll do it for you baby I'll do it for
you because I know this is something you
want another oh nothing says cooking
with ramen like a good apron oh my gosh
I'll wear country's apron today for the
vlog all right here's the plan for today
guys we have you remember last year I
was able to baby I forgot even had this
all I'm in the moment right now I'm
trying to explain this crazy idea last
year I was able to pull my kids on the
xmax the RC I was able to pull them all
over the snow you whoever this year I
want to pull them on ice so I got all
these giant
xmax tires but here's the problem these
wheels are huge look almost as big as my
head alright but these are sealed with
this crazy glue right like you can't get
them off you can't get them up country
can you get that off try to pop a seal
for me
I'm confused you're not really cooking i
hears if you can't peel that off the rim
I got to cook it so you want I got to
get it off that rim that's yeah so
here's my idea preheat to 350 put them
in for about 20 minutes and I bet we can
peel them off there you know I don't
know break this glue so we are going to
stack these in the oven and guys
honestly I don't know if this is worth
the shot or not I've heard that you can
do this I am back no I don't know it
well I don't think so
I I've actually heard that you can do
this I've never done it so we're gonna
try it right now let's stack them up put
them in the oven no I don't think so not
not I mean it's a cooking apron this is
what you wear to keep like fire to cook
tires yeah you don't want to get melted
rubber all over you
alright Freeney ovens preheated let's go
let's go we cooking some wheels good
it's tough to clean this house your
button tires yeah but look they're
cooking up not oh look at how it's
smoking oh I'm gonna load it yeah this
is it I don't know
I'm gonna try one I'm not wait yeah I
might Ramallah
I just took my apron off like an idiot
your birth country's manpower boy
actually no way we kind of did is it
ripping it though yeah why don't you
look up I'm sure someone's done a
YouTube video on this yeah me I'm the
one it's not you know I think they still
need about ten minutes in the oven so
the idea here and I can just run here's
the idea to get more traction on ice
these just spin you to spin and spin and
spin you don't go anywhere but if I can
get this tire off that RIM then I can
run screws up through the bottom and
have spiky hard metal screws for
ultimate traction be cool right like
spiky tires pretty it could work
you ready Caine maybe I do that maybe I
do that to speed things up maybe I just
do the screws it doesn't look as cool
but I can just run the screws like we
did with the dirtbike I can just run the
screws straight to the top and it
believe it or not it is a lot of
traction the screw tops are pretty sure
guess what chicken but what I'm pulling
these out I'm pulling all jeez jeez hot
hold these gloves oh that's not good
smoke alarms gonna go smoke alarms gonna
go up this cooking rubber and yeah we
don't burn outs in here I'd say that's
medium well hey we did it
first of all we didn't fail we just
learned how not to do it alright boys
yeah come on here your lunch is ready
hey no you don't need it you don't need
a nice day Plan B we're gonna take off
the paddle tires to ride on water you
actually are riding on water when it's
ice now so we need spikes so we're gonna
swap these guys out
we're running screws through this will
actually work pretty good let me see I
mean that'll still be a ton of traction
we're just gonna have to wait it down
big time like a lot of weight last year
I put I don't know how much maybe 20
pounds on top of this to get to be able
to pull the kids without slipping
everywhere so this part about the same
got it
okay this good job take that spot in
here drag it drag it drag it you got it
so basically what we're doing is we're
gonna run we're gonna run a screw
through each knob basically each big
knob all the way around the whole tire
and believe it or not it'll be a ton of
traction that we were able to pop
wheelies on the dirt bike the dirt bike
we ran through all the knobs and you can
pop wheelies on you got it ass it oh
that looks mean right there that is cool
oh you silly boy yes there you go boom
oh okay so we're gonna try to we're
gonna try to hide a 25 pound weight give
traction up under the frame so that
looks like just the RC truck if anything
will be cooler actually seeing a big
weight on top of the truck and the idea
here is make sure this thing will fall
off I think we can do it I think we can
do it boss
looks mean check out that tire you look
at that tire though see that Tyler Moore
point attachment I mean you can never be
too safe out there you know I'm saying
no saying you go no one knows how to tie
a rope quite like this yeah we're gonna
make sure she never falls off you see it
shake that wow that's tight
it's good now let's make sure the body
goes long I mean the bodies on the
weight are so bent out rub so hard he's
gonna down here that's just as good you
straight lowered it and it's good yeah
it is it's lowered upgraded wheels and a
fat body you know I think I'm gonna tie
the front end to all right it looks
pretty nasty
that's pretty cool you ready all right
try this let's take it out let's do it
let's do it on anything waste so much
dude
it does not care that there's 25 pounds
strapped to it it is just like it's
ready to go
you guys ready about to hit the ice we
are currently what what's so weird look
at it you can see the crack from
yesterday yeah but look how deep it is
under that crack so it's hard to see on
camera we're currently at four inches of
ice which means this sucker is solid
today did I can scrape the ice that's
awesome it's actually not as much
traction as I thought we need more
weight on it
I'm fairly any power at all
I'm gonna pull myself
it's like barely any trigger it's barely
going there you go little buddy hang on
Oh
Wow
I can't believe you can pull two of I
can
the truck is just lacking Whitner I get
to add more weight you digging even
harder but when I plug blow the tough
more like forward clogged
it's your turn if it'll do a big boy
this is important
Oh
I love it
see you guys one lap to hold me know we
need to give you a head start
no oh it's not
driving one of my favorite things now
huh there you go see ya it might be
dying
oh my gosh guys this is so fun dude it's
like so weird to pull yourself on an RC
truck around a pond on a flood watch
slick whoo see I told you what you think
imagine if you can imagine you go
sledding down hill and then it pulls you
back up the hill use them seriously you
need some breaks on that baby all right
well I was just coming to check in on
you looks like you're doing fine
oh my flash join me whoo
this is so fun now the kids have
full-size sleds on the ramp which has me
a little nervous because you can't steer
it right so if you got me nervous it's a
little shady okay so I'm just let me
walk out here I'm just gonna go ahead
and show you guys what our next step is
we're gonna take this ramp off oh yeah
we're gonna take this ramp off we're
going to put some plywood on here and
extend this all the way down to here so
that you can come down the ramp across
drop down onto the pond and go as far as
you can that's the next thing we're
gonna do with the with the ramp thing
idea cuz we just keep extending and
adding to it and I have a zoo pretty
you guys need more water you're running
out of water this is just dry wood
giving me chills giving me chills when
you go across this cake go ahead boys
mop the pool boy mop it it's solid oh
did you have a rough day flashy dude you
don't want that you don't want it you
don't want it don't he thinks actually
probably would fish food but not some
shrimp Greg you want to try your first
first human drink but but she wants that
Cup she was you spill it
morphman warping past a little time
tonight guys everybody has left we are
we're we're getting some snow it's with
snow if we get a few in oh okay look
come here dude this is just happen oh
it's looking pretty yes dude it's
something there's hope yeah hopefully I
know we're not supposed to get much
saying like three inches at the most but
that's still enough to get on a sled and
get pulled behind a four-wheeler
dirtbike this glass needs clean so bad
I'm so embarrassed here we go
okay watch okay this will show you how
dirty the glasses watch this strip that
she cleans ready Wow
so with with with reef lighting like
proper lighting to grow quote these are
all real corals every single thing in
here is real and to have that grow us
then flourish the way it does you have
to have very powerful writing but that
lighting causes a lot of algae and you
have a what's called a cleanup crew like
snails and things like that but they're
just not keeping up when you see mommy
and daddy do it you want to do it oh
yeah one of the starfish they know
they're about to get fed there we go
watch them they're gonna go crazy Kane
crazy Kane whoa you see the Cardinal I'm
gonna try to get it baby get it baby get
it baby
whoo this guy look at this guy no it's
okay it's okay he's fine
