just for this you can be how's that work
what do they have to do they can go to
smile more to your website and click the

is called and toyota.com and click the
link I think what he means is both links
will be in the description of this hit
everybody that donates
do they get do they get one ticket per
toy one ticket one entry per toy okay so
if you go to the website I'm trying to
make this really easy for you guys if
you go to their website which is in the
description
you get like a ticket per toy you send
right there's a registration form the
registration will actually be your entry
into the drawing so if we make a big
green box they click on fill out two
toys equals two tickets correctors every
single ticket is going in the massive
pile and then Brittany and I are giving
away a whole bunch of whole stuff what
five hundred dollar gift card a couple
hundred dollar gift cards and Apple

keep adding to that list so everybody
that donates through their website is
gonna get that ticket you can still
donate a toy these have to be new toys

can be at any size it can be just a
little toy can be a big toy and if you
don't want to if you don't want to go
through their website you can just send
