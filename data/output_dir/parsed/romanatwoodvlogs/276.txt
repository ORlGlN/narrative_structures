got all the way out here which is pretty
far can I have my hat on so I might be
losing my hat
whoa yeah why I'm pretty friggin
exhausted right now man that was a
serious - bro gallery talk I feel great
this morning before I had my camera I
was really killing man like I mean the
waves are small so they're easy but I
was doing so good I'm so excited in the
second time we went out after we ate I
was just fail after fail after fail I
just couldn't get it so fond dude
seriously I feel like if I live here the
vlogs would go to crap which is super
fun till my arms that I feel like rubber
right now just getting back to those I
gotta tell you this ride just pulled the
kid a leaf lizard Oh
check him it up yes my deliverance he
does look like a lizard telling the kids
I swam with my hat the hole I surfed
with my hat all it was like commitment
and it would fall off I would find it
and fall off I'd find it and I'm like
you know what I'm not meant to leave
this house I'm meant to have this hat I
sit on top of the van right when we're
leaving I put the towel around me and we
drove off without my hat is so I just
lost my only smaller hat on this trip so
there's a small more hat somewhere along
thousand beat those rocks are vicious
with it I just barely clipped it moving
and it literally just shaved my skin and
then look at this
just barely touched it I mean just
barely shy coughs on there's where your
surfboard got me how'd you catch her let

Brett actually when Cain was in her
belly she got the same issues get
basically like Sun poisoning from being
that maybe she gets Sun poisoning when
she's pregnant it like blotches up on
the show but she's not even been in the
Sun it's like blotchy yeah ah to make
sure she'll have to be very very very
careful and you haven't even didn't out
that much yeah I mean you do look like a
strawberry strawberry shortcake time to
do some painting last night a girl was
waiting by the pool for us she brought
up the ukulele and a bunch of painting
stuff like paint supplies in a cool
little canvas yeah yeah paint well boy
keep it in line keep it in the line boy
get work painting
Cain you know what I've learned about
Hawaii it's beautiful
I personally would find it very
difficult to be unhappy in Hawaii now I
know if you live here there's probably
millions of reasons you could be unhappy
maybe you know it's expensive to live
here so financially it could be
difficult but spiritually as just
motivating and inspiring this land
brings meat up it lifts me up that look
at that this to me it is true paradise
this is paradise as good as it gets in
my opinion ok so this is bringing back
some serious memory when Dale and I were
kids we would just basically wait for
the wave to break on top of us and we
did this every single year on vacation
watch these kids it's this hot here they
come guys here they come here comes your
set you got to get in it get in it
oh sure they just tackle that sore
walking were walking down to the other
side of the beach where the waves are
breaking and apparently his name is f1
but he's back today check him out she
it's a she and she is alive Oh what's up
man oh how cool is that
that's Hawaii man I thought I heard him
say smile he did but he's gonna add that
audio my camera got laid your face wet
sock toast would be 20-foot waves at a
place called
you can't think of it Honolua Bay
Honolua Bay tomorrow that's like the
cliff that we went on the first day
second day and I flew the drone over
this would be 20-foot waves man I do not
want to miss out on that I'm not got to
surf with the watch we found one brave
surfer headed out after all that
oh man all right so there's only one guy
in the ocean right now one guy down here
and he's made it all the way out we got
to catch this guy catching away man
he's committed like it's hard to get out
and I know he's up he's up he got a
little warm up Oh get it dude looks like
he's headed home boys for the record the
guy took a beating and he lasted way
longer than any of us - Dale what kind
of bird is that I think that's a man
attacked oh man taxi
whoa look at that I want to do that let
your hand truck all right guys tonight's
sunset is way prettier especially since
I'm with you especially kind of cold in
the strength out in a spring one yes

painting you finish the painting look at
that started white now it isn't all
finished - one more 2017 the dinner time
is rolling then it's time is role in
looked at Dellen I felt a little better
about my redness I was like oh my god I
can never dealt with this camera now I
look who did I tell you about my hat
earlier I lost my hat this hat that I
truly believed I wasn't meant to lose
because about surfing in it I lose it I
grabbed it painted I'd find it I put it
back on I put it on top of my car and
then we drove away
I lost mine but this is the crazy part
earlier this week a couple guys came to
the hotel to meet us and they offered us
a fishing boat we want to go fishing so
Carl got their number and today he got
this text from the fisherman so is named
Harold local Hawaii and my brother but
is it yo Carl is Harold local boy from
Maui I don't know if it's a convenience
or just perfect time Winston oh look at
coincidence or just perfect timing but I
don't know if Roman lost his hat today I
was driving on the highway in scoffs
model more hat so I went down to go get
it I would be more than happy to give it
back to him are you all busy tomorrow
not 100% sure if it is his though we're
crazy I said dude he did lose his hat
you don't know how happy we left it on
top of the car he was bummed that this
is weird dude okay first of all there's
only one road that goes around the
silence so it's so much a traffic so
many cars of all people the spot of that
hat was the guy that Carl got his number
two beginning in this trip and found my
smaller hat is that crazy it would be a
quorum
yeah that's like your lucky hat now
and I know I was like I should just give
him that yeah but then Carl was like
dude you should keep that all day I was
like I'm not forced to leave this guy it
was really weird
and then the fact that I said I finally
lost the hatton and as the one personal
now and that knows it finds the Hat on
the highway and you Matt you get your
hat from us in the whole white truck
