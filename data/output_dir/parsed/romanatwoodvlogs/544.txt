Kate are you serious clean him up I was
gonna do the whole counter dude all
right let me know when you guys got that
stuff cleaned up guys welcome to the
vlog good morning good afternoon good
night whatever time it is I hope you're
having a great day we are it ma'am over
here it's just mayhem if you watch
yesterday's vlog you know I told you I
had one goal today and that was to hook
a bunch of meat up to this drone and
give Zusi a treat I'd say overall he's
pretty excited about it
you ready Zeus are you ready boy oh my
gosh how do we gonna do this yeah how
are we gonna hook a hot dog onto the
drone so that it just comes right off
we actually had some great suggestions
made by you guys a lot of guys sit
fishing string tell Lego piece so that
the Lego detaches really easily so the
hotdog
I'm thinking more like nothing can
attach but the hotdog so he doesn't so
he doesn't eat anything else I mean
little fart you little monster we're
gonna have a bigger problem I don't
think we have hotdogs
we seriously don't have hotdogs dude hey
hey serious question can you get hot
dogs now hot I need hot dogs for Zeus I
know he doesn't need hot dogs but he
wants hot dogs my dog gets what he wants
Brittany just had to go out and take
Flash to his first um I like checkup
basically puppy has to go in for the
first time you check out make sure he's
healthy strong ready to rock and roll
with this big dog no jump oh you missed
sure
can't came buddy what's going on today
do we need to talk to do we need to talk
this out why you
that's for your macaroni dude well if
you know why you why are you feeling it
Legos with cheese now what are you gonna
put in your little macaroni oh yeah
Kane just so you know most of the
cheeses on the counter oh my god so till
Brenda gets back I'm just uh you know
I'm doing dad things here this is this
is the the dad stuff I guess come lick
the cheese off this counter oh whoa
scared me ah totally forgot will you
didn't get the hot dogs
what still I didn't do anything kids did
it no okay I needed one little Noah did
this cheese messed up
well I'm last night so I'm not touching
it so how's the mac and cheese hey you
know what you know what might work
better
Bologna cuz I can just put it on
something to just tear off you know I
mean like a round chunk of Bologna
they don't just tear off there's no risk
okay yeah let's do it get blown e he's
really hired can we flash hey how does
little appointment go what they say
everything's good
healthy dog we don't take him back so
let me know what its food culture says
oh she had to see her the swamp oh why
don't they do that no I had to take the
poop uh we had all of my hair
hmm oh that looks like one comfy bed
right now
alright guys straight up I had to call
over the expert had to bring over my
brother to help me out on this project
you know this is above my pay grade
we got the Bologna we got the hot dogs
we got the Zeus they would have been
doing it so here's my thoughts before
you jump in on the conversation
lightly tape this to the drone so that
if Zeus snagged rope it just comes off
right then there's no drum problems
there's no drying problems and then we
just simply put the Rope through the tip
of the Bologna so if he grabs the
Bologna it just comes off I'm gonna say
for first try that's a flawless play on
a flawless now it is it like record
winds outside today we haven't had wind
like this in a long time so I'm worried
you've flown these in the wind I have
flown them and the way actually they've
flown itself in the way they do pretty
good it does the job for you that broom
looks like it's seen better days when
you think you want a piece kostik look
he just smells right through the plastic
all right it looks like you got
everything in a wrap we'll see you later
you're leaving you can't go I'll be back
ok here's my theory I'm using the
lightest rope I can find and this is
just gonna very lightly hold the string
onto the drum basically if it gets any
type of pole it's gonna come out oh man
this is gonna be a sloppy one Zeus maybe
this isn't gonna hold it up might just
rip it I'm gonna put the Rope through
wow it's really sensitive
Bologna's too fragile yeah just tears
right up I'm gonna try hot dog yeah all
right let's try the hot dog I'm gonna
basically just make a hole up towards
the top with my meat thermometer this is
perfect yeah
right now oh it's so windy agree yeah
it's so windy alright guys we get ready
to set up for the first ever drone verse
dog hot dog eating competition just got
to get a cable for this and I guess it's
ready most you guys know these things
basically find himself so I don't have
to do anything and I'll actually take
off by itself I'm just gonna raise it up
a little bit turn my dog loose and let
him have it
hopefully I captured on film
haha hey the rope work he'd attach the
rope that's good
did you like did you like the hot dog
alright now that he's tasted to me he's
got a taste for the meat we're gonna
lengthen the rope make that rope longer
try again clap hey I want more action
I'm embarrassed but the Rope worked it's
attached no problem the drone didn't
even move
nice alright I was terribly lame I'm
gonna lengthen the rope make it really
long and see if I can't get the hotdogs
eaten alright here we go
Zeus is ready oh are you Anna wait to
hold back a hotdog failed and he doesn't
want it I honestly because the little
drones we always have he just demolished
him like he eats him he just knows he's
gonna get the hotdogs with no work
that's what it is
he's full to things I think Zeus has
become comfortable with the drone I
think it's gonna work this time other
thing is the wind is getting incredible
outside so I'm a little nervous about
that because I don't I'm not good with
this I'm not a pro I don't know what I'm
doing see look at the camera
it's insane no matter how you move it
stay straight
yeah today stay
hot dogs on dress-up dude he wants the
drone he doesn't want the hot dog he
wants to murder the drone my brother's
back just in time to explain my failure
it was a fail I did that I think dude
you guys know Zeus is obsessed with RCS
I thought he was just gonna attack but
he didn't maybe he was the meat you
chose like bad me Oh baloney
no no I used hot dogs the Bologna just
ripped they're all hundreds of people
was it a superhero Don ha ha we're gonna
fire up this grill make some good food
hang out visit kids are running around
playing games you got to just walk away
Dale you got to just walk away it'll
suck your life away
got the girls making some mean food I'm
about to grill out Britney got me all
these new spices but I don't know which
one to use these are like beef chicken
burger I got steaks and chicken I think
this is for citrus pepper probably
