be nice for our closet anyway anyways we
came out tonight to try to find some
chairs and furniture for the back patio
which is gonna be hard to find what is
it just a globe orange it's orange globe
so it turns out good outdoor furniture
is really not something you can just
walk in a store and buy it's like you
got to order this stuff and apparently
it's already out of season you have to
you have to get this stuff like right
when it starts getting warm out cuz here
in Ohio everyone's like whoa we've
already sold ours
I've pretty much given up on looking on
furniture now we're just looking at
ridiculous toys for have these poles

kids
we're walking all over this store trying
to find them the Walmart already has all
these firecrackers look at this smoke
