what's up my friend
it is officially our last day in Hawaii
isn't it I thought yesterday was and I
can't tell you well technically
yesterday was our flat full day today we
actually fly out of Hawaii but we're
here until like 11:30 p.m. yeah I think
it's like 11:45 so it's almost an entire
day here but here's what's happened we
came here with very little things so we
have to go to the store buy a new
suitcase we're trying to find us a cheap
suitcase because we have so much crafts
to take home it's like we've lived here
for six months here's another problem we
didn't think about is we drove my three
fifties my little Nissan car to the
airport and left it there so it holds
nothing and we have multiple suitcases
so I don't know how we're getting home
from the airport that is cool I like
that this is gonna have to be a small
suitcase I don't know what to do let's
tinker doll
how about one of these trunks we're
looking for a little take-homes little
gadgets for the kids and we've been
collecting stuff over the week but they
have so much stuff here oh one of these
that's a pen oh yeah comes out oh my
gosh Oh should we get a dashboard hula
for our new truck
howdy cool or if you don't like that
they got dashboard Obama's I'm gonna
really miss this beautiful sunshine palm
trees ah bright they've served us well
but we got to take them back our snorkel
our snorkel stuffs got to go back hi man
thanks again all right this will be the
last time we see this for a long time
bah boom I'm really gonna miss Hawaii
but I've never been so excited to go
home and see the kids it's just maybe
too long of a trip for me I thought the
kids next trip is definitely with the
kids and we're already planning it but I
got to stop for a second thank you guys
so much for all the love on the new
prank you guys destroyed it I was so
tired editing these last night and then
today I just realized how worth it was
the step all night in edit and get up in
Hawaii that the time change is so
different that I had to get up super
early so that it would upload on the
East Coast at a certain time and within
8 hours we're already at 1.1 million
views that's like a record I mean I
can't think of many videos I've ever
made to have that many of you so thank
you guys
you're freaking awesome I know it's
because of you I mean the videos good
too but it's definitely because of you
guys and what a perfect time to be going
home you know last time we left the
rubra we had a viral video with your
little killer prank and then now we're
leaving away with a killer video so
maybe there's something there too that
enough babbling we got a lot to pack
leave this room looks like we've been
here for a six months
every single part of this place and we
got to stuff it into two little
suitcases cuz my car doesn't hold
anymore so instead of packing like
responsible adults let me take advantage
of one last sunset on this friggin
beautiful island yeah but just think
about what its gonna feel like when
little canners runs up and grabs you
you're gonna melt I am you're gonna melt
like the Wicked Witch
whoo feels good so we got to be out of
here by 8:00 we're definitely cutting it
close because we haven't even started
packing yeah it's easy to pack leaving
because you just throw it all every time
I turn the camera the Sun is more sets
it's going down really fast
and that's it that's the last Hawaiian
Sun we're gonna see for a long time
that's it it's gone he's gone
alright guys we've kind of skip the
boring parts of packing but we are
managing to get everything in this thing
is going to explode but there's a human
body in there I guarantee we're huh you
gonna take that back I guess still not
right now you gotta water it bye bye bye
bye we're leaving so much trash okay
get me to the airport do you want my
phone we're out of here guys that's it
going to the airport we're leaving
tired of the weather Sun and the turtles
and the whales and the beautiful
temperatures tired of it

good car got us through some quite the
spots

doors on this Airport it's just open so
