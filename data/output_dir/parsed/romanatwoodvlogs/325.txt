himself I love it dude I say your truck
oh no not a screwdriver no no no I'm
gonna happen do another monster truck I
might help you ready ready
Lego oh my gosh this is going to get it
hey buddy
Noah's back here shooting bow and arrows

I told you guys it was nice out we were
going to do this and it is is beautiful
clean this guy up it's filthy hope you
guys have an excellent day look blast

best friends man as all they do is hang
out flash won't leave he will not leave
aside I never seen anything like this
like Zeus is like it's a donkey it's
here but flashes what just won't come in
he won't come inside but you got what
you got
oh close was that is that for me would
you do oh he dragged out every single
dog toy see yesterday I said it was
going to be nice that we were going to
try to build an RC track that Batman so
basically what I'm gonna do we're gonna
get cat a killer out we're going to
start flattening 'some grass kappa
killer as his name now we're going to
start flattening ground and then
Brittany and her mom went out to get all
the supplies like the drainage pipe that
usually outline your track with and some
type of steak
to get the pipe to stay on the ground it
should be fun it should be an experiment
to see you drifting the Queen to awesome
lower seas it sounds so fun to do with
the kids so let's go build a track all
right let's do this we're going to climb
up into the cat a killer
you take it take it out there look at
this I have a flat bucket - for the
scoop but I think I'm just going to
leave this on for now so having got a
co-pilot on this mission me and Kane you
ready
pain bail on me three quick he is over
there playing with Noah right there it's
been a dream of mine seduction to build
an RC truck probably a lot like you to
build a track of some sort sounds fun
and hey no I wasn't calling for you get
the heck out of here just others tell me
check out here so right now all I'm
doing is kind of digging out and
flattening this whole area and then
we're going to try to design it shape it
I'll probably take that jump out right
there well pipe it all animal start just
kind of hand building little humps and
bumps and jumps and whatever else the
kids want to put in the track maybe a
little mud pit I don't know I don't know
some I've always wanted to do we wanted
to do like a dirt bike four-wheeler
tracks is your seat to play on but then
I thought let's build an own little RC
truck dedicated Darcys by far the
greatest grown-up toy you can ever have
I mean look at that look at that
there is no doubt in my mind that the
kids and I and family and visitors are
going to have fun on this some try to
shape it I never built a track but I
guess you could shape it however you
want you could have the turns wherever
you want and I'm kind of creating almost
an oval shape and then it's going to
come around and in and back around and
back out and then a full circle
you
all right let's go get all the pipe did
this is gonna be sweet
whoa cane she got tons of a good job I
hope it's enough
oh I hope to state things that we got
work because they didn't have like this
is supposed to go underground this is
going to be a great start from what I've
seen online and when I used to go to RC
tracks this is what they use for the
boarders and it's kind of what outlines
the track and keeps your car from going
off that Lane okay what the hooter
writer dude I did not even see y'all
good job okay since I've never done this
before have no idea what to expect with
this piping and how you mount it to the
ground but for now I'm going to go ahead
and kind of lay it out and get an idea
what it's going to look like and then
we'll figure out how to how to stick it
in this is gonna be so fun but you know
the kids are going to have a blast like
this so we're just kind of like building
it right now and trying to get it even
and then I'm guess I'm going to try to
somehow stake it all in and okay guys
some time has passed I got it all pretty
much done what you think is it fun
here's the only maintenance you guys I'm
pretty proud of this this is cool for me
to build especially get use out of that
guy so the only issue right now is we
don't have the proper stakes to mount
the tubing so it's kind of loose and it
moves around if you hit it so we got to
get stakes and we got to figure out
where we want to put our jumps and our
berms and our ramps and you want up here
give me your hand
so we're kind of taking it easy trying
not to move the tubing too much I guess
I got to order the stakes which kind of
stinks is we want to go hard on this
right now I didn't jump satin Hill maybe
even extending it if it gets too small
it's not that huge I've already I've
already noticed that maybe I didn't make
it big enough but it's a nice starter
track for us
we're not professionals okay oh boy let
yukine whoa try again
Oh maybe next time clunk whoa oh my god
that's fun huh
you made me feel really fast all right
honey we are told I know it's dinner
time but listen we're gonna save so much
money on our next flight because look we
can fit at least one kid in the suitcase
all right yeah that's my saving right
there can you saving me money boys we
are we're finally coming inside in dark
out what yeah I feel good today like we
had a lot of fun and we actually got an
entire start to an hour see tracks done
you see you saw the next step is going
to be getting like five six of the same
exact trucks blank bodies and letting
everybody paint their own truck so it's
like their truck then as even when
guests come over we have like a line of
trucks everyone just grab one we can
race i'ma push to the dinner table for
mommy

grown up with them I've just always
really loved them I have a couple really
cool one of a cup would you laughing me
what are you doing what are you doing a
little rascal king should daddy give
this truck away or but somebody would
really love it when you love to see the
smile on somebody's face I have a couple
of these they are like I guess they're
not one-of-a-kind because I have more
than one but I only have one blue one
and it's beautiful and I'm thinking
about giving it away to one of you guys
it's brand-new it's never been driven
it's got everything the remote
everything is I mean look brand-new
it's still got all the tags got the
battery not really ready to part ways
with it because I kind of want to hang
it on my wall but I'm sure I could
probably get another one sent to me if I
really like yellow are we being on the
way evening in a long way no I have a
yellow one but I love the blue maybe I
give the yellow
no we had three we had to be at four
come on give me one and I gave it away
yeah
who got that who needs to send me a
picture that that being said guys would
you guys I haven't done giveaways
forever I just had a long con should I
give a small more truck away we've been
doing a lot of RC stuff and it would be
really cool to see one of you just so
happy to receive this and play with it
and have fun maybe with your parents or
maybe a parent with their kids so yeah
tell me should I give this guy away or
should I keep it should I just hang it
on my wall things like don't you give it
away but K we got so many our C's he's
emotionally and he's attached just like
I am sometimes it's about giving I can
get the yellow one away okay all right
