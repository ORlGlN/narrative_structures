you slept so much so much pain you're
doing that side to side that's how I
know things being serious I just want to
stop moving it is hot hot hot outside

you a double temperature like 2,000
degrees so like a bad contraction I know
I don't know
my bladder oh my gosh are you gonna be
your pan this is this is what it's like
guys literally this is why the vod's are
where they're at right now because it's
this constant it's just stuff in
constant questioning it is it it it just
not is this it but Carter mean I like go
out and do something right now like I
want to but like how do I leave your

like ask them if they still want like

always false alarm let's we've we've all
gotten discouraged because it's
constantly fall for us I know full week
yeah crazy so I'm gonna leave you guys
right there it is current day just so
you know this is exactly where we're at
right now with a baby with Britt with
our lives and you can see how difficult
it might be for me to just go do
something cool for the vlogs or do
something today I really tried to focus
on at home cane real personal camera
just sitting filming what we're doing
like real life stuff so that's where
we're at I can't thank you enough for
being here hoping praying maybe we get
enough out there so have this baby today
man I don't know what to say like that's
exactly where we're at like that's where
you see it I love you guys so much my
goal is keep the vlogs coming the streak
is longer than it's been since my 500 in
some day streak that's the last time
I've done this good and but at the end
of the day if Britt needs me side by
side and then that's all I'm going to do
and I'm just probably not going to film
it but until then we're going to keep
rolling and trying to at least upload
something for you guys
thank you for being here I love you so
much we love you as a family you're
beautiful
