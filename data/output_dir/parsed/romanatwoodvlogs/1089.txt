what's up guys good morning I have only
one goal today one goal I want to bring
you along and that is to prank
Britney hard I got the boys with me
today Britney as some of you probably
know is helping her sister set up for a
baby shower which is tomorrow so we have
the whole house to ourselves
I've spent most of the day cleaning
making sure that it's camera friendly so
that it looks good because as you guys
know Thanksgiving it got destroyed the
house was destroyed so uh the house
looks good for camera right now let me
show you what I got
they just you you want me to show him
what we got yeah okay
I had this shipped in to my brothers
so that Britney would never see it he
delivered it to me it's a replica dummy
of Kane that's right we're gonna be
playing upstairs Kane is going to be
wearing this spider-man outfit which
covers the entire body then I'm gonna
have the dummy in the exact outfit which
I will accidentally toss throw fall off
of that balcony down to here are you
ready to get mommy yeah are we gonna get
her good
that's right yeah uh you can bend him up
you can bend them hard we want him I was
just part was floppier but just through
like when something instantly happens
you don't have time to think
wait his arms and legs weren't that
floppy you don't think about that stuff
that's what I learned
making our prank movie you can put
things right in front of people when
anything really happens it doesn't it
doesn't matter so I'm hoping that this
works just right we'll see here will you
hold this yeah vlog me oh stand back a
little bit
thanks buddy I'm trying to never dress
the little man ahem card no I get me oh
it's you wha
never dress came before like this yeah
oh this is gonna be awesome
wha oh it's awesome all right we're
gonna have to put gloves on and probably
some type of pants shoes but that looks
really good dude mommy's gonna flip let
me see yeah it looks good
yeah it looks this might be a little
that's perfect
it's great meat spider one spider two
definitely need some gloves and pants
this is gonna be the greatest day ever
that's pretty awesome
oh my gosh she's like I know what
happened all right camera time I gotta
put cameras all over this place
times start breaking out the goodie bag
yeah this guy not easy to hide by the
way this guy the original not as hard to
hide still hard to hide what's wireless
mics oh my god that's a must-have
because I can hide them around the house
or just wear
and these are my easiest cameras to hide
of course Co pros one is still charging
but I can start finding placements for
those first thing I usually do is place
the camera and see what it looks like um
in the room so this way I can see the
balcony and the floor and then I worry
about hiding actually putting something
around it luckily GoPros are so small
that you just put like anything in front
of it or even tuck it up in this under
this and just make sure all the lights
are off always make sure all the
blinking lights are off so this gets
pretty much the entire area I'm just
worried about having that close up when
she comes down you can always set uhm
you can always set it to narrow but
that's probably not gonna get the
balcony nope no balcony yeah that's a
good shot of this downstairs but then
you lose your balcony
let's call mommy and see where she is
Hey hey what's up awesome so um I just
been cleaning and stuff how much longer
you got
an hour all right cool cool yep
we're just chillin I just wonder what
time it started getting dark out all
right well I got this house pretty clean
so we'll be able to relax hang out with
the kids all right love you bye
we got about an hour 40 minutes to be
safe we got to rehearse oh my gosh
stuff to clean we still have to clean
this whole upstairs it looks like a bomb
went off in here trying to find a good
hiding spot for my bigger camera my plan
is to drop Kane off the second time
Britney comes up the steps so when she's
right about there I'm hoping that he
falls so I need a close-up I have a
GoPro over there but I need a close-up
come here Kane I'm thinking I can put
this inside want to hear what yeah you
can't even see inside that box at all
it's just reflective that'll be good
she'll never know do you have to clean
we got a lot of cleaning to do we got
much time to do it you bring in your
double up your stunt double way upstairs
here I'll get it we're about to roll on
this uh we better get dressed
I'm going to try something I've never
tried I'm actually put a wireless mic on
Kane stunt double because I imagine
Britney's gonna be the first one down
here to grab Kane so we're definitely
gonna need audio we'll see what happens
Barry get dressed why I'm up like the
FBI CIA an inside job
hopefully I don't have to change
frequency this mic
all right guys Brittany's gonna really
love us after this here we go see you
guys in a minute
no matter you're shaking I look at that
I'm like trembling like you thought cane
flew off the balcony I just he wasn't
moving but I like I think the funniest
part his arm was standing straight up
and he didn't even notice that I just
know he wasn't moving I wouldn't pay
attention to that stuff either
oh we got her guys pretty good
your nose mad you're not as mad as I
thought you'd be I thought you would be
like screaming at me kicking me punching
me start dumping all the cameras and see
what we got
I was you never know what you're gonna
get within one takers that's it whenever
well you're still mad right you're not
quit faking
I mean to be mad until I well I took it
easy on you so are you gonna help me
bring daddy
say no yeah he's on my team oh yeah say
not me oh oh you are you're gonna be a
traitor traitor we are um digging into
some leftover Thanksgiving veggies
veggies vegetables well at least the
house is all clean something good about
making a prank inside the house we clean
it still no no whore hey hey this guy's
pretty cool huh yeah I was so lucky to
find this guy yeah
fight him yeah I found him online and
shipped into Dale's house so you
wouldn't see him all right guys so as
always now it's up to me to chill right
here and start editing all night until
it's done and it I had seven seven
cameras yeah I think by now you guys
know how I feel about multicam filming I
hate it I use seven cameras for this
seven or eight cameras seven seven are
you seven and did to put that on the
computer and pick every single camera
angle that you want from each one is is
it's different I'm not used to that I
like to I like to being out on the
streets where you have just one or two
cameras all right guys so all I do now
is edit edit edit please go show your
level on this video I got Britney so
good it's a little messed up but it's
fun and we're all happy and everyone's
safe so there was no harm done
