what's up friends it is early and it's
time to fill the living room the new
couch is here oh that guy just almost
fell there here
put like over here poor guys come
deliver this couch of course it's
running up
it hasn't really rain much but the one
day they're here it is raining so help
them out a little bit that's a lot of
cushions that's just the example that's
an example of what the kids are going to
be doing so just bring in these pieces
and I can't believe in it plan my prank
or anything on this how to be funny
actually this is one big freaking couch
right let's definitely fill out this
room alright she's all in we just kind
of got to decide where we want it it's
kind of weird being halfway into the
wood just so but I mean it's like the
same size as our last couch it's exactly
about the same this is what you're gonna
do every day we ended up getting the one
that I complained about where you can
write on it it's gonna be like I don't
that's weird it's weird like that kind
of drives me nuts like I have to wipe it
you like the new couch it's big huh
just sleep good or missed you about time
you woke up like a paren kitty last
night
hey what's going on listen to my
bluetooth this is what it's done what
are you doing I don't know as much as
I'd love to be inside doing nothing
today on this rainy day I can't I can't
stop we leave for our trip in two days
and I gotta keep these orders rolling
out just keeping busy man keep busy
that's one way to stay happy keep your
mind busy oh hi oh you're killing me
look at this first thing I got to tell
you guys is thank you to all of you that
are supporting my family and myself hey
dude we have been overwhelmed by your
appreciation and your support to the
smile Moore store I mean this is this is
today's orders and yesterday this is
yesterday's orders going out today look
at this one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen frickin boxes of orders guys
like I think most youtubers would be
scared to show their viewers this this
is unbelievable this is this is
impossible to us so thank you from the
bottom of our hearts Kane's little heart
his little butt
we just truly appreciate you guys we
really do it's amazing to see something
we stand for and something we live by
being taken so well bye bye you guys you
gonna help me load the truck dude I got
a lot to load mm-hmm gonna help me yeah
all right let's do it
we got to put all the lids on because
it's raining outside really good thing I
got all the buckets with the lids on it
today it's rainy I had to put these up
front not a big deal um when I tell you
guys that most youtubers probably
wouldn't show this type of stuff what I
mean by that is it's not always good to
show your viewers any type of success in
fact if you're doing YouTube only as a
business it's actually better to make
your viewers fault and feel sorry for
you and have sympathy for you that's how
you build a more loyal fan basis is
making them making you the viewers feel
sorry for me like that that's that's a
tactic and a lot of people do it not
everyone does ative energies and that
also gets me hate though because some
people don't want to be told to be happy
they don't want to be told to be
positive nobody likes to be told to do
anything I mean it's it's like naturally
built into us we don't want to be told
what to do so I get hate for that but a
lot of youtubers hide their success and
they hide their that you know I'm proud
of this I worked hard for this I'm so
proud of it that I want you guys to know
and I want you to use it to do it
yourself and that's I guess that's what
I'm saying I just want to show you guys
that I'm happy about all this and I'm
not hiding it from ever had anything
from
I also think you guys are
single-handedly keeping the electric on
in this building bubbly so herders every
time I come in they're like we need this
so bad so it's a win-win for everybody
all right here's one going for two today
all right we got two today that always
makes me happy so yeah they keep you
busy sure do you know my all my viewers
love you so much oh she's she's the
reason he's actually go out because
she's got to go through every single one
of these right yeah well it takes a
while yeah it does but you guys are good
I think I am so I love you we love
everything you guys are doing so we can
send you packages yeah okay somebody
suggested I saw in the comments that we
should get we should get her flowers at
the post office I think next time I go
in we should surprise there were some
flowers she loved that I don't think she
watches these vlogs that's not gonna
ruin the surprise all right so just go
back home I'm trying to get GTA fun I
don't know why I did this last night but
I guess it didn't finish it's so close
try to get it already so that tonight I
can actually we're gonna try to do a
livestream I think and the couch is
already stuck in people's lives away you

I'm back home I'm in trying to get the
elgato hooked up to the ps4 so I can
record some GTA game playing live
streams and I and I'm struggling so bad
I'm even watching how-to videos on
YouTube and my head's about to explode
because every time I try to do this
gaming stuff I fail at it and I want
this to work
everybody's waiting on me there's a
whole room of people but it just goes
black as soon as I hook it up so oh just
so ridiculous what I'm trying to do to
get this to work y'all want to cry right
now
this is soda
I'll call every day I give so much
credit to every gamer in the world
because they make it look so easy this
is some of the worst gameplay you'll
ever see
I have Skype on here filming the screen
so that it looks like this I'm
embarrassed and none of its seeming to
go in the vlog it's live it's not
recording anything and I couldn't get
the elgato to work total fail pretty
upset about it
how do you plan replay oh man Wow i
straight-up failed tonight on the game
this isn't the first time I failed at
this it seems to be like kind of a
pattern it's just not good at it a lot
of people just told me tonight that I
should get a professional to come help
me set up the gameplay it would be so
fun if I could just get it right but man
it's tough it's tough it's tough out
there
gamers man I give you credit I've
destroyed the place trying to get this
to work on a super duper super duper
positive note I just realized that the
vlog channel this channel right here is
20,000 subscribers away from 2 million

attention to this at all until I started
seeing you guys as tweets in your
