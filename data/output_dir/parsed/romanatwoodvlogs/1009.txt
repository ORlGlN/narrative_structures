what's up my friends I am starting the
day a couple my friends invited me to be
a part of their YouTube show you may
know him as the fine brothers asked me
to come in and be a part of one of their
series of course I said yes and I'm
headed there now
Brittany made me this killer smoothie
the only thing is I've been picking all
the pieces out of my teeth so that I
don't show up with all this stuff my
mouth the Annabelle Hotel that looks
scary I'm not gonna lie I look pretty
freaking cool in this car biddy biddy
biddy it's cool I fit in the bike line
though I'm man what's up guys I have
some fun
Oh a blast well or maybe not maybe some
horrible horrible terrible scary things
for you usually I just get poked with
things and brought it yeah they use me
as a test subject is what we're gonna
yeah now this is my first time on on the
show so I'm excited this is fun man your
place is awesome
very quick so like yeah you have the
teens wall over here yeah be here okay
so for the react fans you basically just
move the desk yeah exactly that's great
man okay so this is what it looks like
behind the scenes all right guys I'm
about to teach you something I've
learned with age come on pass it along
to you if you have a girlfriend a mom a
grandma a fiance a wife it doesn't
matter what you have you have a female
in your life get them flowers randomly
just go they're not expensive
you find some nice flowers and take them
to them as a surprise not a holiday not
Valentine's Day not a birthday
just get them flowers for no reason it
buys you so much happiness you have no
idea the power of some flowers and
secret again is to get them as a
surprise not when they expected
you see Britney's birthday is tomorrow
so she's more likely to not be so
surprised that's why I got him today got
her some pretty flowers it'll be a nice
surprising gift hmm got you something
you like are so pretty
is mommy in her swimsuit and expect to
come home with you in your swimsuit so
now you put a cover-up on us uh teal
album
I wish my powers that I actually like
and hope that you like push down with
the boy now with dick and you miss me
today I wasn't gone long
yeah we got we gonna go to the beach for
a little bit yeah we are
I guess we're off to the beach we have
Brittany's cousin Lori with us and put
that carry pretty good let's cause huge
she's just really tiny hey this is one
of my last actual three days before real
work starts so we're gonna head to the
beach hang out show relax and at this
rate of traffic we should be there by
yeah so we passed this place all the
time for anyone to stop it's like a
ridiculous giant scene of two chairs and
a wine table it looks so funny
you go under yeah I sent something to
eat well our I like beef jerky you got
some beef jerky perfect and chips that
was quite the feat took about an hour to
actually get here and cart and just be
able to walk to the beach
we made it cane we finally made it it's
a long speech I don't know from the
vlogs
you guys know we like to come to this
Beach but if you remember look how much
has changed it doesn't even look like
the same Beach like this water that runs
through was never here and now there's
like an old dock so that was all under
sand this was never here the sand was
above the rocks it's really confusing
what is that ah littlest things
entertain you in your 3 watch Annie
ah get it off I think I'm poor
entertainment oh really nothing to see
here
not on this Beach anyway hey hey just
roll down yeah keep rolling keep rolling
come on
so yeah last time we were here this was
all Beach this wasn't here it's pretty
wild how much it changed in probably two
and a half months
cane like okay come here
did you catch one of them verbs go try
to catch one go real fast
oh you almost got him there's a seal
over here I know if you guys have ever
seen a seal I'm sure you have but in
real life it's pretty cool if I can get
him there he is there he is
he's being shy you're officially
freezing Kane look at me no you're
turning purple hang a little animal did
you have fun yeah so wet now I have to
carry your wet but sandy legs I would
imagine that 99% of parents would bring
extra clothes to the beach but Sophie
didn't we didn't bring anyone
so Britney's running into one of these
little shops to try to find a cheap pair
of shorts and shirts for eat a little
wet boy I feel incredibly out of place
