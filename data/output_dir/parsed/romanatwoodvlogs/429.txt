trick-or-treating and I'm taking my old
pod this is a funny story about this
quad I bought this quad way long ago at
least 13 years ago back when I had
- wanna take a big loan out in fact Dale
ended up buying the quad from me crazy
no and then when I finally got a little
money up he sold it back to me thank you
for that by the way I took really good
care of it you did know the quads in
great shape but it needs a little work
just you know internal stuff we're
taking it back to the place I originally
bought it from hopefully they will just
do a tune-up and clean it up make the
quad nice again maybe some new wheels
things like that so that's what we're
doing right now and then we're just
running around doing some errands get
some things that I actually want to get
done today that I would normally do
off-camera but we're vlogging every day

motorsports dealers in the entire
country I believe it's one of the
biggest so we're going to go up there

just so he's looking for like a go-kart
which is helpful to senior go car which
is actually hard to find you never see
