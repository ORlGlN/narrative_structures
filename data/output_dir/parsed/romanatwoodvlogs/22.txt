goating coding no weed goats we fed guys

livestock they have like this state of
the art like the biggest in the country
call of duty laser tag this is like real
guns with strapped with like you have to
be accurate it's supposed to be cool it
may be terrible but I think it's gonna
be cool but I have an idea after Lee we
didn't expect to actually get to film
today I thought today was gonna be more
of a travel day for these guests we're
gonna film a little bit last time Tana
was here I'm gonna show you a clip right
now what this boy did my house oh my god
I got my I got like Tony oh my god
No
and since you're back I was just
thinking he's kind of tradition right
now it's cold out and since you put a
bus in my pond I thought it'd be cool if
we can put you in the pond brother I
will say this I will say this you as of
now everybody in here except the girls
have done it so it is safe yeah Boosie
even did it what would will chainsaw a
hole out it's frozen ice and then you
just just crawl down and you the only
way it counts as if your whole head goes
under yes it'll be awesome you know it'd
also be cool don't make me edit all this
we do have a hot tub right beside it so
you can hop in ready for some modern
warfare me and you my only goal is to
protect you you don't even have to you
don't even have to do anything I won't
let anybody
okay so we're in the same place where we
did the go car races and in the back
they have they have an escape rooms and
they have this apparently crazy laser
tag so we're gonna try this this is like
a war whoa this don't look like laser
tag it's like some underground illegal
stuff right here are you just gonna be
medic medic on the field oh my you
getting rigged up you getting rigged up
let's go over teams right oh you guys oh
you guys why I'm always going to get you
all right red team Brit Roman tanner oh

wireless mic on okay my team's walking
up here Brett okay apparently when the
game starts these lights go off so you
actually are hidden and yeah yeah this
is cool we got GoPros oh you are so
smart is your GoPro rolling and we hold
down the trigger it just keeps going oh
this is real this is like this is scary
oh the lights are going on oh look at
this arena oh this is so dope okay okay
secrets so there's no like sniper points
where you can like crawl up in and they
won't
you from the other side so you can like
sniper
it chases down we don't run
Yeah right bro how did I die

you're not on my team who had the most
kills on the team it was gun but 26
kills and you need that who was that do

collect call
