you think it's possible for the soldiers
to outweigh the haters today a man that
comments in these last few blogs is just
I'm just doing my thing I do what I
always do what the comments are so
negative like nobody's talking about
things they like in the vlog they just
find one thing they don't like in the
vlog and they comment about it and off
it's just easier to hate but I really
miss all the positive stuff that it used
to be like the college used to just be
so happy and positive and I think we've
lost this so let's see if today we can
outweigh those comments maybe we're just
gonna make it worse ha ha ha dude why
