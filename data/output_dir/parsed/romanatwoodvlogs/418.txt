welcome to the vlog guys I'm going to
start this vlog with the giant thank you
to those of you that have subscribed to
this channel I always say at the end of
the vlogs and today I just feel like it
needs to be done right now thank you so
much if you are if you daily watch and
you're not subscribed hit that subscribe
but we are chasing 10 million on the
road to 10 million subscribers right now
how friggin crazy is that it's
impossible I don't believe it at all
according to the internet you guys know
we were supposed to hit it on the 20th
of this month the 15th is Britney Anais
8 year anniversary you have all been a
huge part you have all been a huge part
of trying to get us to hit 10 million by
the 15th instead of the 20th and I think
we truly have a real chance of thank you
you have been participating in that
helping us sharing and doing your thing
that all being said we have done so much
today off-camera Britney had a
chiropractor appointment and we took
Caine in for a little doctor visit the
last few days several days have been
very family based very in-home indoors
it's starting the cold out so we have
that feeling of just like being indoors
just want to do nothing inside but I
know heat things up I know how to heat
them up now am i heat them up can he not
flamethrower
so my goodness up I haven't done for a
while and that is pick up some fireworks
you guys know I love fireworks the place
is open till 8:00 so when I swing by
right now see how many Rockets I can get
come on let's go pick out some cool
stuff
I don't care you reversed whoo
I'm start wearing coats dude it's the
hoodie that's me
fireworks huh huh tanks I know they have
tanks here's there's airplanes there's
little grenades smoke bombs case you
don't know we had our own line of
fireworks this year check it out these
things are huge and shoot giant smiley
faces are these the Rockets we grabbed
out for you all right guys so had this
crazy idea how many Rockets you always
want to light like more than one or even
five or ten you have no way to do that
but I do have a way to do that so I'm
trying to figure out how many of these
how many come in a box is it like a
hundred rockets per boxer all right you
get your call of duty grenades and check
this out we got a parachute guy uh-oh
hang on we got a parachute mortar that
shoots a three and a half inch soldier
out of it and we got tanks all right we
got what we need to try this out
actually we got more than we need
okay so 144 come in a box and I got 21
boxes 3024 rockets Oh
all the way up how's that oh all right
we're just getting back over the truth
is I have no idea what I'm doing or what
I'm about to do and we sure picked a
cold day for it so I think the first
thing we got to do is figure out exactly
how we're gonna do this and how we're
gonna set it up this is you scared me
this is what a christmas rush is looking
like guys these are all completely full
of smile more orders this is just today
just from today oh these are awesome
dude look grenades
ready to do it bar no happy fun right
yeah
oh we're feeling the wrath of winter
coming man it is coming fast we go they
little but they're fun all right battle
tanks done - done with reports already
let's try it out oh oh oh he excited
yeah yeah yeah
the wind is wreaking havoc on us guys I
don't know how this is gonna kill him
everybody stand back Zeus back come on
back flash just took it he just took it
hey flash drop it drop it
flash flash drop it can't get him dude
he's too fast oh you crazy dog I think
we can count that one out I don't know
okay let's try anyone cha flash okay
here we go again
whoa Zed oh you got there you got a
little tank
all right guys so what the heck no about
mom these are little Rockets uh 144 in a
box I've got 21 boxes this is how you
normally light it right there you put
this like in a bottle or in the ground
and you just like that but like a lot of
my ideas I wanted to see how many I
could light at once
I've personally lit in stacks like this
like grouped together with a little blue
like butane torch snail go but it's not
really enough I want to go bigger than
that so do I just stick them in the dirt
one at a time 3,000 rockets maybe like a
giant sheet of star for cardboard that I
could poke them in I don't know I don't
I don't think they'll fit on that maybe
I have no idea I think this is a bad
idea
you like it you too yeah thumbs down on
that idea if we open all 21 boxes and we
stack them just like this all the way
down lean them up against the wall just
like this and then lit up the sky dude I
think we're on to it with the
flamethrower yeah yellow got your
bouquet of flowers yeah can I just open
them and I'm stack it on and 144 so 21
groups are you cool see ya
all right work invest a little bit of
time Dale my brother stopped by to help
out a lot of the time was just getting
these wrapped up into bundle look at
that when you do projects like this I'm
happy to be here I know it's like I
almost just set up the Dale the day
light it's going to have the maintenance
light but then the other for like the
fun or light glow Civ stuff yeah I'm
there I can smell the powder can help me
unload all those things here's the
serious part now keep in mind two things
one the flamethrower which we're going
to use to light all of these at once it
comes with quite the breeze right so
even if one bundle one bundle fits
really well into a Gatorade bottle if we
put weight in the Gatorade bottle boom
but I'm afraid the wind of the
flamethrower got a knock it down but I
have another idea
once you're the idea we take like one of
our white tables outside set it almost
vertical up and we line these all up the
face of it and shoot disable well then
at least they have to go that direction
after goes their interaction like this
they can go anywhere I'm no expert at
digging holes but we could also bury the
bottoms a little bit mmm dude I think
you're on to something the hole dude
this is the bottle rocket bouquet you
can't honestly there's so many of them
it looks fuzzy on camera it looks like
it looks like sheepskin or something it
does that's 3,000 ish roughly bottle
rockets dude it's amazing all that's
here well we got a few down there holy
smokes I'm excited we got to figure this
out like right now how about you I say I
say we get the planter a rigged up and
ready and then we'll just pick our
poison we they just launched them or
roll I think you got it either way you
got it the table is a great idea I like
the table it was at least it's foolproof
you know send the Rockets one way
hopefully if by chance you are brand new
to this channel this is a flame thrower
an actual flame thrower Dale's putting
diesel fuel in it right now and then you
mix it with a little bit of gasoline
gives that perfect fire effect the goal
obviously is to set these up in some
fast
to where we can shoot the flame throw it
lights all the fuses now my guess is the
fuses take a little time so the
flamethrower might actually like these
things before it even takes off I don't
know it's all trial and error here at
the atwood ass making our way out to the
shooting range we are gonna set up right
here in this light grab a couple cameras
grab the table and uh we're just gonna
do it it's good night for it it's a fire
you guys got to go in come on all right
we got the table we got a little angle
we're gonna stack them all the way
across this thing which definitely gonna
take all oh my gosh stay detsen see
looks amazing please like one fuse and
just throw oh my god
well you could just like a bottle rocket
grenade probably a good time to say this
guys please do not try this uh always
let us just do it do not try it here we
go very time-consuming just moving all
these Rockets and restocking on but it's
gonna be nuts dude go home three print a
bottle rocket comb so we can straighten
it off for the launching straight is an
issue but not something I'm worried
about and they're gonna go says the man
with the fire proof out that's right
tonight I'll be wearing a full fireman
suit so I feel pretty confident
all right guys once again warping past a
little time we've got them all stacked
up this just looks like mayhem dude this
is crazy
love it oh man I'm basically gonna stand
back where Kane is a little further back
it is super windy it is super cold and
I'm ready to get some fire gone
all right about to suit up we got a full
farming suit here which is so perfect
for tonight oh I think you missed your
calling good gonna could've been
something else no wait uh-oh we all died
ladder 49 where are you you put your leg
through the suspender I'm confused that
goes to the back no no that goes to the
back
you shouldn't say anything mail
shouldn't you know I'm so immature at
this oh yeah looking good yeah we
shooting up okay I feel pretty confident
dude you look confident - okay you look
good with that flames are on your back
you watch from this window right here
okay you can open that window up all
right we got a lot fire extinguisher we
do it's right side I'll be on standby
with the extinguisher we've changed the
angle we figured it is a little wet out
but we just didn't want to shoot into
the wood so we're gonna shoot into this
field canes in there watching from the
window and mommy
any last words okay we're gonna go tar
to wait and tired of thinking about it
we're just gonna hit it I have no idea
what to expect so here we go the mix is
really thick they're after me no fire
extinguisher Roman you got to put the
fire out we didn't cut the pin pull the
pin
have they do anything with these thick
gloves here we go they're trained
they're trained
thank you first your dude oh my gosh
it's like a war zone
ah stop it beautiful Jonathan you can
see anything dude that was amazing
really amazing I that cameras gonna be
the winner but I got hit in my pants on
my side they were going everywhere
I don't know what is burning is that the
sticks no plug where I was standing was
so intense but I couldn't see anything
when I moved it got real good back there
it wasn't as good as over here not it
was so bright look at this thing dude it
just keeps an igniting looking uh get a
shot of this this is the sticks those
are sticks yeah it looks like grass and
look how well the table did table held
up man you be able to buff out out we
did it man I didn't want to do that for
so 3,000 oh you know sweet just people
will go out what's under it
whoa look at that oh yeah all the sticks
it's like glowing red that's all so many
sticks now daggone it more my grass is
dead that's a good time we're headed in
the winter this spring it will pop back
up and never remember this happening
would be the nicest grass I ever had
right there it won't remember this
I guess such a thrill when our bad ideas
come to life and we've completed them
and they're done how's it look good I
think it's amazing well that is a good
angle Dale they'll set up a tripod up on
the porch
that was awesome as we what's next I
five thousand thirty thousand thirty a

pitched this idea to dab it and I say a
