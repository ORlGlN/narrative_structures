you're making me laugh I'm trying to do
my intro you're making me laugh hey guys
good morning good afternoon good night
not sure what time it is where you are
nice shot oh that was awesome
no I don't know how you did that
hope you're having a fantastic on who
cook that one hope you guys are having
an awesome day yesterday I tried to raw
blog it as much as possible but I kind
of started late in the day so today
we're starting at breakfast extra crispy
medium crispy I got the coffee on the
toast about to go in whoo Cain just did
an amazing trick shot I can't wait to
see it
am I looking for that's super crispy
most of you guys know that I'm the
breakfast guy Britt does the dinner
since we've met that's how it's been I
love doing breakfast ain't grill
I do the grill I do breakfast I just
don't make bacon yeah eggs on toast
I prefer chewy bacon these guys love it
crispy so I make a little bit of both
this was not accidental that two of them
were on accident oh is that how you do
it I usually use the edge right there
this pointy part the crack you go so
delicate okay not too bad boy put your
thumbs in the crack there you go
yeah you got I'll just pull it apart
don't smash it pull it boom yeah most
people every time I do this in the Poli
they're like don't you do that first
most people mix their eggs first in a
bowl an important skill I just mix it in
the skillet same thing I think they look
good
Mexico Mexican style cheese bacon toast
what you want to drink juice orange
juice
uh-huh I miss the pork this is a trick
Britney just taught me if you ever want
to melt cheese the kids like cheese on
their eggs if you ever want to melt
cheese just put one of these over top
and it melts the cheese on top I never
did it or knew about it no I always like
the cheese won't melt here you can see
the baby at would eat in his natural
habitat oh yeah oh my gosh I think half
of it yes so I Zeus warms the table like

the backyard
look what Noah caught on his camera
there's a cow chasing a chicken
he isn't so like wants to believe us but
he knows better man heading over to my
brother's right now these are some of
the things that we're gonna need I got
just about every tripod I own as far as
small cameras go
I brought some funny little lights like
a strobe light GoPro accessories and
then of course my GoPro collection I
have so many go person believe it or not
they have never sponsored me
I've button every GoPro and every
accessory and they've never sponsored me
you guys know how many I go through
these things and then I have a roomful
of retired GoPros GoPros that don't work
anymore so this is my current collection
that actually works and we're headed to
Dale's are you nothing else no you guys
have fun I'll be right back
bye zeusie oh it's our puppy you guys
are the same age I love you cutie judy
judy um you're gonna be on before 9:30
no promises baby daddy's got to work
remember guys it is always too soon to
quit always move forward not backwards
what are you guys doing you know there's
plenty of room right I want to show you
my ringtone there's my teeth that's what
mine is Oh
I love the ending did I got my keys and
his ends like coin
oh and I don't know where you came from
but welcome welcome all right guys so
here I am just got over in my brother's
house what's up we are gearing up for
the race of the century ha ha ha it's
hard for me to explain exactly what
we're doing I'm sitting here building
glow stick rings because Dale has come
up with this idea hey let's hang up glow
stick give them give them a little
example here let's hang up glow stick
rings all over the house and create a
quad copter race yeah here's the issue I
think it's brilliant I think it's a
great idea but I have no experience with
a quad copter and so I have experience
with a quad Roger but I still suck we
both suck at it which may make this even
funnier now this is a video we're making
for his channel so you're gonna get the
behind-the-scenes here but I can't wait
to see these coppers are done dude
they're you consider them dead and they
weren't the cheapest they got cameras
built-in so we can fly from the phones
and they're gonna record first-person
action so if I'm in front you got you
can see from this quadcopter the rear of
mine going towards the wiser rare well
cuz I'm gonna be in front here's what
you guys are gonna see here's the camera
eh okay on fire so we're building glow
stick rings right now that is literally
what we're doing but I think it's
brilliant a couple guys that really knew
how to drive these this would be a riot
this would be so fun I mean it's gonna
be fun either way but so here here we go
let's get cracking this is gonna be
tough
no you got fly mind you're gonna be
you're gonna be my driver mm-hmm we may
need to call him the big guns to even
get a video oh I want to get some crowd
awesome yeah I know it's cool look at
these all right not gonna lie this is
gonna look really good they got your
number four yes mmm no way the only
thing I'll be other hit is the wall does
that count you get points for the law I
actually track points for wallets so
with any luck we'll be at like minus 30
Hyundai was going for a loop
not bad Oh Oh wrong way that one doesn't
do loose all right go for it
are you trying oh just in case any of
you want to try this we're using eight
glow sticks to create the circle
actually those are bigger these are
eight glow sticks oh the race is about
to begin ladies and gentlemen right it's
the glow race glow danger I still think
the lab the finish line should be on
fire the fire ring this is so satisfying
Oh
okay bring it up all the GoPros we need
it's kind of a tricky shot um especially
since you don't know what where the quad
copters are gonna go so I'm kind of
going wide on it but too wide and the
GoPros don't you know capture what's
going on in the background so I think
I'm just gonna put these things
everywhere looks awesome I check this
out race is about to begin my friends
Dale custom paint he's come white
they'll just custom painted them freakin
awesome yeah little permanent marker
handiwork all right we pretty much got
cameras everywhere and here is there's
so many rules we need to know when your
copter falls which it will fall will
fall where do you put what do you do you
start from you start from where you fell
or do you reset at the table mmm
well considering probably neither one of
us is gonna complete the course huh
we're not starting at the tape here or
you started the closest ring now were
you you know we should have done every
time you fall we have takeoff pad in
between each ring you have to place the
copter on the takeoff pad you back to
the would go back to the would and take
off it's gonna be hard enough I just
suck at these like I'm not gonna lie
this will be probably less than a
handful of times I've ever flown one of
these looks good okay I'm gonna go ahead
and start these GoPros up please get
both both angles blades are warming up
mine in anyway Lane one minute I'm in oh
my gosh
alright quadcopters gonna be coming out
of the day I know you want to say any
markets that go
sure alright guys I lied about not being
good at this I'm gonna kill it kill it
kill it straight to the ground ah ah
 you get through some ring basically
we got these glow stick rings around the
house and we're gonna fly throw me yeah
i double-dog dare ya mom and dad just
show up it's so easy I mean and then
take what why don't you take my
controller make the hoop smaller are you
kidding me yeah the finish line should
have been a Pringles can you got to get
through
watch your wind bro all right what's it
win now on your mark okay you gotta sit
yeah on your mark get set go
let's do table oh the ring eaters ladies
evening
the tree all right let's start over
fresh start can't even make it through
one ring that we didn't get to the
starting right now just want to go
straight up all right on your Marlin it
always close that kill it and that's an
eater he hit that thing on your mark get
set go
what is - - oh I'm not gonna say whether
I won that race or lost it but the
trophy was an orange and I'm gonna eat

went from nothing to all the sudden poof
this really big star now and I was like
dude you got it all wrong
I said you he did not just go poof I
said he started with nothing I said you
didn't see it when he was about nine ten
years old making little films in the
house you didn't see it when he did
three full-length little movies and gave
up everything to go to him and try to
sell them and he lost everything in the
process but that was a million miles in
between going from nothing to something
I said woven earned every penny of that
because his life he's not all that great
and that's really what I told him
What did he say he was like oh dude it's
really it people and this was true for
almost everyone who's a success no one
sees what happened behind the scene only
