biggest problem right this is what the
EO eats this is this is what heat this
is what he likes here's my problem I
don't know if I've ever told you guys
this I'm not a hunter I can't
I killed a bird when I was a kid once
with my BB gun true story I felt so bad
I've never kid I can't kill if I hit
something with my car I feel so bad
sorry even this is not for the weak guys
I actually was deciding whether I should
even put this in the vlog because I know
how sensitive everybody is especially
online but this is this is Nate look
this is it's like no different than
having a snake and getting a mouse who's
Nate week that's how they eat what let's
go yeah I'm going so this is real life
guys if you're really if you're really
sensitive probably just fast forward a
little bit cuz I'm gonna try to feed
this eel and I can't show you the tank
but I'm gonna I'm gonna film this eel on
a try I don't know we'll see what
happens let's go
it's like a snake I was alone
it is it's an underwater snake hey
what's my but it's in the tank I don't
care
so it's abs absolutely killing me not to
be able to show you guys this tank but I
think I can show you bits of it I just
can't show you the master shot so I'm
gonna try to get this eel in the shot
and I got I'm gonna be able to film the
feeding of it really I can't get in
there that's gonna be really tough so
this is what he's gonna eat guys
hey salvos like at the store yeah just
like that dude how much is it crawl fish
I didn't even look so Todd just sent me
on a mission to get craw fish
I got him and he says this is what a
weak risky put it down just a little
more oh here he goes yeah he's going
didn't really go out I thought it would
go he did strike at it but then
immediately I guess dropped it now it's
lost don't know where he is mm-me dude
then dan dan dan oh this is bad we
should be laying down like this here
how's my hair ah rocks very good is that
what is that on my shoulder is that all
shoulder okay so oh the feeding of the
eel didn't go the way I planned it to go
