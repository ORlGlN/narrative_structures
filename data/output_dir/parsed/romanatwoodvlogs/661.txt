you called it alright guys we're gonna
switch it up a little bit for you we got
the GTR out maybe try a little snow
drift in we're gonna switch it up for
you got the boys in the GTR and uh you
know it's snowy out so I mean this beast
was made for snow you think it was I
think so we gotta keep it old-school
dudes and when I pull something behind
the car I got the power so we're
bringing the GTR in hopes that this
parking lot up here has snow honest we
can try a little drifting and then yoga
was like let's hook a rope to it pull
somebody all right guys we just headed
over to this little park where we
thought there would be snow we brought
the GTR out the Dudesons want to hook a
sled to the back of the GTR and do some
drifting but there's no friggin snow I
know you guys want to see it and then be
done totally thinking desperate here of
how we can make this work even just one
try on an idea it's snowing so we'll
just wait here
oh he gets some horse now because I get
in Finland snow this is crazy
two ideas for you guys I don't know man
one was just drifting the GTR and the
other one was Yuka's idea to pull
somebody on a sled which would be a riot
whoa
that was awesome I'd read it otherwise I
couldn't see cuz we're not jumped on it
nice that's great
something happened at this park Roman
come summer I'll teach you that okay I
don't if you guys I don't know if you
guys remember you could taught me how to
do a backflip in Venice Beach here's
what I like to do since all right here's
one of their created like they're very
creative human beings and when something
fails they just move to the next thing
but what did you bring oh we got uh this
tiger wetsuit and I was gonna try to
learn how to swim in a little icy pond
but this is how we test if it's cold
enough outside in Finland it's just art
not cool enough that was really brave
though nice we need another -10Â° really
stick it's like it's half frozen half
water no what we really do in Finland we
have those big cruise boats and in the
eyes people go ice skating behind the
cruise boats because that's where the
water kind of takes the snow up so they
jump from ice play to a nice place
seriously and they got new pair of
clothes in their back in a plastic bag
that doesn't get wet so if they fall
down they just use these picks that get
climb up apparent loading and look I got
it there's a whole other planet over
there wrong no for tonight 7:30 p.m.
now we need we need to be out tonight
their flights they're supposed to leave
today tonight their flights just got
canceled
but why is it is it the snowstorm its
really snowing heavy here so here we are
guys out in the wild Buckeye Lake Ohio
we've spotted some type of rare human
kitty please he's wearing human boots
rare sighting of the leopard tiger from
Finland know what I got these this is
how you this is how you get the predator
to go away get them scared with water oh
