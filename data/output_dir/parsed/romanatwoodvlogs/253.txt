first time ever I died in my dream I
died in my dream last night is the
scariest thing I've ever been through I
woke up so freaked out it was actually
like such a crazy feeling I can't
explain I was having like in my dream I
was having pains in my chest and
everybody in my dream was ignoring me
cuz they knew I was dying but they
couldn't look at me they couldn't look
into my eyes and I just was fading away
and right when I died I woke up he
scared me to death but it made me have
so much good energy today I feel so good
to be here
it's a grievous thing I've never had a
dream like that share some of your crazy
dreams for me today man that was crazy

being in town like hey I may not be
happy I'm in town there okay I feel like

okay guys so here's the thing we've been
waiting forever for this and it's
finally here it's hamburger don't show
that what a brain doesn't it doesn't
resemble a brain your brain my brain my
brain easily their for real though I've
had a piece of toast today that's what
I'm fueled on I need to eat what we have
something so exciting is we're waiting
on it forever and every side ok ok so
sick tender
it was dictum but it'd still be too
close always calling it oh I just had a
piece of food that's what it was but it
was like this crazy stuff your hair you
look good are you in write a whole meal
is the pizza ptosis this big this big
around
I'm stuck alright ready whoa here we go
it goes super cool here we come yeah
you're way better at it than me
honey do something fancy boomerang
alright let's do this let's do this so
wait the way is over grill the what push
what are you doing even you sleep in
here anyways I love you more excited
than anybody about this because we have
been custom designing making from
scratch you can't get these anyway these
are ours like we made these they are
here
and they are finally ready already show
too much I got to get them all out I had
to get them all out so we open these
tags welfare photos you need to keep the
tags online first of all we apologize
for taking so long
we could it easily just put our logo on
pre-made digit spinners but we wanted
ours to be one of a kind
they are no other fidget spinner like
this they're all custom numbered there
are different colors they have our logos
on them they have my signature on them
they're very very unique and very very
cool I got to take a tag off so I can do
them and these are the number so this is
1483 at 5,000 here's how it works
right now every single color has 5000
Spencer there's 5000 of each color
that's it every color is pre numbered so
this spinner right here is number 1730
105 thousand so 17:31 5000 of the orange
and black 37 that's number 37 no 3737
Bioman so they're truly one-of-a-kind
guys the spinners are now available on
small more we waited a long time I'm
turning this tie off all right what
number is this this is three thousand
seven hundred ninety seven to five
thousand it's now mine farad I don't
know if anybody really understands how
long I can't do that now they go like
that you know long I've been wanting to
tell you guys about these like how much
work and time and waiting
why tweeted it last week is like wait
any longer but guys they're available
right now there's only 5000 of each so
if you want one or all four get them
right now because they will sell out
these are going to go fast and they're
numbered so what number will you get
that's the mystery of these numbers nope
they'll never be made again these are
one-of-a-kind they'll never be remade so
whatever number you get that's your
number so have at it have some fun with
it
tell me and tweet me what number you get
because that is that's cool like these
are so random
same exact number this is 2736 or 5,000
right here you cannot pick your number
either you cannot pick them there in all
these boxes look how many boxes and
we're going to just ship them like if
you order one it goes in a bag like
that's it you don't pick can't down to
that tent down to down a dead-end

right guy I'm the exterminator oh you
get rid of them outside cuz they're
everywhere well just more purple stuff
baby mm-hmm Paulette boy specific there
you go get some speed get some speed oh
oh hey honestly to do the whole counter
in these spinners that'll be like
forever
look how they look how they come guys
look they come all bagged to knees like
this so you have to open every bag let's
save everybody
yeah because they're just little dip
ease whoa that's a lot of splinters dude
so for this idea to do a photo of the
whole counter and spinners maybe for the
website or something fun and goofy but
we didn't really how long it's going to
take cause we got a they actually come
in these little zip bags and we have to
take them all out but we'll have to put
them back in that's a whole nother
process so we're just going to clean
we're good did it it did it did it
even shelling chocolate boss from dusk
till dawn
is this so funny we're literally just
opening shelling show well I'll tell you
this if you happen to get lucky number

ones will actually be in the video
because there's so many all were in the
600 that's what these are resin 682 4000
