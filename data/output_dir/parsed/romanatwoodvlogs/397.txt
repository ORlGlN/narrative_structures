I'll be back in just a bit give me my
tough boy Oh daddy's gonna be back man
okay I love you dude
all right thumbs up you want me oh do
you definitely know how to make if you
love man welcome to the vlog guys it is
not always leaving my house I wanted to
put that in the vlog today to show you
how real sometimes it is leaving home
the kids aren't always happy for us to
leave camus just heart broke that I had
to go today ah he's gonna have so much
fun there's a part of me that's like you
of course he's gonna have a blast but
there's a part of me like you'll never
feel more loved when your kid is hugging
you begging you not to leave like that
is true love how come you don't how come
you don't do that when I live I do some
guys it's gonna be a good day however we
have to start this vlog with probably
the most boring thing ever and something
that I would never even want to bring
you guys along on but it is life and it
is real life I have to pay taxes today
is the final day if you're a business
owner today is the final day to pay
taxes now keep in mind this is after we
filed extensions so this is like your
final day after extensions I think from
what my accountants telling me is I need
to get my butt in and finalize this so
my hands are all beat-up from running
the ball my knees let me show you this
dude if you watch the birthday vlog my
knees are all banged up from the bowl my
knuckles are all beat up look at this
man I just knock the scab off at kiss it
make it better
hisses baby
we are headed to write the biggest check
I've ever written in my life and I think
it's pretty messed up that the biggest
check I've ever written in my life goes
to our government - taxes like I don't
get them I don't get to spend that money
on something cool and fun I get to hand
it over to the federal and state mmm
don't go puke in this car it's not mine
yeah Brittany's test driving another car
is just fake guys it's the same thing we
just test drive it's all black
everything see you like the black one
better
oh she's scarier so I don't know I don't
know if I like the chrome do you like I
like the chrome you like the black
better uh-huh
it's a big vehicle when you shoot on by
school bus or something like bigger
right yellow I mean I think it'd just be
easier to just take one of my arms or
one of my legs this is bad no don't tell
you about youtubers like they don't tell
you like your favorite youtuber like
they tell you how much they make but
they don't tell you what they have to
pay in taxes like that number you see is
tax free so don't believe everything you
see it's pretty brutal on the back end
here comes the pain and here comes the
pain all right man where do you want to
start let's just wake me up when it's
over did you're all beat up
it looks like we got into a brawl I know
it was it was stabbed from that slide
and then I was doing these like what
things - then it just ripped it right
out
oh thank you take the car back baby take
it back you're not getting it we got no
more money we don't have no more money
no more money we don't have no hi I
think that's enough business for one day
if I told you what we just spent on
taxes you would probably throw up but
that's being a business owner that is
part of life that's part of growing and
in doing what we have to do we were
going right now to see one of my
favorite artists of the time right now
it really hasn't been listened to him a
lot his name's in F Brittany has even
been listening to him like crazy and
just been listening to his music a lot
you guys probably even seen us where it
is merch in our vlogs we just we've been
a supporter of his tonight we actually
get to go hang out watch him watch his
show and they're just so fun it's a cool
date night and we'll just get a little
time together last time in the haunted
house which was great you had a great
time tell him tell me I tell me her

were all over me it was great it's like
I'm we're actually dating again
I remember those first dates

crazy it's just different once you've
been together eight years
I know what it's like it's like it like
takes me back to like my M&M days you
know but like I'm an adult now and I
have kids and he's like I can listen to
him with my kids and that's a huge thing
for a father
I got safe music that my kids can listen
to it's like good influence or kids you
can listen to them and not worry about
all the bad language and parents you can
let your kids listen to somebody has a
good message without any bad language
I've never heard bad language that's not
normal human Columbus dude I haven't
seen a Viper forever I've never seen a
purple Viper she gets Karl tears about
what five seconds before you grab the
baby she walked in and said all right
where's my baby he scooped it right up
oh he's just like waiting around the
corner last night my god she's gonna

story of the year yeah there we go

we're behind the Newport Music Hall and
it brings back so many memories we did
so many pranks down these alleys right

skunk on an RC and like putting masks on
and jumping out of people like the
originals like og og yo yo what's up man

out there dude awesome so we just got in
finally meeting the man himself naked

uh we've been like slowly talking like
through uh Twitter and then we actually
talked on the phone trying to come up
with something cool to do with you guys
and we actually came up with nothing
there nothing we came up with nothing to
do so this is it this is his best idea
like we're gonna hang out in the dirty
backstage of the Newport small the
long-standing venues in the country uh
so that's what the that's a Thursday I
was on a plane back from China sitting
on the plane I was like I need new music
so bad I just have to jog out at the
desk yeah this is true so I was on the
flight back from trans like a 13-hour
flight or something was like I currently
need something to listen to and it was
just at the time you were like it was
like Drake Drake you yeah that's like
who is this like and I clicked on it my
swear I think I listening to your intro
okay I'm therapy session 20 seconds 30
seconds 40 seconds and I'm like download
everything you ever
and I listened to it probably four times
on the flight home I was instantly
hooked man instantly I'm in Rome talking
about like touring experiences and there
was one point in my career there's a lot
of times people just see like what we do
is artists or you know creators and
stuff they see like it not so they see
like a tour of us now they see a crew
now like all these cool lights and stuff
but at one point in my career I had a
did a tour whole tour for like $1,000
but I was like actually part of the crew
as well and we did 29 shows in 30 days
and we like slept in two bands a truck
that we drove in so we were like
sleeping like this and like host homes
were we like sleep in random people's
houses sometimes nice and they didn't
know it and they didn't know it well
they were going to sleep there but some
of the actors like they bring help how
long ago was that tour man probably five
five years four years see people like
honestly I have people I like think that
even I was an overnight sensation but
they don't know I've been doing this
since I could hold a camera just like
you you've been creating me do you know
what I was at I was doing a
meet-and-greet on my tour I was wearing
in a hat
yeah and somebody said they went to high
school with you and they remember you
walking around with like a CD look like
your track yeah I should be that so you
were hustling and I love that I said or
bleep that's what I say about all my
original videos I'm like they're
terrible yes because you go back and
watch them in your that looks for no I
just deleted like 100 of our videos
they're so good we had a happen we had a
host on one night where we like showed
up and there was like we're all like
exhausted of course and then like
there's like 12 kids running around and
we're like what the heck is going like
walk done and uh it's like they didn't
even know that we're gonna stay there
they did looks like they didn't even
care like there was this animal hair
everywhere I'm not even joking I was
like stains all over the bed like I
literally took one of my friends like
sheets out of his bag laid it out of bed
I like kicked all these like dirty
clothes like I'm not even exaggerating
hair everywhere I like laid it on the
bed and I like curl up in wall did I
tell you guys this all the time do not
expect don't expect success overnight
don't be afraid to fail many times like
it comes just do what you love
everything else will come with it money
is a byproduct of doing what you love
and now dude you have a new single
that's killing like I think I I think I
saw like number three I to Israel yeah
dude yes good awesome and I love it the
craziest backstage with a new purpose
pretty no no keep going okay so I'm
going to try to film some of the show
but last time I filmed the concert it
just was just base
