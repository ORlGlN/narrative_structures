hey hey guys it is a beautiful day and
Toronto Canada the road trip is about to
begin
we're going to Niagara Falls of course
it's breakfast and you're eating a bowl
of chili that's right
man I want you to feel like you're at
home is chilly you're doing the Tim
Hortons you know pretty cool here is
something pretty cool we stopped at a
Wendy's Tim Hortons Tim Hortons started
in Canada and now is all over Ohio
Wendy's started in Ohio and it's all
over Canada it's pretty cool I don't
know maybe not
ladies Jesus Oh
oh my god you're right
I just need a minute
so we have had an absolute wonderful
time in Toronto the place has been
beautiful the weather has been great we
are on our road trip back home we're
actually going to make a stop at Niagara
Falls shut that out we've never been on
the Canadian side in fact Brittany and I
went to Niagara Falls right before we
actually started vlogging yeah right
before we started daily vlogging so this
will be the first time in the vlogs
we've ever been here just a mind-blowing
experience this is beautiful my wait to
get to the gate up here to show you but
you can see how many gallons of water is
flowing over them like how is it not
empty up there Brittany says she looks
like a boy today Wow Wow Wubbzy
I would imagine that most of you know
what Niagara Falls are but some of you
around the world probably don't this
side is America and this side is Canada
I've never been on the Canadian side
yeah are you don't walk into the bus why
not this is the smaller Falls and those
are people I actually feel like I have
been right here when I was a little kid
my mom and dad brought us here
and a family asked my dad to take a
picture for him and when they handed my
dad the camera he ran across the street
like he stole it like he was a prank he
was pranking them ah so they were like
Louie will you take our picture they
handed him their camera and then he took
off so my dad was pranking when I was a
little kid that's where you got it from
yeah what do you think pretty wicked
something actually really crazy about
these Falls people used to ride off the
Falls in barrels that is true that is
true and many people died many people
died many people survived but can you
imagine
getting inside a barrel I mean that
alone is scary
but then riding on that is crazy hot
pepper store I wouldn't even know what
to get like maybe we should get a super
hot sauce for our house for my guests
come over this seems to be all they have
different kinds of it should we get like
a crazy one like this
no I want to ask them what's the hottest
I got a good idea
oh really don't whoa it comes in like a
you just pull the pin and throw it at
somebody okay so we got a little treat
for our next special guest maybe
hopefully they don't watch this blog
won't even reveal
okay last but not least it wouldn't be a
trip to Canada without eating the famous
poutine and I know you guys would kill
us if we didn't try so we're gonna do it
right now what's the place called Pete
smokes petite area smokes poutine
poutine
do you like poutine you like poutine
what is that continue but we're gonna
give this place a shot and check this
out real glass bottles
oh you can't oh you cannot be soda pop
whatever you want to call it in a glass
bottle it's the best ready so this is
poutine basically french fries covered
in bacon Hamburg well you can get it all
different ways and you got chicken you
got Curtis just curds and plaintain
break out kind of what I got with
chicken
okay so cool teen poutine is very heavy
on the gut weighs a lot it's like eating
an automobile a covered except you don't
feel comfortable after yes lick your
skillet yesterday mad your is kind of
like the heavy meal stunt hanging out
with you pee
so this is where we call our trip the
end we will be leaving Toronto headed

to shoot some guns yeah I love so that's
something that we can always do with our
guests is hang you and shoot some get a
stress reliever
