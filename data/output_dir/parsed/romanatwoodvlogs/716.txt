the little uh-oh okay you guys may
remembered what a couple months ago if
that Carl and I would always be playing
with these little lights and the blogs
and you guys were always like what are

that you get with the small more pad
these aren't even available in stores
yet you have it first you throw it into
your phone watch roll check this out
you just pull it out hahaha okay like
we're like just big kids getting to goof
off with these little lights so we're
gonna run around the streets today
and kind of go old-fashioned like we
used to out on the streets and goof off
interact with people and mess with the
lights obviously work better when it's
dark out yeah yeah like pulling lights
out I'm going we're going you can just
grab a light from that little wreath
we're going to 16 Baker in a little bit
too and that'll be it'll look really
cool about yeah right on so the reason
all the cameras are here today is Carl
thought would be gonna get shoot
commercial for these little guys which I
think
lady ago so where would you see a TV
commercial so you'll see them in retail
stores like you'll see them at Walmart
and the in-store TVs and you know when
we're in 52 countries with right bug so
it'll actually be on TV in Japan and
Europe and that's a crazy crazy that's a
whole nother world for me I'm just used
to you - yeah just YouTube I mean not TV
yeah I guess what's up buddy one thing
really cool hey actually used to do a
lot of filming here and it's really
weird to be able to just come in we have
video permission and we have a
hoverboard
and I don't think I'm gonna get yelled
at for this I think I'm good you got
permission for us
No
or we're crap get this guy I do it do it
do it
that's right books call strapping on his
futuristic Back to the Future shoes it
does that there self-lacing because you
lace of yourself
did you ever see like the behind the
scenes how they did that there's like
six down it's like Lang out of the
camera like strapping them on it's
awesome all right guys we're moving
locations right now I'm not gonna lie I
have it went out on the streets with
cameras for a while so fun literally
having flashback memories like the
greatest feeling I need to get back out
on the streets I'm serious
so we're going to move locations head
over to 16-bit this is a place you've
seen in the blogs but they're letting us
film there so that's why we're going so
Carl I we just stopped here at dirty
Frank's the hot dog place and we want to
show you you it is this shipment of the
smile more bright bugs come with a
little bonus that I got to show you this
so it's a hologram you're reaching you

love that movie and look what else they
got pinball machines I'm not getting
nothing done today I actually like this
part of everyone sorry guys
I'm busy I'm playing pinball let's see
it here we go right you can take the

little light this is cool so this is a
TV show TV commercial that's going to

you
yeah
growing three two one action
okay
and I'm rolling
so on I think nothing rolling
trying to make it look like the light
bug powers on yeah they're doing like a
flick aside futuristic type thing with
the lights power things commercial so
basically the timing the plug-in of the
old machine with the light
rolling
we are on the move to the next location
I don't think it's far for look at this
city right now man pretty cool
I don't know having a lot of fun today
like I love this stuff like any anything
just goofing off on cameras it's like I
like it I'm really I've noticed my
weakness though my weakness is when
people say action like 3 2 1 action
rather than just filming me like if I'm
just able to be filmed and run around
I'm I'm so naturally me but some reason
when they say action I like I don't know
I'm not that I'm not an actor I'm not
good at acting so we just jumped over to
my buddy's studio here this place is
sick look at that wall but tell them
