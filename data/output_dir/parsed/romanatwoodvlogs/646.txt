I want to share a little secret with you
guys so a lot of you don't know when
people are up on stage they have to go
potty just like the rest of you out here
in the audience the only difference is
we can't so last night was like I drank
like six bottles of water before we went
out so during the second half I don't
know if you noticed but I was like dying
I had to pee so bad by time we got off
stage I was running out the whole second
half I'm holding my arm in pain I can't
tell them why it was bad so as each show
goes on Pablo becomes more famous and
fat last night he comes out on stage the
whole place goes bobner
I was insane but as that happens he's
treating us better look at this he's the
one that brings all of this every single
night oh no it's for you
