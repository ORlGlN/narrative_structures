the camera supply shop to find a bag
that holds all my equipment because I
don't feel like putting anything under
the plane I want it all with me and I
just thought I'm a bag that holds
everything including my laptop so I'm
gonna see if it's possible to find that
bag it might be too big or too heavy I
don't know
so we'll see see I think I'm actually
just always looking for excuses to come
