hello hello my friends how are you Oprah
days awesome as always I'm headed to
return the little jelly bean I'm
actually getting used to this car and
I've slowly fallen in love with it
because I can park anywhere and get
anywhere in this city with it but it's
gonna be easier with a Ford or with a
cane I'm gonna miss you baby I'm gonna
miss you
I actually fall in love with this thing
I've just upgraded to the four-door it's
almost the same before doors so much
easier for us because we grocery shop
and we got the kids and we got you know
we're a little bit different lifestyle
so we need a big four-door this is
perfect alright guys so today is
Britney's birthday super exciting
believe it or not we're such a team that
we're always side by side we've never
really apart so I thought today I would
sneak off while I went and got this car
and find her look
Britta loves exercising running jogging
whatever it is and right now it's like
this she's got her giant iphone and
she's holding it with earphone ear plugs
and trying to jog so they got these
awesome little iPod nanos it's tiny
and I thought it would fit like right in
our pocket teamed up with like some
wireless earbuds the only problem is
they got all these different colors so I
just text her I just said pick one
purple green blue red white so while I
wait on her response she got me a pair
of these for Christmas
they're like earbuds that are wireless
she's fallen in love with them she likes
him a lot so I'm gonna pair that up with
the iPod light and it should be like the
perfect gift ever so this is awesome how
awesome is this gift guys come on be
honest with me these little nanos are
sweet for exercising teamed up with some
wireless earbuds she better freaking
smile she better freakin smile so hard
to sneak away like Britt and I are like
neck and neck we're always side by side
we're team which makes it really hard to
sneak off and get birthday gifts or
presents so it's literally last second I
mean they're a good boyfriend or a bad
boyfriend oh okay so I had to run in and
get one more gift from places called
Lululemon not a fan so much I'm not
against it I just don't wear anything in
there Brittany loves it so instead of
trying to find her something that I
would think she would like I just got
her a gift card all right if you guys
watch these vlogs a lot then you know I
always get the opposite of what card I'm
supposed to get so if it's birthday I
might get like happy graduation if it's
graduation I might get happy birthday I
always get something opposite I think
it's funner and funnier that way cuz you
always write what you want to write
anyway brother from sister that might be
a little much about grandpa happy
birthday grandpa yeah all right I think
I found it
you're a teenager now this is way too
funny to me
happy sixth birthday I could just go on
all day with these big 3rd birthday I
like this one a lot for anybody thinking
I'm stupid for this this is way fun of
them being serious I love it
alright so fun some sweet wrapping paper
yeah you had to buy everything to keep
this a secret scissors
a panda right in the card tape wrap the
gifts it's funny she's gonna watch this
vlog tomorrow and be like you're crazy
haven't got our funny gift I got our
funny gift
hey this Barbie plates and cut dude what
girl doesn't want that no I think I'm
gonna I think I'm gonna put from Kane on
this one cuz it's so cute and funny my
work station is pretty sweet guys I'm
getting everything wrapped it's so funny
you got my little breakfast here yeah
everything you need just filled out the
card I'm really push it even read this
to you but uh here's here's what I wrote
in the card
Britt I love you so much thank you for
standing beside me when I had nothing
thank you for being my best friend in
the world you're truly my best friend I
can't imagine a day without you in my
life you are my greatest accomplishment
happy sixth birthday if you take
anything from me today take anything
from this vlog take this don't take life
so serious you know it's not about the
cost of the gifts or what size to give
this I'll probably get a bigger happier
reaction out of the happy sixth birthday
card and the little princess place to
tell you the truth I mean it's not about
the gift just don't be so serious have
fun with life life is so awesome don't
take it for granted make people happy
and smile and be fun it's it's it's so
much funner than being negative and down
I think so is that I buddy
