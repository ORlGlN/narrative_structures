about relationships because most you

how long have you been with Britannian I
tell them the story and then most of the
time a lot of people explain how the
relationships are right and it is never
as good as ours it's your story when I
tell them how we are they're just like
that's impossible and it really does
feel like that so thank you for being my
best friend and the best girl in my life

we can be together 24 hours a day I mean
we've worked together we live together
every second of the day most people have
different jobs and they you know they
come home to each other at night but
Brittany and I are together 24 hours a
day for most of the time now when I
