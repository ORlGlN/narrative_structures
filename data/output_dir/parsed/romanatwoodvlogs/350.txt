guys so here we are towards the end of
the vlog I hung out with the family mom
and dad and we kind of just goofed off
talked about some crazy ideas my dad
still wants to launch the GPS tracker in
the giant helium balloon and see where
it lands which I actually thinks a great
idea so we're looking into that idea um
I'm totally down for that would you
gotta make sure it's like we can do it
this thing might land in your backyard
like I don't know where it's gonna go
I've looked online and some of these
balloons have traveled really far like
insanely far so it could be something
fun to do and then we could all watch it
live like where this balloon is live on
on this website it's crazy that being
said I feel like we'll be more on track
like we have been for the last 10 days
but tomorrow we will be hearing the
baby's heartbeat for the first time
which to me is the prime example of what
we want to capture on these vlogs for
our future and I don't know I just feel
like it's a real moment for us to be
sharing with you guys I mean it's crazy
I will be spending the rest of my night
doing all the photos for smile more and
doing business stuff things that I just
don't think you're that interested in
