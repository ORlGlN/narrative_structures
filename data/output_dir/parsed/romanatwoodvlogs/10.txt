battle grounds hoodie busted good you
set up like a super dope so purred oh
you already got your thing up here
that's awesome
that's cool I think we're lucky to even
have power right now because it has been
so storming it's so windy like it's
another level of wind so I'm like it's
just a minute before the power is gonna
be left a bridge open I love a kids
house but this is like you've been
taking over kids officially on this
house well I did do that that's my doing
right there but I like a fun house I
like I like a responsible house like a
rock boiler houses not very small but
not like a fun house when I grew up it
was always like the house she went to
that was super strict you weren't
allowed to like everything was so
uptight and I couldn't stand that so I
grew up with the mindset that my house
is gonna be a fun place give me a fun
place to raise kids and for them to play
and have fun and when people come over
here they know it's okay to be a little
loose you know you guys probably have
that one person it's like they like
you have like a plastic mat going
through the carpet you can only stand on
that mat or like it was like I don't
know our house was never like that my
parents were like me look very
loosey-goosey but we also you know we
didn't have a lot that could be damaged
so it's a little different now when I
grew up you really couldn't miss our
house up it was already the worst as it
could get so yeah maybe maybe that's why
it was so loose okay so on this part
guys yesterday Brian jumped his x3 over
the fiery jump and I had a great picture
this is actually the raw photo of what
I'm talking about there's no editing
there's no coloring this is the actual
photo and it looks like it's straight
