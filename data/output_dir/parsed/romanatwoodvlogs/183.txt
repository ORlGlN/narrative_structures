hi baby girl
Oh is she trying to poop or what it
looks like poop face get her Cora get
your mommy welcome to the vlog we are a
course up so I wanted to like start now
because she's been sleeping most of the
day she's you for it you for it on
camera
there's lips that's my favorite face she
does but you could it you could edit in
whistling what it's the millions of
facial expressions every minute like she
holds she only hold it for a split
second I can't wait to you're giggling
and laughing and running around with me
hey boy
I was at my niece Jimmy I saw you coming
to give me some lovin ah she's got the
gone for the day she got the young to do
you do don't eat will you
mm-hm diaper up big brother so welcome
guys Britney wants to wake horror but
yet you should definitely wear after she
hears number two Derek to number two is
- that's right wait what's number three
I was going to totally scare you all the
camera beep we tried we want to do
something we try to yesterday but we did
not have time you guys want to show em
what we're going to do huh I will be
okay open them well that's a good
question it's going to be tricky
I know like yeah because when they're
frozen they're easy to pull apart but
when they're not frozen and they're just
juice they rip in the middle okay let's
see it how much she weigh and now you
just put her on that it seriously that's
awesome
she's getting fussy now that's crazy
eight nine pound two more else is low
girl
there's 16 ounces in a pound so she's 8
14 which means she need two more okay so
how are we going to do this we need to
think okay hear me let me start to where
I'm supposed to supposed to start doors
poppin bottles in here first of all look
at that that's like a bottle cake we
have this ice maker that makes all these
awesome ice cubes I love to say we love
this thing but we're thinking if you pop
this out that's where you put the water
but what in oh geez how do we get that
water out of here that's that's all you
can pull it you can pull the drain so
our thought is we empty out the water in
we pour solid liquid popsicles and this
is a great idea dude
take a while I know but that's why I
want to start it now so we'll actually
have it done how's your waffle
how's that waffle boy what do we do with
this ice put in a big bag a big bag big
bag my gosh dude look at this power ball
okay I want to make a mess I have a
feeling huh oh here comes
wasn't that actually yeah
did you already drain it are you cool
you gotta push it that way okay I can't
baby come on I gotta hold the camera
you're only holding a baby yeah okay let
me get it okay
I'll get them down hover be okay okay
now just pop this thing on which one oh
yes we can
leak it leak it oh you do both yes
let there be ice surety back to sleep
she's are you sleeping look at that big
brother helping out around here alright
I think I got all the water out so this
thing should be ready to go there's some
ice cubes done so we were going to make
our own drinks and put them in there but
popsicles are mixed so perfectly between
water and sugar that they freeze evenly
so I figured this thing will just make
baby popsicles that you pour in a cup
and then to be awesome
yes where should we do for I feel like
since it is going to take so green
here's what I'm thinking I think we just
cut them all open and pour man and then
you come back so we know okay just do
light colors then like pink red and
orange all of those we are going to
separate all the colors and then decide
as a family painted green but looks like
there's more red and pink you can mix
those all right okay Cain you're on rock
Patrol you're on Ross Patrol dude it's
like rock me bud actually they come over
better than oh my gosh wait you sprayed
are we mixing colors are we just going
with one color I mean it would be
awesome to take our time and do every
single color and then you'd have like
bowls of mixed colored ice and flavors
right we should test it in a cup like
all over the others before I can tell
you did all the like said that's right
just got to get it in my cup oh my gosh
you're good
got it cut cut slice there you go
oh yeah no not you are the ugly cubes
right there be like swamp but they taste
great that's a lot of juice out of five
six public so we'll definitely be able
to pick a color and do it let's get cut
and do these are be amazing no ice cubes
just cut and pour cutting pour that's
all we can do my gosh this thing is
never going to be right again
Oh core the things you get to do when
you get a little bigger you guys try to
keep up with these boys all right last
blue one cane that's it put the last one
on let's start making some cubes now we
wait we'll take forever dude so we're
going to wait on that that's going to be
amazing like that's going to be fun just
don't little blue cubes in your cup and
eat them like popsicle well they will be
Menshikov Stickles when blue stone will
do green and then maybe we'll just mix
it all up before our house is 3 level 4
bathroom right where she sleeps for
quality Bolin early things and from
basement for storage
that's pretty loaded right there well
the hooligans are here so they're going
to jump on video games probably right
what's your favorite thing to do in the
whole world Colin I'll think about it
no good I want you to take a powerful
person want you for everything to do in
the world come to Oakland Romans house
yeah ok ok have fun
I'm gonna run outside what do you would
what in Jamaica her makeup her brush oh
boy this house about it about to turn
into a girl's house no it's been it's
been all guys it's been all guys we
we've ruled the world for so long but
it's being taken over
okay we've got Liza we've got Gilroy
I've brought something for you oh geez
is it McDonald's no no no okay
oh she's so cute what's the picture
under can I shut on the look
yeah it's product oh that's Britton
Veronica Liza are you gonna take over my
house yeah
see I knew it I'm predicting the future
already real country still be still salt
and be so fast just take it easy on the
face really sad what are we gonna do
today
do it how are we going to fix a bike
that's been underwater for 24 hours I
have I have a bunch of ideas like I feel
like I like Noah's idea notes that get a
ton of rice and put the book in right I
think it's an iPod girl like that she's
demanding she get what she wants she
stuff to know if she like no first
obstacle is actually getting a bike out
in the water so I'm pretty confident I
can take it apart and like clean and get
it back working but yeah I can say yeah
I can I can do that for sure I guess it
please okay just in case you missed
yesterday's vlog it was a very great
flaw but country you got to watch
yesterday's vlog for this to make sense
country is still out not still I mean he
came back today and he's so just like he
can't get oh he's bummed about his bike
he looks genuinely so doesn't he like we
got it I don't know what to say what to
do yo country where did you even get
kettle corn first of all you know they
say when you get the from me hey flash
you got your country some love and all
he wants is your popcorn sauce Oh daddy
give you a chance dude there you go boy
I've never seen that before
there you go boy so when we got any what
are we gonna do like I know ways to get
the bike out but what even if we get the
bike out what do you think like it's not
good man
you wanna know the truth yeah I had that
bike for an hour and I lost it in a
minute and that bike a bike deserves to
get out that fat problem and it hasn't
planted I just want I just want to hold
it back and know that we could bring it
back to life
this is needs a proper burial
oh we got a couple ideas to get your
bike back today chase what was your idea
idea number one we tied cinderblock to
country's ankle right and we throw men
where we think the bike is is probably
bad idea I'm just going to shut that one
down now what's your next idea okay we
could hide some really heavy weights to
a fishing line with super big hook yeah
dad I like that I like fishing for it
right we could also get like a big
magnet on a rope and toss it and it'll
grab the bike it won't pull it up but
we'll know where it is that's pretty
smart
what if we had like a fish finder right
like you're on a boat and you got you
know hanbok is it a bike finder and just
look like a really big fish in my
opinion I don't know flesh but you can't
have the corn dude you can't look how
bad he was you had to do a backflip I
think they found the popcorn ah I say
they found the popcorn over me just
figure to the bag looks really funny
donkey Empire is a vegetarian EEE grazes
on the land eats grass but any chance he
gets he will run for his dog food or
weird things like Josh not suppose he
does crazy these guys look at me it's
the kettle corn it's not just you man
they like the corn go crazy so we gotta
go get some we need supplies like I
don't have hooks I don't have anchors or
anything to grow I have rope that I have
we need like a grappling hook but like a
hooked one I have a flat one they won't
I don't think I don't think it worked
hey where can we get um we were can we
get like a hook like a big giant hook
like that we can throw rope in and like
snag a snag a bike snag a boat
snag a lot I don't have anything like
anybody Oh where's a medium weight with
the medium here
yo that funky pressed it over pull y'all
right looks good when I pull it off sure
ha ha that's a trick question of course
I can pull it off watch the food you
know that's pretty cool
I loved it I'm glad we love black yeah
because we had white wine did not live
right with this we'll do the spin you
guys been around oh yeah yeah but I was
wanting fishes up on that yeah I
actually use the word depressed Wally a
kettle for when he didn't kettle corn
you know it's like I'm implying yeah
it's not a good time are you gonna we
got to help them
um but you have to get this on society
they'll be on the site maybe right now
I'm a multitasker here ready here's the
pictures give me on the site
hoodies now available Lincoln bio hey
you know what nobody actually answered
my question where do we get a hook like
I feel like we got to run out and get a
hook somewhere there's a shark sore on
earth what do you mean I can't leave to
see it a look make a hook captain hook
baby think about it oh you've got Robles
I've got rope we got that covered tie it
around the head down
hello how you gonna tie it around it
please if you can get me that bar I can
get this fight around the trampoline
doubled it down at stake you cilinder
stakes it's like a hook right that's a
great thing for y'all no no New York
Strip Arriba t-bone t-bone all right
we'll figure it out we'll figure it out
that's all I got to say good I feel like
that was a person great job on hoodies
lady this is all of them there's a top
position okay I know this looks like a
lot but hoodies take up a lot of space
if you want a hoodie just get a hoodie
now because last time I released tie-dye
shirts they were out instantly and
everybody was like I didn't get a shirt
so there you go go get him right now
does she have like a little tie-dye
onesie that would be awesome
she does have a smile more onesie I know
to wear your employee shirt for us honey
all ready to work yet you can come here
any to work yet
all right I figured out your mom's up at
the grill she's like cooking and clean
it's way too hot out for a hoodie right
now winter is coming winter is coming
maybe if we just search garages and
basements we'll find some country I'm
working man I'm trying my best
I really want to get you your bike today
I guess the only the only goal right now
hey what about what about a tire wrench
put a rope here we just start dragging
and flagging I don't know if that's
gonna really hook but I know what you're
saying
everything's were just trying to be
optimistic here I'm trying to think
outside the box this is not everyday
throw back into a pond well I guess you
don't have the right stuff for that why
don't we have a paper that we will next
time what about this umbrella handle
what about that bro look tell me that
won't hook oh you know I just found it I
just found it in our amazing rock garden
right here the bird feeder dude you drop
that in that's gonna hook it right this
is the hook and we can tie a rope down
there
that is definitely a hook country we're
getting your bike we're in your bike see
Brett I knew when you bought this bird
feeder we were going to use it like it
is
look dude this is it this is everyone
laughing at my idea let's go no that's
good that's good we riding on that bike
today only sitting on I love that my dad
started a rope factory like I'ma be
honest like my whole life you always
need rope and when you have rope you
realize how much you can use rope
thanks dad for starting that rope back
you know what's that movie let's that
maybe we're world Fair's like whoever
invented rope some real I think we got

mistake here yeah you get country bike
