got an interesting story for you and the
viewers I remember sitting at this table
probably five years ago with my buddy
Dennis
he was sitting where you're sitting we
were filming and I said we were nobody
we were broke as no money and I
said dude in six months everything's
gonna change
the only thing about that story is six
months after that and we became
youtubers no joke and that's a here
right here at this table do what's the
six-month prospect for us right now and
I don't know we got a we got to get back
to the show the real story and it's
actually bringing back memories because
this is what we have to film on these
streets every chance we could it is all
we have
we're stuff like fat rats and Casey does
some pretty crazy things first of all he
films with a massive camera and
yesterday you dropped this right
I bought this last night yes yes

right now first a mighty 2010-2011
blogger
no yes that was probably right yeah
we've been trying to make this happen
for a long time and even this was hard
to make happen because our schedules
like our opposite okay you want to take
them off we can cut them now we thought
Casey hit a million subscribers on
YouTube this week so we thought it would
be cool to cover his bedding crap okay
so yesterday yesterday you guys saw us
try to do this watermelon experiment
let's see
books it looks exactly the same it's
really wiry
we suck at this we should not try to
speed it up what do you know well we

throughout he's showing me all these
ridiculous things you can do it might be
dead it's not dead it's alive I didn't
even know you could do these things on
this look at it it's so bad Oh
it's really fast

what this trips all about me 5kc sitting
inside I'm gonna try to play a prank on
him I'm gonna take his camera apart and
put it on the ground and make him think
I dropped it
drop the camera dude I was carrying it
in for you
I was walking in for you and dropped it
I've had this for a whopping 18 hours
what do you think can Frank and then I
have good luck I tripped this is why I'm
not friends with any pranksters this is
this is why you have your friends of
these guys welcome welcome to the house
I thought you were gonna turn around
like a hundred times I'm like trying to
figure out how to get that thing on it's
a good camera dude everything's good

we're gonna
no it's like how I passed time in my
blood
and we're getting some supplies for
tomorrow that's good war we like drove
your car and then block yeah but what's
up bruh how are you I am clearly trying
to message you to see if you ever wanted
to get together and actually watch did
you I got the message that's why I'm
here huh what's up okay I'm trying to
figure out why we came here Brittany
said we need a silly-string
yeah we do need some over here so for
any of you that watch Casey's vlogs you
may know that his vlogs are just well
they're kind of cooler than mine so
here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna do
a scene and then we're gonna do the
exact same way case a vlog take over a
vlog take over so this is my scene all
right and you guys know how I usually
vlog okay so this is how it would be all
right guys we're at the store we need to
come Brittany needed some silly string
so we're here to get that and I think
that's it yeah what did I say I said
don't let me fall
you had one job so that's the difference
between how I vlog and how I see by the
way that ball was not on purpose
that's all a mail drop the beat okay
yeah so Casey's boys are cool like he
puts so much work we just spent between
five and ten minutes doing that tiny
thing he does that all day down in every
scene count no I like that officially
have everything we need for a birthday
party
one two three four five six seven cans
of silly string we're not going to a
birthday party
I honestly don't know why we're getting
this Oh but these are awesome these huge
party poppers alright we're on our way
home I don't know if you can see me but
we're gonna give Casey a little launch
in the GTR what what's a lot what are
you doing here so the car has a little
launch sequence where you can push a
couple buttons and it basically takes
the RPMs up and then you just release
I'm gonna try to record my speedometer
which is really hard and just drive I
mean we're gonna do an automatic so it's
not as fast but it's still pretty fast
ready

Kane just get back home
