sorry he got this car everybody wants to
race guys how are you how are you is a
beautiful day it's humid it's hot it
kind of coming Jim Jim Jim Jim phone
lady formally we gotta we gotta pass
them kind of more of a business date a
guy for Bob I guess real life day last
few days wing fun project days and I
think I got a project today but for now
a little bit of business got to run out
tomorrow we launched a brand new smile
more website which is super exciting for
us as a family and that just means going
and making final approvals and just
checking on everything before we go live
so that's what I want to do right now
thanks for joining us and supporting
this channel it's been so much fun
lately and let's get this day started
thanks for watching ok so meet the team
everybody these guys are the ones
responsible for this new website and
look at the kind of things this will
instead of just a flat picture this will
actually happen when you take your mouse
and you go over say the water bottles
it's going to animate like that on the
screen I think it's pretty cool I mean
definitely above what I could do myself
so that's exciting
what else you got blow my viewers mind
so they were saying like the spinners
like when you go over them they'll spin
I think that's that awesome
this is contextual vessel she's just
looking up the whole district okay so
we're not the spending done yet but it's
something that maybe we'll be able to do
for the website so we're just having fun
with it trying to make it fun and fresh
being the site I'm just going to bring
you along on what we're really doing
today one thing the site's missing is
like the top banner you go to any nice
website there's a top banner of some
sort we're going to try to create one
right now in front of this really cool
wall and they're going to basically
throw my products at me like that's just
like toss them at me we're going to
start capturing in the air I don't know
you guys can decide if it's cool
yes all right Raina's later
you know it's gog Shh you're an animal
with that an animal with that camera man
one of my favorite photographers though
for really you need to take such good
photos takes me like you make me look
better than I actually look cuz means
I'm gonna be up till 4:00 a.m. looking
haystack is that what I'm supposed to do
that's the move this is yours behind the
scenes of building one picture for the
website and I had a skill look but it
it's a good start
Thank You clay boy yo this one made it
really far I even know what was
happening so come to fetch and we all
smiled viewers from your last minutes

website will be up by the time you're

want to do this project before it gets
too late
some headed over now let's do it it can
be ridiculous
alright back home by the way you did not
see yesterday's vlog check it out it's
honestly one of my favorite vlogs in a
long time I built the RC plane and it
was just a blast I love just check it
out if you didn't see it and the other
cool thing is I bought all these extra
plane foam plane because I thought I'd
break that one so we got all these cool
planes left extras ready aim oh my gosh
that came back to me boomerang a
boomerang Boeing yeah here's what I'm
talking about we got a serious eyesore
here at the house I mean a real eyesore
but you better watch flash he will
snatch that plane up actual respect I
suppose I'm not talking about the siding
that's popping out of the house like
that I'm not talking about the rug
that's falling apart I'm talking about
under the porch that flashes destroyed
these aren't the eyesores I'm talking
about the I swear I'm talking about is
right here
this swing who I've offered to everybody
in the family Britney's mom said no
don't get rid of it because I want it
I'm going to take it this is a year ago
and I keep asking and nobody takes the
swing so today I I'm going to personally
remove this swing what do you think
donkey are you in are you in or out in
bar come on give me something he's a
flying talking donkey I had a lot of
thoughts in my head how do I get rid of
this swing right because it's oh look
the wood is pop it's bowing it's bowing
like a quarter pipe come on what you
think you enter you out you enter yup I
need something something maybe one be
broke if you didn't mess around in there
huh
were you doing anyway what's in it you
have to be in there hey just the person
I'm looking for
welcome welcome I um I need you to help
me
got a removal issue I got a removable
super-good I already know what you're
going to say so just need you to help me
just agree yes you're going to help me
just say yes you're going to help me
you're already thinking it you want to
say it
1 2 3 yeah yeah perfect so here's the
thing here's the deal here's the real
issue Brit look she's already distracted
you're supposed to be helping me
Oh make him talk look at the belly look
at the belly do you know you're a
witness
I've offered this to everybody this
chair this has got to go it hurts your
mom has been saying she's taking it for
a year four times up over plow
bumblebees and don't zombies got places
to live baby then each day feels good
so I've an idea just take apart yeah
I'll get some tools in to take up that's
probably what I should do with it but I
need you to follow me because I need you
to hold this camera while I get some
things ready know what what now I lost
that thing ages ago
wait the Bobcat yeah I found the Bobcat
not well yes I am identity cuz we need
something to move to swing and I can't
move it I think you're not flat back
backs problems baby ministy MS I will
show you but I'll rip my shirt that's a
nice shirt you got on there won't worry
those if I use that swing to actually
hold the trampoline like we have ropes
tied to that swing to cut the rope dog
already did it without you even knowing
with your pink your cake I know I'm not
gonna stick in that chef Alina that
thing is going to be like a tight old
storm spoon so can't you just leave this
thing okay
I'm still pretty muddy okay I think you
know I just looked really uses I am at
the fork
what do you think
which have I just pulled out for all the
couples markets Johan so this sign was
left here when we bought the places and
I was really how old it is it is falling
apart but therefore it's not too bad
let's do one last fling so I'll hit the
ground
yeah the bumble bees have drilled holes
in it
so all kinds of the big bumble bee nest
seemed upset
or the trampoline
it's gonna fall apart before he even
gets it I don't know if I thought this
one through yo I could balance it we
could swing on it up in the air wait so
what are you doing with it I'm going to
hand-deliver it to your mom's house I'm
going to take it out there and destroy
it you'll enjoy that chair
this is probably the first time you sat
on that thing forever okay there's some
crazy thundering happening over here
like it's about the boom well since
we're about to get stormed on I got to
make this quick here's the idea I want
to basically catch this thing on fire
burning that's the best way to get rid
of old wood right you just catch it on
fuck nice camera baby you look good with
that camera dang heavy
yeah sources must don't worry for sure
we're gonna burn this thing and the idea
that it goes away forever done nothing
changing Oh we'll get to change wait so
you're not using the flamethrower i
parodied flame throw it yeah it's
probably the better idea but I blamed it
I want to I want to kind of saturate it
in gas and then light it so the whole
chair is on fire right but not the not
the part you sit on so maybe I get a
cool pictures oh that is not what I was
thinking you were doing I thought you
were literally just lighting it on fire
well essentially that's going to happen
guys that is that is what's going to
happen but maybe get a picture before we
call it quits on the old the old chair
okay here's my idea
why would you smell that let's ripped up
oh my gosh that looks so dangerous just
keep standing on that looks dangerous
how much gas it's a real problem oh
honey you got gas all day the top is
really what I'm worried about
gotta go up there though but it's going
to go on the bottom too I don't think
it's gonna like that huh oh yeah maybe
it will work
oh okay that's cool and I'll sit in it
it's hot it's not that cool oh my
boyfriend so silly don't lie you're are
those your new shoes what do you do baby
my happy with that yes I'm embarrassed
so that is supposed to be a fire like a
like a tote like a big old boom like a
little Patek weird like a spray or
something like a squirt squirt squirt
remember you're helping me here so I can
- like a like money places like a mr.
that I can literally safely spray it
yeah let's go get it pink yes we're
gonna win that bottle I got spray all
look this one's empty that's at work
right if I only had a brain
finally thought of this in the first
place this would have safely sprayed the
place exactly where I wanted it I don't
know why I feel like I have to do this
but don't try this at home shit don't
try this at all don't try this at
anybody's home this is just me being me
don't be me this Thunder this under is
about to be bad that's why you don't put
gas in a plastic cup it just melts it
completely that's dink
wait is that even going to catch it on
fire you ever heard the song can't stuff
about a fire without a flame there's no
flame just smoke it could be hot I ain't
gonna catch on fire yeah this needs to
go
it looks so innocent don't try this at
home without what you're trying to say I
said that I already said it but like it
looks like so nice
for them it's not angry mad at me all
that Depok will get all the fall
oh wait now I think this is your biggest
sale yet I can't even put a chip on fire
oh really course oh my gosh
you should I like a big pina colada in
your hands or something like a big
coconut lame
Elaine's blames the lame flame are you
mad
so mad just never seen that never been
mad at me ever
