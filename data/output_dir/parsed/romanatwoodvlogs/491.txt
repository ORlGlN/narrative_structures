repetitive and I needed to just call it
so today we're just going to rob our
hope you guys enjoy it let's get started
let's have some fun in Miami and
see some chicken a walk we have a day
off tomorrow
we're traveling into Georgia Atlanta
Georgia we have a show in Atlanta two
days everyone just said what can we do
in Atlanta we want to do something that
will blow your mind
Atlanta has the biggest aquarium in the
country and you can scuba dive with the
sharks
you know I'm scared water - my biggest
fear that's why you get you can get past
it right now I'll panic in the water and
they'll eat me they won't eat you
they like dark meat hucking scuba-dive
with my rush you guys know I love diving
and I love scuba diving with sharks
dude I'll block you and if anything
happens I'll send it the world's are
it's safe people do it every day hey
just so you know I can't save you from a
shark bodyguards hey man I mean uh I'll
try but I'm out too hard because I can
get up alright that's at least one idea
we said what can we do in Atlanta we
have a day off in Atlanta tomorrow what
can we do I'm 110% down a shark guy you
won't do it you would owe this down for
something like that I'm not no you know
why you're not down
because you let your mind feel you're in
fear nothing is going to happen to you
in fact when you're done with it you're
going to be so happy even if you said
jump in water with Nemo and nori I went
into it
memo's are one of the most deadly
efficiently world yeah exactly
I'm kidding at least that's I do my idea
out there then you should do one thing
that scares you every day that's all
think about I'll think about it okay two
hundred two hundred thousand likes and
you have to die they'll get that in 30
minutes
three hundred I don't think I've ever
had $300 hundred thousand four hundred
net semarang a thousand four hundred
thousand likes because I know that's
ridiculous four hundred thousand likes
my time we get your land a pussy has to
should be illegal you'll never see a
happier DJ right here man
this is his day hope you guys enjoy a
more of a wall block today I'm just
gonna film on a shoot as much videos I
can and guys today what is this sir
cornbread
that's my cornbread yes your cornbread
turn out do you put the syrup on the
chicken experiment you know everyone
just everywhere just
dumping it all over all right you guys
know I love syrup on all my sausage
bacon I never try to uncheck them I
think it makes sense butter biscuits
chicken waffles cornbread you name it
this is the south as you get and it's
delicious I'm either gonna go pass out
and miss my show sit on the toilet for
two hours I'm gonna be really happy
they're all up for grabs right now what
are these like I'm almost popular
dessert here Oh maple glazed bacon
doughnuts
thank God he said bacon I can't try it
we're all so funny said we got a special
treat in you guys so here we go can't
walk yuck
carry me you got this yes carry me Levi
oh we are out of there I have never
experienced chicken and waffles and I'm
not sure that if I do again it will ever
be that good that was insane if you've
never had the highly recommended where
was that place out Yardbird
I can scan for you
oh he's got a smile more shirt on Miami
feeling the heat Will Smith baby we are
running back to the hotel grabbing a
couple things and then it is off to the
show me Reid's live show Miami and other
fun things Britney's making a little
video for you guys today so I'll be
playing that and just seen checking in
at home check-in you know I now know why
they do chicken and waffles because the
chicken put you in like a sleepy coma
and the waffles light you up with the
syrup so I'm liking this weird funky mix
of hyper and sleepy
alright so I'm back at my hotel and get
some things together and I'm on it I
want to show you guys what I really
didn't show you if you guys watched the
last video I uploaded then you know I
broke my hand and I really didn't show
you guys the details of it and I don't
want to and I really don't want to get
into the details of it but if you watch
the video I explained that I have a
broken hand and when I get back to Ohio
they have to rebuy kit and put me in a
cast or a splint or however they want to
handle it but I never showed you guys
this is my hand right now these are all
pretty normal but these right here this
knuckle is what they call a boxer's
fracture and you can see my knuckle is
gone and actually push down and crooked
which is why if you look at my hand
right now I have no knuckle you see this
hand this hand has a big knuckle and
that's actually because my knuckle has
been pushed back into this area and
there's a fracture inside of it see I
guess that's pretty much the details of
it and it's not fun man I want to thank
everybody for listening to my story and
the vlogger I uploaded about how I broke
my hand and it's just it's really
embarrassing to me and I got nothing but
love for you guys so thank you from the
bottom of my heart for being here let's
continue this vlog let's go I know
everyone's gonna be out here waiting
I'll sit it's so hard to use my hand oh
you ready
window you chicken
how try to hit my hand on everything are
you ready

B what's up Bob what you ready for

noticed as much as I have but Miami is

seriousness this is small more show

mock in here yeah but where's the deep
voice uh hey I did it yesterday they use
things like can you bring it out for me
right now for the vlog right now for the
wall there it is gentlemen we go dark in
13 minutes so if we could please lower
our microphones on and proceed with the
soundcheck
that just made it so much fun or for me
you guys may or may not know soundcheck
is actually really boring it's basically
where we just check our mics and we
always try to make fun
ways to make it fun so this is our mics
we wear every single night you guys seen
these they're very irritating because
they always move like all you guys will
see if you come to the show I'm always
moving them and playing with it playing
with ya and it's only upside down to us
the audience season all right I got you
I got you usually at the shows he has
smile more going all over the venue
tonight he just wants to hold it right
down that white spot I think what's
great so why do you even listen because
the crowds are so loud but it starts
feeding back into your microphone and
then we can't turn you up above the
crowds yes you guys are like back to the
future we're playing again yeah exactly
like that like I said I don't I don't
get along with these mics very well

popular part of here this will be the
most popular absolutely just some random

nervous where we at with Roger house
sriracha pote lake style but it's like
more I think Chinese which I love I'm a
big fan they're making it right here all
right okay basically it's like an Asian
Chipotle you choose from all these
things you pick you're like what you
want noodles or rice your your kind of
meet your sauce I don't know what to get
yet we get some spicy though no good
no imma be completely honest two species
idea to come here at wholly regret this
this is like this research giving Hughes
unbelievable it's so good Oh is he
really gonna disrespect him like I was
even pull out my camera clothes just
eating talking he was like you haven't
been talking I've just been eating it's
amazing yeah Pablo I got a challenge for
you
after that cringey rap tonight yeah
have you ever snorted sriracha just one
drop what we give it one drop you tell
me anybody ever done that give course
yeah okay just one drop look at the
result
usually smiles happen
Oh often say don't honey
someone's got to do it the freedom sinus
as well one wrong you don't to do that
nor do you have to do all that I just
gave you enough anything Roman knows
what happened so he wants to see what's
going to happen with you
so it might not be bad at all
you don't do it tomorrow for
armwrestling you got a hard-on for me
country it's a fight you guys okay with
sriracha is it's hot chili sauce and uh
I mean you eat it it's not that spicy or
drowsiness and my mouth is like really
it's not burning but it's tingling
hey God you're gonna do it if you give
me I'll stick to the deal I will stick
to the deal if you do it hundred percent
yeah
yo success requires sacrifice I'll
sacrifice my fame let's go alright I
draw the line
yeah how makes a line gonna be what
nother thing you ready good you don't
have to clear it but that's enough to
get it in which one's working versus
stepping up to the plate guys I'm
impressed he's doing it for a reason if
he doesn't I'm gonna tell you what the
reason like the next thing I'm gonna
steal and be in the hospital no no I
