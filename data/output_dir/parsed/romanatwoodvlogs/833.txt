hey guys what's up before this vlog
starts you may notice that this vlogs a
little weird there's no intro
there's no outro that is because I today
lost my freakin computer lost it so I
had to edit this vlog on a computer I've
never used before with no editing
software and it's probably gonna suck a
little bit hope you guys understand
wish me luck on get my computer back and
try to enjoy this vlog without any fancy
stuff
love you guys what's up my friends we
are on the move this morning packing our
bags and we're packing headed for our
next adventure of the week I don't know
we're probably forgetting everything I
can't believe I leave my fan no nobody's
gonna pick that up maybe we leave the
fan they would want it like a double win
no I'm not be kind of fun if we had time
our car is waiting for us downstairs
yeah we're late okay
we're always late oh just found clothes
in the bathroom
walking out see you're like losing our
minds here I don't know I think we're
good been a really fun nice stay in Los
Angeles but we're off to a new city
today new places new people we are
headed to Texas today have you ever been
to Texas no first time I've I haven't
been the Texas Prince 2006 that's a long
time ago I don't even remember it I know
it's hot there's a pool table in the
middle of the hotel it's cool
oh my god you keep when yeah let me
check my pants I can't find my wallet
such a bad problem you ready
the busy busy lax this airport is crazy
okay we made it to the airport guys I
never thought in my life I'd be flying
to LA to be staying in a big fancy hotel
having a limo service pick us up never
thought in a million years and I'm not
saying that to sound cocky or I just
want to I want to use that as
inspiration to you guys three years ago
I couldn't even afford a plane ticket to
Los Angeles it was impossible
so I think that all this comes out of
love and not money you don't do it for
money I did this out of love a passion
of hobby and
and money becomes the byproduct of what
you love I promise you don't do it for
money it'll happen
and then you get to a point where
companies need write-offs taxes write
offs they need it they got to spend
money so they blow it on you it's a
win-win we're out why are you bringing
pizza on a plane that's gonna drive
everyone nuts
everyone hungry even the smoke eats a
rolling through the air plan
stop
this is a much bigger plane than what
we're used to center seats these are
nice and you can put stuff under here or
maybe I've never been on a plane with a
recliner and I guess this reclines super
floor and I'm just now posting in
today's vlog on the plane crazy
everywhere we go anything we do I mean
it's not that physically hot but
mentally it is nice mentally it's
exhausting up all night editing every
night and should have to get it up and
ready before we get on
