obviously besides being with you guys
all week is the shark dive yeah dang
it's gonna be hard to beat that period
without being eaten without me anything
how do you beat that how's it been
beaten I'll tell you what my favorite
part about it is not being on the
shortcut no you would have loved it
anybody that's afraid to do that I would
say challenge yourself and take the jump
because it is your mind blowing
I've got to tell you if like you me and
Dale would have pulled a boat up out
there by ourselves by ourselves never
would open that water you would have
seen us
hop in that boat so fast the first time
you seen a run on water
so on the comfort of your instructor
that's what makes a good instructor he
guides you and shows you and you follow
him right through the trip visit alright
