room boy okay so here's the deal you
guys probably remember when roasts
yourself challenge was huge on YouTube a
lot of the big you to utmost of the
internet made a roast yourself challenge
well I never did it but here's the thing
I actually did write a couple verses but
I saved it for my tour I never actually
did it on YouTube so you guys have been
asking me so many times to just just do
it do what you did on tour on the vlog
so I'm just going to do it tonight but
we're going to make it funny we're going
to make like a little rap video sail
just has of course this crazy light that
makes our swim trunks glow
giving the others but this is my rosh to
yourself little video all right I'm
going to try this first try but none
this is for you got to cut it up like
when we were on tour I would come out on
stage as V for vanilla it was my rapper
name and it was like I was supposed to
be not Roman I wasn't supposed to be me
and I was roasting Roman so that's how
I'm going to do this
alright guys remember this is V for
vanilla not roaming out when I'm going
to roast Roman out Celeste I can't here
we go I've been under some sort I know
it's been a while this is for you guys
okay
I think that tonight's a great night to
start a fight with a man we don't like
most of you know them is roaming in that
little doors right here all night so sit
back relax and preheat to 400 because
I'm going to stalk this road you think
that I'm playing and making this funny
but I mean a cousin gets broke I want to
start like and go into this fight so he
doesn't go running away although if he
does we can all change our challenge
forever to our greatest day romans
Eleuthera fixes the humor just google
his name you'll see pictures of tumors
to different kids from two different
mothers nobody like woman not even his
brother or fail his vlog suck hope he
gets hit with a Mack truck maybe get
cursing some bad luck but no keep
watching his video money he'll blow on a
kid keep making him think that you
actually love them because these down
inside we all know he is nothing and
then there would be like a pause and
everyone would be like mad at me for
making fun of Roman good to see me and
then I'd hit him with this I'd hidden
with the last one I go the fact that he
made it on YouTube using nothing but
pics of his girls boom and then and then
and then I go and then I jump and then I
go everyone saying is prank so fake but
I just can't handle his crazy clickbait
oh and then the base was dropped and the
lights would drop and it is better live
I'm sure many good day maybe it was it
was pretty good all right so that's the
ocean all right nailed it you're out out
baby can't get hot right you sure you
don't want hang with vp4 vanilla you
want hang out how would you feel vanilla
ha ha I didn't say for now like girl so
there you have it guys that was
something that I did on tour and it was
it was actually right when roaster
self-challenge was popular and I just
threw that together in last second for
the tour and I was like I could be this
different character that rose throwing
so long story but if you were there you
get it I feel like you get more respect
