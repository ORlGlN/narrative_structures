bounced out now the kids are mad at

same deal no not purposely I could never
plant it that good two times I was close
that was what half-mile shot what time
you get your real teeth your bill to hit
it oh oh oh hold on that's pretty strong
because I was able to hold on to the rim
all of us in his legs don't hurt so that
is going to do it for today I've kind of
worked past uh bedtimes and things like
that and I just hope that today I tried
to I don't know if you could tell the
vlogs not crazy long
but it was more raw and the clips were
way longer than usual I kind of kept it
rolling and just you know I kind of just
went with it maybe a little more your
style I know you guys like that so I
tried to do a little bit better today
and I just switch it up these are
actually the types of logs that I enjoy
the most to because it's just like real
life and it's like what my kids are
actually doing and it's just really cool
I like that style so thank you
let me know what you think of a vlog
where the clips are longer instead of
cut so quick thanks for hanging out with
