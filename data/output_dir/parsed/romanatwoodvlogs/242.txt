difference it's just the roof of my car
oh maybe maybe we thought he meant
diapers adult diapers oh maybe we love
that he's of course you know his other
buddies going to do that already I bet I
don't know if anyone's x-ray we don't
even need to buy it you there's a binky
on the floor
sweet it's afraid that's a free binky is
a Frankie area but that that's on
Frankie you also created a funbox diaper
30 bucks 30 dollars that for a hundred
and 20 for diapers you know they're just
trying to help us and you know any
anything that's a commodity they know
you have to have it's going to be jacked
out it's going to be more expensive like
like tennis shoes man but there's always
the cheap brand we could go cheap but I
asked John what kind of diapers they
like because they have a kid and you do
find your favorite diaper so you have
your favorites I do
pampers in my experience are the
absolute best for fit okay well it's
funny because he did say he doesn't like
Huggies oops I just said it ah two
full-grown men talking about the the
science of diapers and brand quality
braces yeah yeah right this is this is
dad time right now I'm going full dad

rocking it actually pretty respectable
ya know it's like yeah they make a nice
now apparently it's a dumb joke but we
gotta go pack of diapers like it's a
guy's diaper party right
so giving the girls diapers not the guy

better I don't know I feel like we get
him a big dude you know if one day I
