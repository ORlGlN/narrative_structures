welcome to the vlog guys today we are
going over to basically three weeks ago
roughly I told you guys I started a new
tree service basically you call me I
come to your house I remove your tree a
lot of you thought I was joking a lot of
you thought I was serious today we were
back for round two and I brought and
hired some new employees I got a brother
Dale highly highly recommending the tree
service he's gotten a very good resume
well trained my father who has taught us
everything we know about tree says I
look at the tree I see how I'm gonna
sold it and I make sure it gets taken
down right and then we got country mr.
candy man himself welcome to the vlog
guys hope you're having a great day
we're going over for round two last time
the tree one it is tree one human zero
let's do this alright man I brought some
of my best employees today so this
should be the this should be it round
two I don't know these guys look kind of
smaller did you get the van fixed yeah I
gotta fix it sitting out front you don't
want to pull it back here no see here's
here's the problem with the tree like
this since it died standing up it's had
time to actually like petrify now it's
not going to turn to stone but all the
water's gonna come out and it's going to
be stone hard so it's gonna make it
really hard to take down it is hard as
we know it's cured so this sucker is
dead man it's an old dead monster of a
tree so this is from the last attempt
that's true you can see we put a hurtin
on it but it is still standing there
right no firecracker gonna take this
thing down that vine right there that's
poison ivy oh yeah
it's about Dale you guys know my
brother's the brains of the operation
how you feeling there what are you
thinking you know the big tree big it's
hard to tell on camera how big it is
it's dangerous it's dangerous is part
enough something want to stand around
for long you really think we can take it
down I don't know I don't want to be a
doubting Thomas here but I think we got
this we may need the saw extender
separator country we need you to go
behind the barn and get the stall
extender separator okay
pretty big you'll see it actually
stretches the blade helps us cut holes
keep it sharp yeah yeah just right
behind the barn it's a big tree get the
blade stretcher
there is no plane stretching he's he's
the apprentice right now you don't know
anything about tree work so I'm gonna
send them on a wild goose yeah it's
Becker you'll know what it is when you
see it some start building a little heat
out here picked on the coldest days of
the year for true telling' degrees out
here right now feels like Hawaii all
right guys this time I brought a lot of
cameras lots of GoPros just extra stuff
last time I only brought this camera so
I know extra footage no extra angles
this time should be fun I hope you're
ready this is something we've been
wanting to get rid of for a while and
this is round 2 if you watch this
channel and you're not subscribed please

us we upload everyday at least we try to
let's get this tree now man who thinks
right now don't skip to the end who
thinks we're gonna get this tree down
everybody's skeptical my dad's like and
I'm like oh it's way bigger on camera
than it looks and I'm just worried that
it's not gonna come down so here we go
put in your votes comment now before you
finish the vlog is the tree gonna go
down we're not wasting no time everybody
ears on eyes on let's go alright these
are special anti tree rounds we loaded
up in this baby custom hand loaded they
have miniature saw blades packed behind
the bullet yeah what Dale just said
we've got custom basically little chain
saws I thought those were carved from
beaver teeth say yeah oh we did bring
the beaver teeth round yeah basically
hit lien alright where is country he
should have had that if we just had that
treated stretch are we eating it you
know good helps hard to fun oh there
he's still behind the bar I would stand
back
Wow did you see that that is too
dangerous man you see those chumps jeez

past I told you ha ha ha holy smokes oh
my god there's our - holy crap look at
that that did some damage that's new
wood right there that crank right there
look it's all the way oh my gosh you see
all the snow coming down it was sweet
feeling pretty confident about this
right now at least Dale's gonna take
this next shot we're moving back because
it's throwing chunks of wood really big
at us you put that dot on it it hits
it's gonna be a big one I promise y'all
my GoPro survived I put a GoPro right
here
nice shootin my told you when you hire
the best you get the best it's in
chainsaw bullets ya thought that was
gonna take a lot longer than that oh my
gosh
yeah plenty more dead trees yeah I can't
believe that just went down like that
dude I thought it was all hollow that
wasn't even hollow that's solid yeah
hello down there it took off like a
rocket ship look at this dude nobody put
that there that is fresh fallen spikes
do these chunks everywhere look how hard
it threw these pieces of wood all my try
to pick it up

blur cross the road 40 pound 50 60 70
hundred and 150 baby
what was that 20 pounds country with
what do you want to do with this I'm
gonna make how many of toothpicks out of
this if you want to got the chain
stretcher that probably wouldn't happen
man I'm sorry I'm still looking for what
is the Train what is this I don't know
what it is just keep looking boss keep
looking at the chain the chain structure
you cut it and then you just make it
longer you actually special tool up
there behind that but everybody knows
what it is look on the surface that's a
nice wood though wow look at the marks
it's amazing it like it like it turned
it into just yet roll it just turned it
