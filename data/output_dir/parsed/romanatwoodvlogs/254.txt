cool about this is that it's numbered so
this is number 72 of the 500 i we made
one I actually didn't we have cars that
come in though you guys don't know
Brittany's dad you should know her dead
collectibles and Hot Wheels
he has walls kind of like this in his
house and they're giving him like a rare
collectible that is so sweet guys thank
you thank you guys -
is not LAN losses why what's this one -
what's this 100 yeah so they've asked us
to sign their wall but this wallet which
you're pretty tight there's no way I can
make anything look as good as this you
think you can do a really nice smile on
their there you go
so no pressure except for like a ton and
I know first of all it's forever the
heart the ours only he is going to be
like we're gonna run on a real game you
guys you gotta smell it make sure you do
all caps don't do one little lower case
oh gosh can you do it you can do it
you're right I should have done it on
wrong it's gonna go behind the pictures
yeah we're on the board we're on the
board
okay we're never getting Cain out of
here okay can you want to stay the night
here he's going to drain the whole
bucket all to one up they're all fast
whoa okay that was awesome
what is it it's at one way at would way
this is the way that was go parently
that's where it turns out first of all
amazing time Cain did you have a good
time it was really they hooked you up
they hooked us up with so much stuff
that was that was by far one of the most
laid back and fun
I mean if I didn't even appeared to be a
meeting on camera but it was really fun
to meet with a brand that we have
passionate but it's like something up
with me in Lauderdale as kids playing
with Hot Wheels in the dirt
now me and Caine play with Hot Wheels in
the dirt this is something so cool to be
able to walk in and have a connection
like that as youtubers it's easy to get
a brand the 8 you get a brand deal I'll
take it I'm going to put it in the vlog
for us lately we've been trying to find
brand deals we're very passionate about
products that we love and that we know
you will love although we have no deal
without wheels and we never have it was
fun very fun to meet the company and
talk about future potential and I really
think there's a connection they are
family-friendly fun products it just
seems so natural for us to work with
that kind of company I have no idea
what's going to happen I I would assume
that if something happens it's only
going to be like what if I did a lifting
move what if I did the Hot Wheels Larry
some of that even I love Ellen wheel
yeah so obviously we don't know what it
is guys but when I talk about trying to
bring you along on what we do off-camera
this was the coolest version of that
that was really cool and in the first
meeting I've ever brought in came to
which was really
thank you to all kinds of somebody
beautiful Hot Wheels sticker where do
you want to put that thickening of my
four-wheeler
oh really yes computer we have to put it
on it yeah so who knows spun I want to
bring you guys along on so much and just
be honest with you guys brand and deals
are part of a youtubers career if you
notice 2017 not a single brand deal we
haven't done a single Bramblett right
nothing and that is because we're
focusing on things we're passionate
about and not just really deal just
because we will make X amount of money
on it has to be something we love and
something that we assume the majority of
our audience will love as well so I
think there's a fit here but who knows I
don't know what's going to happen we
hope that some people come out yeah
we're going to put into play without
their consent woman so now that that
little speech is over we are going to
actually have to return this car and
they close and we have to try to get
there pretty close
we turn it I have one more thing I got
to do today which unfortunately is going
to be off-camera and then we are out of
LA by the time you're watching this
actually we're already gone we're
probably home
all of my data watch was law they can't
see this launch they gave they gave her
dad this collector's box number 170
sanity number 72 a million eight five
hundred of these and they gave him
number 72 so he's going to let me love
this color like like lotion on I think
it's because there are so many birthdays

like money so I just went and bought
like five hot wheel cars and that's like
your purse perfectly lovely yeah I mean
