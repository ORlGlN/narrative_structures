driveway is murdered look at this hey
little gamers we got to mud wrestle do
you want to play in the mud yeah what do
you mean there's so much mud Noah would
you get in the mud with me tonight
tomorrow I don't know
really there's one come on we could do
we could do a um welcome to Ohio funny
picture this is always muddy and rainy
and cornfield Ian let's see no no not
this mud this is special mod this is
that non stink my nonstick my daddy is
stick to you there's so much that we got
to do something with it
our C cars like we got to do something
with it
the our C's are fully waterproof we can
just mud run them mm-hmm it's my mom my
brother kids family just showed up and
my mom's making waffles yeah pancakes
ask her where she got the maple syrup
hey mom where'd you get the maple syrup
I can't get out of the trees you made it
we did how did you make it was much I
wanted to make it and your dad put
everything together and he helped me I
made it happen
yeah we drilled them tree I have no idea
how you make maple syrup but I have seen
I've seen a house with like a hundred
buckets tied around a tree that was us
that was us that wasn't you yeah I've
never seen Holly we only had nine
buckets I actually had nine buckets we
did like it was like 38 gallons of sap
boiled down to one gallon so when you
hear of a maple tree no that's how you
make it sugar maybe yeah so you drill a
hole in it just wait for it to pour out
yeah I guess we just drilled a hole in
the tree with its with a real it's
called a spire and you drive the spire
in and you hook a hose to it down to our
bucket and you just wait I know somebody
watching right now makes their own maple
syrup you guys know exactly what these
fariq's are talking about I need a plate
I need a plate of those Roman wait wait
paper plate honey growing out of paper
play oh hey we're gonna have to get a
styrofoam plate
hang on let me get some clean dishes we
don't you have dishes here's what we've
discovered through all of this
is that you should eat pancakes with
bowls because the syrup runs in the
middle instead of away from the pancake
makes it like this let's go backwards
that's awesome
houses me right now how's those
pancakes how's the syrup that's been
strong is it everything you dreamed up
it's better that's what I thought even
the stuff you buy in the store they
don't they don't cook it down as far so
they get more gallons per SAP so it's
runny ER and not as rich 40 gallons made
one gallon so yeah pretty much
are you serious
is this finger really stuck next you
can't pull it out this show hopefully
it's not my way says hi grandma he came
over talking to me and then he says he's
so calm about it he says my hand is
stuck and I went well hold on don't hold
on him that's one of my greatest fears
is getting stuck in something just a
little just a little harder he's so calm
we will that's so good
is that full water yeah it's got water
in it
it's totally seasoned oh no water coming
out the bog
cannot make this up Conrad's finger is
stuck in this cup holder you got screws
let's just take this off that's not
gonna hook well am I good take it off
take it off yeah got it
you really plugged it up boy y'alright
this house he doesn't think dangerous
who puts cupholders out all right guys
we need your help my dad has come up
with this idea to launch this balloon
into the air with some type of reward on
it if you guys find it one of you guys
somehow find this balloon you get this
big reward right yeah really cool huh
maybe more than one balloon and see how
far we can get them okay but here's what
it's turned into you can buy little
tracking GPS units with a service plan
and everything to put into a balloon and
then we can watch daily on the vlogs
where this balloon is right yeah plus a
reward plus we found it you get to track
no no also we'll know about where it
lands so if you're in that vicinity and
nobody finds it I'll be able to help you
could like treasure on it because I
think like we can get pretty close with
the GPS on so here's what we need to
know is this the stupidest thing you've
ever heard keep in mind the tracker that
we will lose unless somebody ships it
back is $400 now that now that suckers
are 400 bucks no no if you want a live
track on a computer you have to have a
service plan you have to activate it's a
whole thing so we'd have to rely on you
guys to actually return it or you know
well I mean if we're going to go into it
you have to just pretend it's going the
tracker that's very if that's what you
get if we lose it we lose it but if
someone can actually find it which I
think we can paint fun we just looked up
helium balloons a regular helium balloon
like this can travel thousands of miles
like you can leave the country I know it
sounds crazy are you guys in that's the
question
here's the bummer of it with the current
selection of GPS it'll take three 24
inch balloons to
one tracker what one 36 inch balloon
fully fill to lift one two three foot
Louie 331 so we can get this far we need
to find a small tracker and what's that
what's the laws like are we gonna hit
airplanes and uh let's see
no I just checked off well yeah no
visual laws
so guys television today will see you if
somebody's gonna come after us for this
tell us what you think is it the dumbest
thing you've ever heard or should we
send up a tracker
it's a searchin fine by the way tomorrow
roaming there's going to be four
thousand balloons flying in this guy and
you're gonna be out of this game should
we do it or not
you gotta ask super dad they're funny
really so here's the deal Romans been
acting like Todd's went on the pinball
machine doesn't bother him but every
minute tonight that we aren't watching
you know he wants it bad he's after it
Hey say bye Hey go give Dale go give
Dale big hug you want me to do it I'll
hold your hand
he's so antsy sure oh that's not so bad
all right that's it ah you fell for that
again I got you kid you knew he'd tickle
you high five too slow see you later
love you coming over I only see you guys
oh these are my balls now
oh four balls good job honey
it's fun it's such a good mental
exercise sorry these marbles now this is
like what yay

in the future oh so close one hand only
yeah good so cute
can you are look we have a whole drawer
full the lack is useless look if you've
been with this channel long time you
guys know I actually love watching
jugglers like they are so fascinating
because it's so hard I thought the best
that I can do and that I've learned is
for balls like and and that's like the
beginner for jugglers I don't know I
love for you makes you really happy like
it when I juggle clears your mind I
think I'll tell you this juggling makes
me full-on sweat it's like a mental
thing yeah it makes me sweat drain
exercise it is dude your room looks
awesome just clean it you did a good job
so what do you think you just getting
the hang of it
not really you're probably gonna call me
the biggest nerd ever but growing up one
of my favorite games to date still its
commanding conquer generals zero an hour
it's an old game like it's been hectic
even getting it to work on the computers
but I think knowing I are gonna have so
much fun with this game it's an old
strategy game it's a war game you build
you build your army and you attack the
other armies and it's old I don't the
online servers aren't don't even exist
anymore so it's it's like a local game
we can play per computer the reason I'm
so excited is I want Noah to love it so
that him and I can
or beyond teens or stuff like that
machine gun and oh my gosh can you just
that's crazy
that's cool even have to click that and
then you can click anywhere you want and
that's where your guy will go he's he's
done being built alright guys thank you
