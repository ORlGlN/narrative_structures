can't help but stop and check out some
of the surf spots it's this place called
cookie PHA this is pretty man
famous windsurfing spot famous parking
spot right here
this road right here runs for 30 miles
and it's the most winding narrow
mountain hill you've ever seen like it
it's crazy it's just enough room for one
car so this is the road on the map it
literally looks like scribbles just like
Kane drew it do you think of this
pretty crazy down here what they said we
should have shoes we're wearing
flip-flops whoa we just pulled over on
the side of the road there's a bunch of
people it's like a bamboo forest you

wild than this so everybody told us take
two days to get the Hama because you're
going to want to stop and see everything
on the way we're like now we can do it
and I'm starting to think that we're
going to be stuck in Hana tonight
because there's just too much cool stuff
to look at

lunch gonna ride a bike this place is
saving the day they got the hot chili

bro thanks do remember the name of these
trails we're on a two mile two mile hike
up all uphill it's pretty intense for us
we're definitely not in shape as much as
we should be for hiking but it's a good
challenge
we started this hike we start walking
high to go back to the car cuz I was
like maybe I should grab an extra
battery sure enough it just started
flashing red like this trail
it's amazing this is the kind of Sun you
don't want to see fatal drop whoo
you know you're high when you can't see
the bottom it's somewhere down there do
not enter fatalities have occurred class

Banyan Banyan yes and its massive and
its massive dude good stand by Brit so

have a decision to make
there's there's some fall pools point
are you going you already made it okay
it's another half mile down we got to
come back out it's not that bad right
and do anything else let's do it
I love it I'm addicted to the waves
making I have these at the house
I got to live somewhere like this so
this is the pools and normally I think
there's more water here you can see how
low it is
is it like the 7-6
yes yeah they're seven total these must
be the bottom three on two three school
have you ever seen black sand
what you got to say about this it's
breathtaking
alright guys I have a confession to make
we're not actually on planet Earth we
flew to another planet and we're living
the dream we're never going back
so this is our first time seeing blacks
and I've heard of it it's love a rock
all right this one's for my mom mom if
you're watching we found you a beautiful
rock and I wanted to put it in the blog
because I know you collect rocks all
over the world and I wanted you to see
where we got it so this is it
yeah we just picked it up it washed up
to our feet so I'll bring it home to you
I love you oh so beautiful
I gotta get a shot of this play this oh
oh my god
I can't make that up I can't make that
up like I'm trying to tell you a story
right now
Who am I my mind's been blown okay so
here's the part I'm confused about we're
here and this is what we're going across
and it says unpaved Road rental cards
not covered the guardrail is so secure
it's not funny let's go this is all net
up here you can even see from the
falling rocks oh my god look so this is
a crazy the craziest road I've ever
driven on in my life this is you're
literally on the edge of the cliff yeah
but there's a guard rail here yeah well
not here
online cues it's really pretty I don't
think it'd be as bad here in the day
guys I hope we make it back to our hotel
is it blurry it just keeps getting
better
it's a
it's an hour of rock and dirt and off
one side is a cliff as high as you can
see the other sides of mountain oh she
could actually smile more penny
translator oh yeah they'll see it did
you really not have it and drive the
entire time we were driving right but
you had it in low or something what did
you have it in it was just in like you
didn't go manual oh so it was literally
just staying in first year just oh it
feels so good to be on solid ground what
a freaking trip dude there's no way I
can even there's no way I can translate
even through this vlog what we just went
through to get here
unbelievable that was the craziest ride

road to Hana it's scary scare you to
death just found this little diner down
