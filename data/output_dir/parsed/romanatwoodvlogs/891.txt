what's up my friends it is absolutely
breathtaking today we've just arrived to
a little place called Paradise Cove I
don't think it's hard to figure out why
it's named Paradise Cove supposed to be
one of the greatest snorkeling spots on
the island in fact behind these islands
I guess is where you go out and you
snorkel people come here three four
times a year just to snorkel these spots
they're protected you're not allowed to
fish here so it really makes for a
beautiful reef and as you guys know by
all my vacation videos and my lifestyle
I love the ocean my entire tattoo is the
ocean I have a little ocean in my living
room I'm addicted to it so that's why
you always find me in these beautiful
little spots right here hidden amongst
the earth hot baby hot ready to do this
and we also be seen octopus today no
wants to find an octopus you know how
hard they are to find like sand castle
let me see oh I think you need wet arse
and you need wet sand stick
here we are day 35 basta see nothing to
be found
you're sitting just above a beautiful
coral reef it goes all up and down these
rocks and there's the beach way over
there they put these little uh basely
rest areas for you to catch your breath
and know you're doing awesome and I'm so
proud of you coming out here this is
rough rough water
but we made it
I'm so proud of you did you did the
whole trip guys this is I don't have you
can tell far this is but we stir down on
this end and dropped off in a boat all
the way down and then the current pushed
us pretty far out this way so no it did
a very adult snorkel trip ocean makes
you hungry man sir swim it just burns
calories we got here
the grill Kong a grouper
like I like deep fried grouper I don't
see it on there yet boy no you can fry
this that's what I just asked him yeah
that's fucking what you taking Noah
y'all kinds of stuff fresh mango
daiquiris fresh mango if I keep seeing
all the locals drinking this right here
ginger beard I thought I had alcohol

it's actually canned it's actually can't
here in the Bahamas artificial got a
pay-to-play
since 1874 here we go
but what no artificial flavor bag yeah
that's good you wanna try that it's like
really good ginger ale yeah what here no
it doesn't have beer it's a phase would
I give you something I'll go in it no
never
it's soda it's like root beer you drink
root beer ginger beer it's super good
hey okay so apparently guys if you hang
a bag of water just a bag of water in a
ziploc bag it keeps all the flies wet
what do you think of that III I don't
know if it's true so that's the trick of
the day bag of water over your food over
your kitchen over your kitchen table oh
that look I want that yes high five yeah
had a great time check this little
shopping cart out Kane it's a little
different than at home you can't really
ride in it well Paradise Cove was
freaking unbelievable guys definitely if
you come to this part of the Bahamas you
go there 10 out of 10 in my book

jar when you Rory on the backside of
