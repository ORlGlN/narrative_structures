 alright guys it's time for social
media 101 this is one of the oldest
tricks in the book and maybe it'll help
you guys to when you make a post that
you think is extra good picture or
something misspell a word you'll double
your comments it's like it's like a the
oldest trick in the book and in social
media major will tell you well some of
the most viral posts have a misspelling
on purpose but to be honest with you but
to be honest with you my latest posts on
both Instagram and Facebook we're not on
purpose but hey it does work like crazy
look at the comments everyone's telling
me how to spell so it doubles the
comments leads to more shares leads to
more people seeing it wasn't an accident
or was it on purpose
alright guys I'm gonna go in the vlog

prank Sunday Sunday morning or Sunday at
some time you come in you gonna end it
