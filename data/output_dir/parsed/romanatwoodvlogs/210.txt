what is up guys welcome to the vlog
Britt is making some crazy looking good
so it looks like something out of a
magazine oh I'm hungry if you watch
yesterday's vlog we are starting today
exactly where we left off yesterday
because we actually film yesterday's
vlog today as really strange to think
about yeah it's almost two blogs and one
day basically how it's worse we these
crazy guys down here yeah well we're
getting full use out of this puddle Oh
king of water for the pool until Sunday
to bring in three trucks to fill this
day up and then it's actually going to
be a pool I get nice I like it so for
now I want to get you guys back up in
the sky to update you on the property
I'm going to show you the side property
which I haven't showed you yet
I guess we're calling it backyard side
yard we need some names for this stuff
because it's about to be nuts there's
really no other better way to show you
guys the property let's go alright let
me show you the backyard first because
it's right here look at this place
look at this place it is it doesn't even
look like my house anymore like it looks
so crazy so yeah guys as you can see
here this place looks like just mayhem
it's just crazy
I find it very like mesmerizing to watch
this dirt go I feel like I could
literally watch that all day in person
it's like amazing now we're going to
head over to the side yard which is over
here alright guys this is the side yard
right here look at this place it's like
a whole nother bird oh so we got all
these containers over here for very
special something that's coming and then
they got all this construction over here
this is a whole different yard this is
not the back yard
this is crazy cwentun go up a little bit
this is a great shot of the side yard
just its mystery and what it's turning
into is I think all part of the fun I
want you guys to try to figure out what
the heck this is going to be we're going
to be performing something here that's
like I don't think I've ever seen any
youtuber ever try to do so this is going
to be something super fun and it's only
a few days away and this right here this
right here is my crazy little family all
right guys so there you have it there it
is of a backyard side yard project
rolling keeping up is it it's really fun
to watch it just becomes something
because right now it looks I don't know
how it's ever going to be kind you ready
to go little girl going to make this
happen remember like weeks and weeks ago
we talked about trying to have like a
dedicated day for date nights well that
still has that we have not one else
since that day I think oh yeah you gonna
have a GTR / GG r GG r baby traveller
we're going over to fire wordplay kinda
been there forever but I've been wanted
his since I think it was my birthday it
was my birthday where we attached the
roman candle to my dirt bike
I basically want to do that but to the
extreme I may want to do this since that
day and hopefully they have them here on
to buy my own flowers so weird
you think it's a good idea no League I
think they'll go cool everything goes
perfectly right it will cut planned but
duct tape it just right you can take it
feels like forever since I've been here
has been a long time this is perfect
they got my fireworks dude look at this
check this out they still got all these
well I guess they're new this year but
these Rockets are those are all well
know we had last year but like I thought
they were gone come on my rocket those
are the ones that do clown faces right
yeah who remembers the vlog years ago
when I was like one day I'm gonna have
my own fireworks it was like a joke and
now I literally have my own fireworks
dude these are the best I mean the
competition it looks like we have less
on the shelf
definitely so they must be selling good
this just cracks me up dude it just
cracks me up right we got a full case of
these things 15 in a box ha ha ha she
kickin yo you legit got a watermelon in
there I don't ain't on the baby there's
no watermelon as a basketball maybe we
are so set on this idea I am set on this
idea and we got the stuff to do it now
which I'm excited I have no idea how I'm
going to do it remember last time like
trying to light all the lumps of my
oranges remember I did eight on my honor
eight of them
it is definitely one of the nicest days
of the entire year
hi baby I can tell you this for sure
we're going to need that that is for so
just a part of each blog where I pretend
that I know what I'm doing but I have no
idea I'm just going to try to rig up
something that fits around maybe I
should do the four ways show you the
quad Geneva four-wheeler the dirt buddy
ever way more space on the four-wheeler
Oh baby baby what if I just Mountain
what if I just mount them to this board
four on each side maybe maybe four on
each side angled like that we mount it
cut it do the same thing on the other
side and then so I think what I want to
do is just build kind of a little box
around the back side of this mount the
the works angled this way and then
basically just ride into the light baby
right into that set this is the part
where I pretend I know what I'm doing
right here we've got this Oh as well
route it you don't want to see your man
doing this this is man stuff out here
it's like man building in there donkey
will try needed yeah don't use been
eating dog food is bad so what are you
doing over here then okay so four of
them we should do five already did eight
before on my hands all of us one look
above a now idea of a would committed
okay so let's at least try for let's no
we're gonna go for ten we got all eight
mothers can do the same thing twice
twice okay so basically I want to just
Felix I'd like this and then I'll sit on
this back way
so that's not smart well I'm definitely
done taping it but like look really here
in here
I need a market looks like that
dippity-do-dog Vivian rescued it back
away from me yeah I'd say so would
really really help if I look at long my
screws are that's the shortest screw I
have that's like gonna split this thing
wide open
don't believe me just watch don't
believe me just watch
oh my gosh on enough for awhile steady
now steady now
oh my gosh I'm going away might not one
right way
oh hey that's it this is pretend we
don't have screws right now we're
talking no we are talking just do it the
way I know to do it Oh place safe why
even mess around a metal my even my
Sarala
hmm I'll tell you make magic okay so
that's the one finished product I know
what you're thinking that's a gong
genius hey it looks heavy
he's heavy you'll be able to duct-tape
it well I'll probably rope it on one on
each side of me that'd be uh 10 of them
I think it looks good that was good but
if it the other one too and on the cross
path you know what I mean
oh yeah curly I definitely know what you
mean though
leave that that's like that's like the
Mad Max stuff how many did you have on
it last time 4 and 4 this is 5 and 5 on
my arms
no on the dirt bike 1 was it was just 1
yeah I think foreskin amis had turned on
I think 5 will be plenty okay oh man I'm
going to be waiting inside when you do
this what alright guys I know what
you're thinking I know what you're
thinking when we're gonna light it
here's the problem last time we did this
the most I've ever done is eight this is
ten and it took two of us with with
torches to actually light them all
Britany super pregnant and came too
young so I need hands and everybody have
cold so far has been busy right now so
I'm trying to make it happen at least
it's rigged up no matter what I got the
hard part done lighting it now God look
at that thing
okay so chase just showed up we've got
one lighter we're trying to figure out
what if what cameras and honestly trying
to figure out where to film this I don't
know if you can tell how big this hole
is guys it is massively deep and huge it
looks like nothing on camera it just
doesn't show up on camera how big that
is
it's massive the meteor hit Wow look at
this do we go get some RC trucks out
here look at that
Cameras Cameras Cameras everywhere this
is going to be I mean I guess if you're
doing something as it should be captured
correctly
okay so somewhere in this garage I've
been saving these for a rainy day last
time I wore these was actually with
fireworks so this all makes sense
oh geez Oh we'll fall okay we're here
this you ain't getting this bucket oh oh
okay oh stop fireman - you never be too
careful dude
got to go full fireman you've always
wanted me to be a fireman I guess he
thinks he's gonna catch themself on fire
no I want to prevent that possibility
thing looks it honestly looks like the
last ride okay it's go time
I should we got to warm it up without
getting it too hot because this side is
sitting on the exhaust right there so I
don't think that gets that hot though we
got the drone up we're trying to figure
out it's just chase tonight so we got to
figure out how we're going to light all
these tin fuses and then I got to take
off so I'm really excited I think it's
going to be beautiful shooting slow-mo
on the drone wide should be gorgeous
perfect light I think so dude
