all the cars oh my god and show you guys
the destruction up close we got Billy
batts pretty crazy shot now just imagine
every one of those cars full of your
favorite youtubers imagine that the
biggest demolition derby in the world is
about to happen
Oh epic so crazy like watching a car
your favorite youtubers in it just
smashing another youtuber I'm loving
this makes you so excited for what I'm
trying to do it even the worst it is
happening it's big it's huge but because
it's big and huge it takes a lot of time
so we're working on it it is happening
I'm preparing for the biggest demolition
derby and the real question is what
youtuber is gonna win the dirt
even crazier on having 50 cars built 50
cars built for youtubers to come drive
imagine 50 of these look at this guy
right here dude he got mold
it'll be like it'll be like your guys
Roman outlet and his beat-up car you got
17 team oh that looks like you right
there that is your car I don't know what
I'm supported today there's so missed
all these cars we be ready to rock and
just think every youtuber that
participates gets to come and paint
their cars any way they want they can
put their logos on them they're their
YouTube channels don't look at that one
I like that with the glue at the star
now what's taking so long as I have to
have 50 cars built they have to be the
exact same so that it's equal what's up
guys so all 50 cars have to be equal so
that everybody everybody has the same
chance you know cuz one car is way
better than everyone's gonna say they
cheated
for what prosecuted when you drive a car
are you serious
what about me I would totally do it I'm
crying it's chaotic fun hey you guys all
have a good time that's pretty wild
right would you like to see me in that
getting crushed up turned into it
turning into a Rubik's Cube

hurt but I'm sure my Derby people are
