the intrepid now which is an old
battleship giant frigging battleship

chased by that thing yeah going inside
the ship Mary Mary would have to sleep
this is next next level lifetime right
here is there any ships coming should
load the cannons all right good
I think somebody got sleepy on the right
over yeah you imagine what's even
crazier to think about coming buddy come
on now they used to land Jets on this in
the middle of the ocean you know that
these Jets would come and land on this
little runway the captain's bridge wow
this stuff really have meanings I think
these things I just see like steam
blowing out of these pipes yeah now
you're gonna stay in one of these rooms
and then we're gonna take a ride on this
boat I don't not good he knows good
thing we're not in a hurry
yeah if we are now underneath the ship
underneath this look at this propeller
huh whoa look at you
flex look at the muscles
who knows what that does that's what you
read that sign and find out stop it stop
it it's a steam accumulator an aircraft
carrier capsule propels aircrafts to
takeoff speed a relatively short
distance the steam accumulator a holding
tank for steam produced below decks
powered Intrepid's portside cap catapult
