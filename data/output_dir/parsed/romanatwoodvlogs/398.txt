one of her favorite things in the whole
world and that is the haunted house no
way I did not even want to go I'm
probably more scared than you Hey I
freaked out I'm thinking the jump out to
the worst nobody likes that I feel like
someone need
so just collab all of our screams in
like one funny short video I'm really
impressed with how well these haunted
house is haunted mansions haunted
whatever they are I'm so impressed with
how well they do is think about it who
wants to just go and be scared I don't
watch scary movies because I'm a chicken
at the end of the day it's just fun and
it's just like a high school kid
underneath that costume but to me it's
terrifying and I need it
what's upon a time it was a little girl
it's okay babe Chuck a little boy
haunted house yeah when you're a kid
we're not scary about that really maybe
I do have a desk tonight you'll see the
real me honey I brought this light for
the vlog tonight because I know in
haunted houses usually pretty dark
describe ruin the whole like mood of it
right let me go like
alright guys this is the place we just
arrived I'm getting my phone ready which
I put the fish eye on it this time sure
I look so much better to see everything
ready yeah you get nervous yeah we got a
Spence here with us helping us out with
this live stream we haven't seen him
since we built the pool with toilet
favorite you know this place is crazy
we're not even in it hey how are you Joe
this is rhomin hi hey Brittany this is
the the owner of this place right here
Kelly Collins Kelly Collins I'm also
known as dr. Mao practice doctor
malpractice yes he's given us okay so we
just got here he's giving us a tour of
this place and this is this this is
amazing
so you're the one that's doing all the
clown stuff hey hey hey come on look at
all these clowns dude I just want to be
one of the guys scaring people it's a
lot of fun I bet it's fun I want to
spend a couple hours just scaring people
what people from the fifties would have
worn as patients in the middle of asylum
ooh so that's what Michelle has been
making is kind of like what you sleep in
now every night what is going on here oh
that is something we are the we are the
first to have this made for us this is
the cotton candy or cotton Iraq and what
this is the person wearing it oh just
awesome and so when somebody comes up
and they you say hey you want some free
cotton candy and when they reach for the
cotton kid you looked a rat pop dude I
love that dude I think you and I could
get along really well yeah I think I'm
right at home here
I'm the practical joker
that's part of haunted houses is being a
practical joker because what you're
doing is you're creating scenes to scare
people I love that I know your videos
you love the startle and scared I do
well that's what we do here that we
design scenes to start with here
I don't think Brittany's into this
haunted house but she's a good sport
though she usually does anything I want
girls like what are we doing I'm a
menace no you know what
psychologists have analyzed haunted
houses and he actually say it's good for
you I'll tell you why did you pee your
pants no because why is it good scared
when you get scared it releases
endorphins needed what add orphans do
it's a cleanse it's an opportunity it
gives you the opportunity to fight or
flight and so what should get once you
get out and you realize you got all your
fingers and you got your toes and you're
okay well then you feel good there's
this endorphins it's like when we hit
the ground skydiving when you're all
done
whoo feel good feel good exactly and the
actor wariness puts this around her
without him around their waist their
hands go their hand goes up inside of
her like this oh my gosh and then
they've got a button for her I don't
have it turned on right yeah but you can
control the head you can control the
head then you can actually make her go
to a shower buddy all right that's
amazing man I love that that is
verifying it almost looks real good
Nicole ah so yeah great profit again you
have it around your waist and in the
actor who wears it acts like she's a
patient she's gotten loose and they're
trying to bite her and they're trying to
pull her off like so that's growling and
screaming that's great you gotta admit
that's pretty cool man I mean these are
all props and things that aren't being
used currently in the haunted house look
at all this stuff
