sending us footage from Ohio so it
should be cool it should be fun
interesting style to the vlogs and
you'll be able to keep up with
everything we're doing yeah I'm excited
about that I'm more excited cuz usually
when I travel it's just me on the vlogs

the vlogs are gonna be probably even
better for me than for you guys let's do
it little man you gonna get mommy home
save your the big boy the house now all
right guys

I love you
get home super safe come here bud give
daddy big juicy hug I love you guys
don't say that shouldn't say that
here we go brand-new journey the hardest
part about what I do my career might
that the things that I do is being away
from my family the only thing that I can
say is that this career that I do have
puts me around my family more than ever
when I used to work factory lifes I
never got to see Noah
it was so hard because I worked all the
time I was never at home so my kids get
to see more of me than ever it also
makes it harder also makes me spoiled
with my kids so I'm used to being around
them all the time so when I'm not around
them I'm freaking out drop this rental
car off and get this party started okay
all right okay here we go
well this totally blows look at this
look at this I'm gonna give a special
shout out to the valet guys over at our
hotel this this sucks
honestly so now they have to make a
rapport and I'll have to get the cost
right that's all work that's how it
works
dang this totally blows if I knew I was
gonna have a rapport I would've probably
done more down
I would have made it worth it well that
