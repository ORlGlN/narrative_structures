be made out of concrete and still flow
so we just got dropped off on that
what's this island gone I don't remember

footprints now there are it's still so
early in the morning we're like
shivering yeah this place is beautiful

like one minute in the vlog or something
but five hours went all the way around

entire place is Ohio State versus Oregon
