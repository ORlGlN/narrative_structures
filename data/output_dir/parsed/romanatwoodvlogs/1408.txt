you want to watch daddy on the news yeah
okay here I found the link prankster to
Secret Santa
millions of people follow Roman Atwood
on YouTube pulls off some hilarious
pranks right here on the streets of
Columbus but as ABC 6 has been garbage
now shows us his latest viral video
comes from his softer side Roman a twit
loves taking videos anywhere and
everywhere I guess I'm just an ordinary
guy that loves making people smile so
this is this is uh this is just fun for
me
nearly three million people subscribed
to his videos on YouTube his latest one
is already blowing up Roman and a friend
dresses out they drag a decorated
Christmas tree and put it near sleeping
homeless people then they leave presents
underneath run off and wait for their
reaction it was so beautiful they woke
up and they they got to experience a
little Christmas and that was it was one
of the greatest things I've ever done
it's hard not to smile as one man wakes
up and realizes his Christmas miracle
his face lights up as he finds his
presence a blanket and a few other
things to help him stay warm it's
definitely not rival Roman and his buddy
did the same thing in a homeless shelter
leaving coffee donuts and more presents
one morning when I was 25 with no
Christmas the first morning in my life I
didn't have a Christmas and it was so
painful that it really did inspire me to
go out this year and give the homeless
Christmas morning and he's hoping this
random act of kindness will inspire
others to do the same if my work can get
