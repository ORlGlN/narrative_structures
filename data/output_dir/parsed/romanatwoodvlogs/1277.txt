old man's cave which is a fun place for
the kids especially for the kids but
also fun for the adults what it's fun
place to uh lose yourself in nature
going down down down this is pretty cool
huh yes no this is actually the same
area oh if you guys remember you'd have
to be a real viewer a real longtime
viewer to remember where we went
rappelling and we went down all the
cliffs this is like that area
honestly I wouldn't believe that Ohio
has anything like this we going in one
slowpokes the Cave of Wonders
looks like we found a waterfall and
everybody else did too
lift it up pick it up this place is
pretty awesome man I love it
a water leaking through the top what do
you think of this place I want to know
why it's called old man's cave we an old
man used to live in what is it there's
an old man owns this the old man owns it
there's a chance okay I'm gonna find out
we got to find out why it's called old
man's cave so one thing you always got
to remember when you're hiking is that
you always have to go back haha dude oh
I guess I didn't really show you guys
the amount of steps that it takes to get
up here but I got to get in shape some
old guy who you're climbing all them
steps he's like I don't know who that
lady was but she had a kid on her back
he's he's like I can't even make it up
these steps she's got a kid on it back I
was complaining to I feel like I'm
playing like real-life Indiana Jones
yeah uncharted okay oh here it is this
is why old man's caves called old man's
cave cave was named for old man Richard
Richard Rowe a recluse who made the cave
his home in the 1800s
so Richard Rowe old man used to live in
the cave down here that's why it's
called that good whoo good job
I know what you mean I had to carry no
on my back I would put my bottle in here
but it probably caused like a great
collapse oh my gosh - don't even touch
it collapse see when we came here today
we were supposed to meet Jason Veronica
with their kids but the only thing we've
seen the entire time
was their Jeep the jeeps here I don't

yeah one last question one last question
for endless somebody did suggest it
would be way cooler if I open the box
and have me
Brittany cane and Noah sign the ps4 also

that would be pretty cool I cannot like
in a silver marker I don't know maybe
maybe I will just ask the winner whoever
wins I'll just send you a private
message and I should be done do that I
think that'd be pretty cool that'd be at

away that ps4 so stay tuned don't forget
