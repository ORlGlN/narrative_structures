all right we're out of there and we are
off to see the Wizard The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz
so it's pretty crazy for us to share you
know certain things about our life very
private things about our life but I feel
like you guys have been with us it's our
work we just passed 800 blogs yesterday
and I realize you guys have been a lot
of you have been here since day one and
you're for our family you are a part of
our everyday adventures in today you
guys may know a couple months ago
Brittany to some pregnancy test
they came back negative we really
actually thought she was pregnant she
wasn't today we are going on once again
for round 2
I well it's just I like to drive
actually
delay nearly all my best friend and I
are always like
on track with each other most girls
understand so weird it's so weird but
it's just so weird
that's how it is she's like oh that's
been gone for a while now look wait what
yeah you're late to the party that's for
sure so yeah we
you know some things are kind of hard to
put the vlog because obviously if she
was pregnant you don't really want to
announce that until you know you know
the baby's healthy you know everything's
going good at least that's how I feel
about it
so if she is you guys will be here from
the very second that we know which can
be cool but it's also risky it's also
scariest you know you don't want to buy
you dinner
finally we talk about my jazz
they were the first people so yeah guys
that is what's going on tonight thanks

we're going to see literally you're
going to be watching the same time we

say this just like always
it's always better in the morning so we
won't exactly know tonight if it's
positive it's positive there's a good
chance well well well
