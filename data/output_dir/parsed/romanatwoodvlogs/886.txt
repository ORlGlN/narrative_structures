disappointing to tell them or not we
should make up a band so we like we can

our band right here that's what
everybody asks do we we could have the
greatest boy band look at you guys the
wind blown in your hair I always wanted
to be one that's what you've been
working for today we're working on a
challenge I've never seen done before
and I thought what better way to do it
then with the Dudesons these guys these
guys are designed for things like this
they're built to take it so we bought
5,000 5,000 roll of firecrackers
well line us up we're gonna test one out
let's test this baby out
you know there's like going back to old
school yeah I'm scared of that shit
I'm taking you guys back to your roots
so before this challenge we thought it
was fair to all of us that we buy a role
just to test and make sure this is even
possible for these guys they're getting
old so so we're going to light it as is
we're not going to separate
whoa how do you do that all right so
we're setting up cameras GoPros of
course help the situation I'm gonna try
to handhold this stupid camera dude
good luck this is not gonna be fun okay

we're ready to go everyone's a little on
the nervous side hey one more thing if
there's a serious emergency say Palo
Alto that's an emergency where Colorado
Balda Palo Alto trucking finish Palo
Alto

behind plastic that was so fun man that
was I'm so glad we had we had a lot of
talks about this video and I'm truly

shooting BRB you're first up

maniac so to actually load the gun you
have to pull back and let go all the way
