first person destroy it by accident but
that's not my goal
just like that looks like it's about to
rain again if you watch yesterday's vol

stuff you guys know that you definitely
know that she's got like her
rocking-chair for baby that came that
needs bill we got this little wagon cart
for the quad for the dog
key stuff this is all kinds of weird
stuff for when he wants to just be
outside yeah so when you think you can
get to that this is 1/2 it's like a
little trailer where you want you just
drag it with a rope there we go let it
try to bolt together is that sprinkles
yeah
oh I could I could maybe just have to do
this later you can put it in the flour
sir last night get great away oh it's
nice let's not get carried away way too
many people
mmm 14 and a half hours later I got one
side of this thing built it's the first
time ever that I might build some that I
may be better than the object and so if
this thing breaks there's not because of
my duel
I want everybody know that it's not
because of me maybe a little maybe it's
a little me piece of cake
Liza I need help building this I need
your help can you help me Liza you can

positive they long alright guys so I
just about got the trailer bill it's
been about what 19 total hours 1920 1921
it on no sleep here we got the trailer
almost built and I just came up with uh
let me get this thing in focus I was
live streaming now I'm in livestream
mode today in between the last taking
the fake I did a full livestream
hopefully some of you saw it but I get
into livestream mode where I just don't
cut the camera it's like it's like a
weird difference between vlogging and
livestream anyways while I was live
streaming I said look at this trailer
look at the tires it's set for offroad
right going it's made to go off-road so
let's hook it to the quad and pull it
through the mud hole to swamp the road
means to go I'm like off the road not
like fusion water well yeah but it's a
good idea right what are you doing he's
a rock eater you a rock eater boy maybe
it's not a rock into oh my gosh no I
wouldn't put your face in his mouth
Oh was a rock flash is like see that's
why I just staying here I don't I don't
I don't participate in that rocky and
concept that's where we're at this
boring awful trailer bill has now turned
into a really bad idea yes dad I didn't
spell it wrong G ad GAD is bad good bad
idea and even that's bad
that's it off-road buggy trailer go
right through that mud hole with what
are you gonna put in the bottom of it
for the kids to sit on won't think
they're good yeah
water's gonna be able to flow so he's
gonna go right back all right now
there's how you mount a trailer to a
four-wheeler will flat-head screwdriver
and some rope
I think you go nowhere before you laugh
at me this is the pin that came with it
he's tiny
it doesn't even fit through the hole are
you ready to go through you're down
you're not backing out
I see if I can get any better place you
ready I know you're ready hey where you
