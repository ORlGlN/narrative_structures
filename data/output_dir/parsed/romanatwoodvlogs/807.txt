I am downtown today business management
you know as a youtuber as a businessman
as an entrepreneur I have to have very
good business management you see what
the internet doesn't tell you is that
youtubers we have to pay a lot of taxes
because we're paid as if almost we're
getting paid in cash we get paid the
total and at the end of the year it's up
to us to pay those taxes so when you see
all these crazy websites and magazines
and YouTube videos posting about how
much we make they don't tell you how
much taxes we're paying that's for sure
it is bad and this is Columbus Ohio you
