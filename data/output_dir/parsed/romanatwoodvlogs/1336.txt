wireless remote got your Boyd Gilroy /
aka cameraman / best cameraman slash
forward slash hashtag good father / new
blogger new vlogger coming soon coming

talk them into it trying to park the
city is busy others a good spot when I
do yeah get it I'm out over here okay Oh
Tom get the hot coffee on what's up
Brody sup buddy everyone misses you
I mean I got my driver's license
suspended cuz he's a criminal
we uh we are getting our coffee on or
our food on and then we're hitting we
haven't done public living on a public
prank for a long time
seal em up antsy in my pants you've no
idea how sick what these reactions are
going to be why can't wait classic it's
gonna be classic
mmm instantly you know vlogging when you
choose the vlog and what do you vogue
well according to my viewers you just
flog everything and then during editing
you decide what goes in and what goes
out I don't know okay so here's what
we're doing guys
we're trying to figure out today we need
a hidden camera to go around all kinds
of places like stores and things like
I'm thinking a duffle bag like this I'm
going to cut a hole where the camera
goes inside the lens is actually in
there I've seen people do that and I
usually use a shoebox but I just think a
bag is more in oh wait I can get in
anywhere with this bag even a bank which
ones are your favorite it's kind of yen
what hi hi what made some minor surgical
cuts to our bag we're going to mount
some double-sided tape here so our
cameras it's solid and then we will cut
the hole out of this use the strap to
block the lens when we're not using it
should be perfect walk into any building
that doesn't have a security scanner
go right in that's it doesn't get any
more simple than that man a couple zip
ties and you've got a very solid camera
it doesn't move and oh that's it pull
strap down you're ready to film baby
boom not bad is it for
well you know that's when I will you're
welcome on the weekends
everybody's welding on the weekend this
is the Ohio State Library we film a lot
we have filmed a lot of videos number is
huge
instant instant kick-out didn't even
last a minute I call the cops
instantly fall in the house everybody
can have fun in this uh nobody can have
fun anymore
it's the police arrested you will be
we've now been we've now been kicked out
of the Ohio State Library for life and
definitely and definitely never again
are we allowed to step foot in the
library without going to jail and being
charged with criminal trespassing
frankly god that's a new one right there
did I saw that lady walk in that was
well I know I started laughing she's in
public she's the one from the tenth
prank sex in public tenth prank she she
hates us she hates us well we didn't
last long in the library not even five
minutes I don't even think we we got a
reaction whatsoever the cops ran us out
kicked us out for life we're never
allowed to go in there again I think we
should get two people that look
identical to us to go in there
cops will show up and it's not even us
right in there the right and actually
the cops are out here still
it's the cuff peace out visa please the
Dennises license is actually suspended
he's not allowed to drive right now just
found out literally this week so Gilroy
has been driving all day I think the
police that kicked us out fake Dennis is
driving his truck and that's why they're
following us they're going to be really
disappointed if they pull us over just
go to a brand new Steakhouse here in
Columbus look at their potatoes Wow

wouldn't a stakeout

can go back in we just can't have a
camera with us how bad actually the cops
are the cops they're asked the guy if
you want him to leave make cuffs didn't
