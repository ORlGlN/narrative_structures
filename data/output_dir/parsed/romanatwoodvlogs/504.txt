like a roman candle it's like the
jacked-up version of a roman candle
crazy Balkan and then beautiful there
you have it guys if you want to get my
fireworks they're available they're out
there in all the stores yes haha all
right where should I do it maybe on the
wood part yeah you good yeah let's do it
it's a special one first person that
gets here I'm going to sign this one for
you it's the only one
well if somebody comes and get this you
better send me a picture I want to see
if anybody comes and gets this one I
love it man
every time you get that negative thought
which happens all the time it happens to
me too I think negative all the time and
I have to force myself it's way easier
to be negative and it's easier to be
whiny it's easier to complain but the
things that life gives you when you
become positive and the energy that grow
up telling you man it sounds crazy but
you've got to listen to me your life
will change if you start being positive
you start being good to people trust me
I'm not perfect I've made a million
mistakes I'm not perfect I'm not
claiming to be butch all of me we all
make mistakes we've all done things that
we wish we didn't do it's just life
that's how we learn that's how we grow
that's how we become the bigger and
better versions of ourselves learn if
you add a little hint of positivity into
these lessons man you'd be unstoppable
you'd be the next one you'll be the next
