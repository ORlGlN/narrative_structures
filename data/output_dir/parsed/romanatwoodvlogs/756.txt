things for everybody like we used to be

pump your gas cuz everyone steals gas
bogus Hey Dude hey come here come here I
left all the lengths I just shaved the
sides hey that's my best friend oh
you're both my best friends oh just one
of you I can't ever get you're like a
little wiggle worm at the bag do you
remember when cuddle time was real and
you just got the hold him thought you
guys if you have kids you know how nice
it is when your kid just cuddles with
you it doesn't exist now it's like China
Oh
all day long now if the payment candy
bar Stephen leicht with you
are you breaking it all out look at this
thing what relax I'm just testing it out
is it charged okay guys so before we
went to hang on we need some lights we
need some lights there we go
before we left for Washington Dyson the
company Dyson sent us let me show you
this thing this is awesome we need to
break this out like tonight
Dyson sent us this super awesome
humidifier look at this thing it's like
an alien spaceship yeah I mean honey put
it down put the sweeper down so sit in
my blogs before that I hate wires I hate
them it's the worst thing everything
should be Wireless Dyson sent us a
wireless sweeper I'm not even kidding
it's Wireless let me see this thing what
is it for the couch or anything let me
see this
we are amazing idea what yes instead of
wiping up part down out there I can
sweep it with this you want to see mommy
do that all right me too let's do it do
it right now
so straight up I'm going to show you
that the funny thing is like this look
we actually own a decent sweeper
straight up oh geez that's our sweeper
is obvious right out of the box what
this thing will do get up right little
girl who is that in there
I think it's pretty obvious that this
sweeper Wireless will change the way you
clean your house forever
like it just so you know as of now it
makes you clean your house yes cuz
normally she wouldn't be up there
cleaning coming up does it make your
clean your help so how does it make you
clean your house differently than if you
had a big sweeper how about for starters
it actually makes you clean your house
this week might have done that without
this thing I know I don't seem to do it
so long remand readiness yeah it's
difficult now you can just get anywhere
so basically the way it's designed the
battery no wire all the accessories it
just makes life better 100% for cleaning
imagine if we had this when we blew this
house up with flour the whole house was
flour you would have had the house clean
soap we paid hundreds of dollars that
people clean our house that thing would
have done it no problem look at this
thing it's like a sports car of sweepers
I think normally when you see a sweeper
of this size you think it's for these
little messes and these you know little
kitchen things it's a beast it'll do
it's unbelievable it's a powerhouse
we've already sucked up nasty crap man
I've already emptied it once so again
