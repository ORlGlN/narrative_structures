quick story for you guys before we get
into our next crazy idea this TV how old
do you think this TV is this an old when
would we get this about 2003 2003 13
years old when 2002
it's got to be older invert it seems
like it anyways
is this the one we moved this one that
one upstairs is it broke yeah oh there's
your old 60 I know so we're pushing it
up this mud hill
we're sweating it's hot and we exchanged
it for the frigerator which you did see
the frigerator that we put in his garage
it was so much work it almost killed us
he kept falling over on the dolly
because of the dirt we watched one movie
with it hmm I call Rome and I say I send
him a picture of us watching the TV so
excited like we didn't watch how joyous
that our efforts were the next day I
turn it on it goes blank
pump pump aha revenge it's time sorry
its history in the making a lot of you
guys were too young even like I've seen
TVs like this movie so they're all flat
and they're small and they're thin and
they hang on your wall now but these are
um they're just massive and this is
actually one of our old TVs that no
longer works we brought a bunch of guns
and I was like what can we shoot my mom
and dad said we've got two TVs that
don't work perfect you guys got it I got
common you got that and I got the cord

of you 3 2 1 oh my gosh it just plugs
straight through it that's pretty cool
now look through the hole
