all right let's start this out welcome
back to the house flight late Kenny wait
those are what you're wearing
yeah other month that makes sense all
right welcome to the vlog guys Tanner
and Sean we're supposed to they actually
are flying out later today so we decided
let's roll on something let's make some
points God dang it out yeah so we got
everyone here the kids playing on the
rock wall most of the day build it Bryan
just set up a slackline we bought a
couple days ago which none of us have
any experience on I've tried filming
like way back in the day a couple guys
in a park had one and I put my foot on
it it was so wobbly a little basically I
knew at that moment that I don't know
how to slap mine so we got one chase
working on something for Wednesday right
super fun yeah we're heading out doing
something just unbelievable Brits over
here in baby vomit what is that ice
cream it's not ice cream with it I love
yogurt or something about that just
doesn't say yogurt so we're all set like
it's all you already put it out it's
done it's ready that's a bit cold you
should put clothes on hey it went from
like find a nice yesterday the freezer
it's supposed to snow again tonight no
now that you guys are leaving we're
getting more snow snow snow boardies
snow way well this trip there's really
no avoiding the modded I mean we left
yesterday super muddy today equally
muddy but we have this crazy zipline
wait is this not a zipline it's it's a
slackline I think I'm still asleep I had
a rough night Brian did you follow all
the instructions because I don't
remember seeing like a big knot on there
on the paper so slacklining to me is
like I see it like I've been out like
Santa Monica and they're doing flips and
they're making it look so awesome that
dude you're doing it no way to me likes
like learning is so difficult when you
work you guys have absolutely done this
um I tried it once it like I show like a
small one that was indoors by
oh my god to me slacklining is like
if I was the guy that invented
slacklining and then I tried it one time
I'd be like alright this will never work
and then you have people that turn it
into an art and they've so good at it
and it looks so fun so today we're gonna
take our attempt at this first time ever
and just see what happens in the
consequences extreme mud if you fall so
that's I mean look how deep did its poop
oh yes OOP OOP OOP sue who's gonna do
the first flip who's gonna do the first
flip dude you're doing really good
actually really good no it helps it
helps put some weight on it yeah and now
it's getting slick right that's a good
idea actually so we don't keep getting
it muddy so you left or right foot first
like what do you think
I don't really know oh my god
why is my leg so wobbly Oh
oh my god Romy's doing it that was so
good
it's like wobble dogging dude I'm just
was the inventor this would be called
wobble dog I feel like I'm on that one
well thing for yesterday okay alright I
give it some pressure guys I think Shawn
needs a helping hand helping hand give
him a helping hand you know what I'm
saying like a little helping hand would
be nice that's actually there you go
you know I thought I'd be good that I
was lying it's myself when I see them do
it their arms are always like you know
what I mean they're like a cat's tail
well this is actually really cool I feel
like I could be a trampoline shape it
you could get do a flip right now town
right that boy he's gonna walk gentle
water get it sorry you need to walk this
long how do they do it you got it you
got it Stan here's my initial thought
it's very uh I don't feel like I mean
I'm in control of it I feel like it's in
control of me why am I out of breath
like what I'm not doing anything it's
just why am I out of breath I think the
first step is not walking you just got a
wobble dog wobble dog baby Wawa wobbly
housing shoes working out they're
starting to snow look see the snow

human food like things different than
milk so it's time to get around chair I

so you want to go buy it
just like I already got this fun little
toy what why do I want your stuff what
is that Cora what is good job baby
what is that by the way what is it the
wind makes it a little brutal hop in I
know them flakes don't feel good on your
back I was walking out in every flake
damn you look a little cat big cat I
guess I would be a bit smashing being
out in the snow like it doesn't really
doesn't really translate on camera but
it's it's really pretty so you guys know
on this channel we do everything from I
was trying to inspire you guys try to
uplift you guys try to leave you you
know when you watch these videos I want
you to finish the video with a little
inspiration a little motivation to go do
whatever it is you want to do these guys
that I've been working with last couple
days they come from the similar mindset
of you know we've all actually started
at zero when I started YouTube you guys
know I didn't know a single youtuber it
took me over two and a half years they
get 40,000 subscribers like I really I
really feel like I earned my youtube
career so these guys come from that that
similar like field of like if you have
any inspiration for my viewers to maybe
maybe they want to be whatever it is
they want to be how do they help just
tackle it and live it and earn it
and you know I always say you got to eat
it sleep it live it 100 you know you've
got a literally sag there's a lot of
sacrifices have to be made for me it's a
lot of family Tom know one of my biggest
supporters he's been with me since I
started this whole career so it's like
he knows what it's like to sacrifice
some time so that we can have and do
some of the crazy things we get to do
and I want these guys to throw a little
inspiration at you right now is we're
just chilling here relaxing on what we
thought they weren't even gonna be here
so do you have any like advice of course
I do I love this so I called my show the
best day ever every day the best yeah
the thing I like about Roman is he's
super relatable I think a lot of times
people think you need to grow up in New
York City or in LA to become successful
or famous or chase your dreams and like
you know there's that movie thing where
we have to move to LA to chase your
dreams I'm from Utah and I had big
dreams and I wanted them all first it
started out with skateboarding
snowboarding I wanted to be a pro so I
got after everyday and I learned flips
and cool stuff and like it was awesome
but then the dreams changed like you can
chase more than one dream and then I
found this way to like communicate with
everyone it was on snapchat which I
didn't even start on YouTube everything
shouldn't get famous on YouTube like do
whatever you love and what you're
passionate about and then like let the
rest just kind of happen but I started
on snapchat I started making these cool
drawings like can you just like pop a
bunch of drawings up right here after
you supply them all supply and pop up
these snapchat drawings so I made those
with my finger was really fun and then
that kind of led into YouTube and like
now I have this whole audience that I
talk to every day on my camera and every
YouTube video is called the best day
ever number one two three we've done
like 800 of them now so I guess what I
want to leave with you guys is number
one thanks for the invite Roman baby fun
number two whatever you guys's dreams
are you can chase them exactly where you
live it doesn't have to be YouTube or TV
or fame it can be like whatever you want
it to be chase it and then see where it
goes like don't let any small
opportunity pass by if I never would
have tackled snapchat which is what I
really wanted to do I never would have
found YouTube and this cool friendship
like all this stuff till I don't think
too big just take every little
opportunity and try to make it as big as
possible and that's that's how you love
the best life ever right there
I'm gonna add to that because he said
something about like don't like I always
say do what you love and make money the
byproduct like money comes with what you
love to do right and right now there's
this big image on YouTube when I started
YouTube you couldn't make money on
YouTube right so it was definitely out
of some passion right yeah but right now
there's a big outlook like you do
YouTube for money and I gotta say if you
do YouTube for money it's gonna be a
very painful like start it's gonna be
really tough that's my first check was
like it wasn't even a check it's 58
cents on YouTube and that was after like
grindin for like two years or so like
it's crazy yeah so like money does come
with doing things you love I always say
that Tanner do you have anything you
want to add yeah I kind of want to touch
on the subject I feel like this is like
relatable to a lot of your viewers maybe
so growing up I was always like bullied
for pretty much everything I did I was a
professional ski rider so I scooted
since I was 10 years old and kids always
just make fun of me for that then I
started making YouTube videos for like 5
years before I really started growing a
following and I used to get bullied for
that everywhere so I like I got kicked
out of the school I didn't want to go to
public school because I knew I'd get
bullied for it so my biggest thing from
that is like really follow your dreams
and do what makes you happy and that's
why I always say that because it's so
true to me like I grew up being bullied
and if I would have listened to them and
stopped I would have been stuck in the
same pit of my hometown with all those
other kids that told me that I was like
Oh names you know they've called me
names for all that stuff so that's why I
always tell people to like do what makes
you happy and follow your dreams and
don't listen to other people I know that
sounds so cliche but like I really do
mean it and I definitely live by that
yeah I think everybody that makes it to
a certain position says cliche things
does it is true but you have I don't
know it's confusing just do whatever you
love yeah and it will take you where you
need to go even if you don't make money
doing it you enjoyed your life and by
the way and by the way how many times
you're gonna fail over like you're gonna
I feel this so like oh my gosh I'm just
ready I thought it would be the coolest
business ever
I owned a skateboard snowboard shop I
was so hard the coolest and I was
probably great it was amazing I got this
cool silver stuff
the worst part like no one ever came in
it fell that was my first business that
fell but it taught me a lot about
business and if it didn't fail you
wouldn't have found the next
right didn't learn a lot so failure is
perfectly okay we have to fail actually
if you don't fail you're probably not
successful like you've had to have
failed at some point yeah to get to the
next spot
to learn more to better yourself to
create the better version of you because
we're all learning and you got all this
Noah are you taking no for you one more
no success isn't what you achieve it's
who you achieve it with it's like the
people around you like YouTube I'm with
my family all day you're with your
family hanging out with Tanner we travel
all over like it's who you're with that
makes the success work and by the way
we've all been through the whole like
that's never gonna work speeches like
that's a bad idea
we've all went through that but the
passion is what pushes you to do it no
matter what anybody says and we're all
youtubers right so we've all heard all
the hate we've all been talked down on
but we still just do what we love to do
so hope I hope that leaves you with a
little inspiration today this is hot tub
talks if you like hot tub talks maybe
yeah what we'll do more of these that I
figured while we're chilling we might as
well do a little inspiration and just
talk from the heart
okay so thank you guys and it's been a
great trip great trip or not having like
really any major plans together this
this was really fun it's it's fun to
just come up with things on the on the
fly it's a great trip I'm gonna change
the name real quick you've heard of TED
