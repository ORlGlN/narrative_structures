super super creative I got these stars
around my wrist and they were just
Hollow there was nothing inside of them
the middle star is for my dad hang on
it's blurry blurry tunafish the middle
stars for my dad it's like his own
Hollywood star cuz he's a super star to
me I got the be tattooed for Britt the N
added for Noah the K added for Kane and
I had this empty star right here yeah
there's meant to be because there's a
bullet in the oven what letter do you
think should be on there that's crazy to
think about right yeah or you think it's
all if it's a girl if it's a girl you
know what I thought is
boy Rome would still be amazing but I'm
like we've been talking about naming our
girl Rome for so long I'm feel that if
we did have a boy name in him Rome
that's all we were going to name our
girl forever we've always wanted yeah

Rome Rome I think it's a beautiful night
I think it's very good you don't like it
