your eyes you have icicles hey he's
gonna live by the time he actually gets
to his location it's all gonna be gone
you can just see the whole road is
freaking covered this was a straw or hay
straw hey guys welcome to the vlog hope
you're feeling good hope you're having a
great day Brittany and I have a little
alone time right now we're running out
we have had so much snow it's in the
black hole the community no it's gone
we got more snow last night you guys saw
on the vlog it snowed all night we got I
don't even know how much was like
another four or five inches of snow
awesome but we are planning it's really
dark hey nice to see you hardly are you
excited for this trip that we're going
on your trip your birthday trip
we are Brittany loves every we try to go
each year for your birth it's like her
thing
we try to go snow skiing or somewhere to
snowboard ski whatever it is and you've
been doing that for the first time this
year around her birthday so we're going
up to look at some gear which is getting
out like out of the house we've been
like what's it called a recluse what's
what's that call we don't even leave
your house you just like a recluse I
think I'm smart so we're out and about
it's beautiful it's sunny look at this
the snow is gonna be melting which
stinks that's - and I missed it but we
were counting I'm gonna come out cars in
the ditch just to where we're going this
- - completely buried in the ditch
there's number three number four that
was getting pulled out cheers first
thing we're gonna do is throw this
little diet right out the window
gee that is a good name it's so awesome
outside it's freezing but it's beautiful
we are you know what last time I was
here Aspen Skiing boards like a place
here in Columbus last time I was here I
couldn't even afford to buy anything
here I remember coming here not like
looking at snowboards to be like I could
never have that so weird and for the
record for the record most ski and
snowboard stuff is expensive so I
remember coming in here and just been
like just mind blown like why would you
pay that for a pair of gloves you know
what's random cheetahs leopards like
when skis are on sit when they're on
sale for eight hundred dollars I think
you get my point like it is an expensive
hobby
we always rented like I'd have to rent
if I wanted to ski there's supposed to
be four foot above your head so like
yeah you can use short skis I usually do
this ski planes but I go I kind of want
to get a pair
so many snowboards these are awesome
oh my gosh we gotta get the kids look at
this stuff dude look at that
pick up that board pick up their board
dad you put one on each foot
everything for kids is cooler like it's
just cooler it's colorful and bright
colors okay Brittany got skis bindings
boots poles
I got snowboard binding boots and we
both got helmets um is that that's
everything we got right two thousand
three hundred and eighty bucks dude that
is an expensive hobby right there but if
you think about it think about if you if
you rode dirt bikes your dirt bike cost
more than all of that
think about if you go how many times you
rent skis every time we've probably
spent that in just rentals yeah you know
I mean if you think of the gear it seems
like so much money but if you think of
most hobbies my fish tank yeah
everything hobbies are expensive dude
it's so bad oh okay warping back home -
it's very get stuck in that washer so
what'd you guys think tires or tracks
tires are tracks which one do you like
it looks cute well cute you know I don't
know if that's the look I'm going for
but yeah I don't know the tracks I think
looked better but it is so fun with the
tires and you can just just have so much
hi she is six months today she's like

it that's a salt spreader put salt in
there and then it's that's why the
driveways clear because the salt yep
