welcome to the vlog guys can I ask you
something like a serious question Wow
like I'm dead seriously you got to be
honest with me do my eyebrows look weird
bro it is are you serious are you just
doing that to get my reaction what did
you do show me show me are you serious
Shan Hsiung right here and right here
really I thought it was only one what do
you do shaving no okay ask me fry bro
hang on there's no shame in doing my
thing and I was like all this is kind of
high up here so I was like just I went
like with electric razor with this is it
slipped down
oh right here oh you pointed it right
out I think we're just kidding I
actually stopped it looked at you today
yeah - I was like so it's noticeable
some of the one-eyed bandit now is it's
only one it's this one yeah that one's
really bad but I have no room to talk I
know I love your eyebrow what is up guys
hope you're having an awesome day we are
hanging out the house is a mess the
dishes ain't done but we're having fun
yeah what so guys over there
what was that who's that hey you guys
gonna wanna come down here I got
something cool both of you get your
butts down here now I have something
that hang on I mean let me tripod mount
you real quick over the last couple
months we have been talking about
feeding the eel that's how I feed my eel
and we've had to feed him live crawfish
like crawfish for the first time today
my eel ate frozen krill which is just
little square blocks of frozen krill so
my idea
right out of this thing like you pinch
it and then you just grabs it my idea
right now is let's put a GoPro on here
and see if we can get some first-person
feel feeding action to be awesome I
already know
all right let's help even crazier and
even crazier check this out this is the
actual GoPro we used in the flamethrower
bit this is if you miss that bit this
way this flame thing this GoPro was in
the fire extinguisher quick quick dude
it's still recording I'm not kidding the
light is on it's not recording anymore
you need a glove and you need to detach
the top he looks per√≥n oh I see some
serious heat problems oh my god it was
insane it literally fell into fire this
is the same GoPro we're gonna put in
with the eel now let's see what we can
put this thing through I was so excited
that the footage was on there but when I
saw it still work I knew it'd be fine
alright let's test it out Bom Bam Bam
Bam Bam Bam
we're all set up my only worry is that I
fed him four cubes this morning he
hadn't eaten about a month I think they
only eat about once a month anyway my
only actual fear is that was one of my
fears actually I shouldn't talk about
that maile actual fear is that he's full
and won't eat and I think he will these
guys eat no matter what
this tank is beautiful baby you got a
little algae on there I think it's just
diatoms those are normal it's a normal
algae in a new tank so hopefully what a
boon
what up guys what up I know you're
beautiful you don't have to show me all
the time this fish right here is the
killer back here behind the s we have
the eel you can kind of see him like
there oh dude I'm sitting there looking
for the e oh he's looking right at me
look huh
see him that's his face right there he's
looking right at your breathing all
right you gonna get some food dude this
stuff stinks so bad awesome smell it
Kane just smell it smell it Tom
smell it all right here we go it's
Phoebe E Oh baby I'm excited about this
this works
seriously it's gonna be so exciting
because I've been wanting to do this
since we got the tank I talked about
feeding eel but every time we fed him it
is really gruesome like to feed him a
live crawfish it's kind of sad I don't
like the feature that so now he's eating
frozen food it should be pretty fun her
did 10 bucks eat 110 bucks
it's just fish it's just krill it stinks
like a horse barn dude oh no all right
the artboards keeping the fish from
eating it here we go
we're going in
bryggen awesome so uh it's like a dream
of mine to have an eel in my house that
you can feed this isn't your house
whelming what it's not his house oh he's
happy now he just ate so much he's out
again
days like I like this I hope that came
out good that was so much fun I can't
believe he ate so well idiot earlier so
guys we have finally successfully fed
the eel and the GoPro should make it fun
I hope how much would it take for you to
hand feed the eel just with your bare
hands I think Han funny can you do a
bunny hop no all wheels have to come up
to be a bunny hop oh yeah check this out

absolute crazy story you want to hear it

story about honesty boys I want you to
listen up I want you to listen up yeah

addiction you have an RC problem and my
dog absolutely this is not my RC this is
my dogs are seen you can always tell
because of all the the tooth prints and
the scrapes and the scratches and this
is actually multiple bodies we've had to
replace these because my dog does get
them so what we're going to do right now
is wear him out and I bet flash joins in

complete back up with another brand new
body right here so over time Zeus eats
them and when we replace them watch how

what I love really what y'all do it's
just for a minute

want to drive whoa lost it this is your
shot your one opportunity I'm going to
show you how how difficult it is to
drive this truck around Zeus Zeus knows
and fully understands that this is his
truck so he's allowed to be as hard as
he want with this RC he's not like this
with other are sees good luck
oh it is now it's this is good job buddy
oh thanks for getting it way to go dude
way to go oh man total Nile Asian oh no
where did he even go go get it oh my god
it's so deep in there huh
oh if it wasn't upside down I could just
drive it out so one of the things that
I've always said is if they make one of
these trucks if they make one of these
trucks with a Kong body you know that
hard rubber Kong body just for dogs
imagine this made out of a Kong you know
the things you put peanut butter in and
then you leave it for like a dog-sitter
imagine an RC body made out of that
material where he could just chew an ox
he destroys this he actually just ripped
it off the truck
