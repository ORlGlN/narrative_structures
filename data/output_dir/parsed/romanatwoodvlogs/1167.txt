what's up guys good afternoon to you do
to my ridiculous hangover today I have
not even gotten out of bed I edited the
vlog this morning and I went back to
sleep it's almost 6 o'clock p.m. I
haven't done anything my mom and dad
just showed up to have a little cookout
barbecue actually it's just throwing
stuff on the grill nothing fancy but is
it so we're starting our day right here
um I'm freaking beat baby that's awesome
is it stinky yeah I'll take a ride yeah
so they always brings the cool stuff
over he's got a serious frickin smoke
bomb right here almost a million cubic
feet of smoke got to see it to believe
it
oh it's on it's on
I've waited three years to light this
thing freely yeah there we go
ha ha ha Wow Wow that's a serious mug
it's thick
what in the world is that shoots out
mini smoke bomb oh you'd better do more
than that
ah what a crock
hey little racecar hey alright guys so
instead of doing stuff to make you think
that my life is exciting when it's just
some days it's just not it's just a
normal day with this little if there is
no normal day with this kid mm-hmm so
we're gonna do some QA I just put on
Twitter ask me questions and I'm going
to answer them so instead of just being
sick and not vlogging all day I'm going
to at least do some Q&A for you guys so
here we go
I'll see if I can get through this
without Caine interrupting a million
times ok what's the least favorite prank
you've ever done it would be my Jurassic
prank with the dinosaur even though it's
an awesome prank I hated every second of
it it was miserable the thing weighed
like 60 pounds and you can only meet
between Dennis and I we could only stay
in it about five five five minutes at it
this is gonna be tough in every time and
you couldn't just get out of the
dinosaur you had to like back it up into
this rack and like two people or one
person would have to hook it into this
rack it was a nightmare even though the
video did amazing on YouTube - good ok
this is an interesting question what's
the worst part about making a movie it's
crazy that there actually is a worse
part about making them
Hey Dude yeah it's all about hitting you
guys and kicking you guys lately I
haven't seen some comments that it was
like I'm really offended that canes
always hitting and kicking us oh okay
you know so the bad parts about making a
movie at least from my standpoint of
being a youtuber is the legal the legal
end of it it's so tedious
Enda ha do you want to hear all that
no so the legal part of it the details
the amount of people it takes to make
sure that each prank we pull off isn't
gonna end up um you know we're gonna get
what we're gonna get sued or you know I
don't know there's a million I like two
months into the movie I was like I'm
just sticking at YouTube is this is
crazy this is too much
no matter how I'm no matter how tough
like those things are it's gonna sound
crazy to you guys that there's a bad
part about making movie number one is
like not only the legal part but being
away from my family so much it's like
it's like back and forth la ohio la ohio
now our family's moving to LA and like a
week is here hey can you guys get to
hear this whole but it is the next step
in my career is film possibly TV who
knows I mean that's the next step out of
YouTube so you have to eventually make
that leap into into um you know the next
steps and that is making a movie
so I I got really no complaints honestly
it's all good problems I'm not
complaining I just let you guys know
that there are parts that aren't
necessarily like fun like making pranks
for YouTube is just fun every day that's
what I love there's some things about a
movie that's that almost comes off is
it's tough it's hard it's whatever you
guys I want to hear about that I know
you're I know you're adorable and you're
cute and you steal the show and every
vlog but daddy has to do
let's go hide in the closet to do this
vlog for you guys there we go Rhea yeah
so have you ever considered possibly
have you considered or possibly
considered permanently moving to LA I
thought about a million times every
single time it's the same exact answer
and that is no now we love LA LA is
great but it's just not home to me it
feels like um another planet like
another planet honestly if you could
prank with anybody dead or alive who I
don't know if this even falls into like
category of like pranks but I've always
had like I would probably only be
starstruck by two people in my life
that's Adam Sandler if I could ever do
even stand beside him and my vlog would
be like the highlight of my I don't
think so I don't know if I have and
number two would be mmm like if I ever
met Eminem I I honestly never been
starstruck I don't even think it would
ever happen but those two people to me
would probably like catch me off guard
I'd just be like it would be crazy I
don't know what about you honey
rut Ryan Gosling this is a really good
question everybody asks me this everyone
from the business side all the way to
fans and that is how do you balance work
and family life that's an awesome
question it's very difficult and
challenging but you have to have first
of all you have to have an awesome team
like Britney and I we're a team and we
do everything together whether we're
apart or in the same room we're still
working on everything together it's very
tough a lot of people can't do that and
I'm just trying the best to do that and
you guys hear this just a little monster
now I think he went from that cute
little kid that you guys know to like
hurricane hurricane that's gonna be is
it's gonna be his wrestling name
hurricane happy really not okay
yeah every single second with this kid
is just surprised is that your song I
love I think everybody loves it yeah
you're killing me kid okay
what's the most romantic thing you've
ever done for Britney hmm I think one of
the most romantic things I ever did just
pick my nose and run you know when we
when we first when we went on our first
date I picked her up and all I had was
this white work van like the ladder
racks on top okay had a cage in the back
and that was my only vehicle that I
owned so I actually picked her up for
Apple we went to Applebee's I picked her
up she actually got in this van with me
you must have really liked me and
obviously I don't know what romantic
means cuz that was 100% opposite of
romantic who's your favorite superhero
my dad my dad's my favorite superhero
you ever cried during a movie I wouldn't
say I've ever cried but I cannot watch
the movie up like the first 10 15
minutes that movie is ridiculous I don't
care how many they should take the
toughest guys in the whole world put
them in a room and put that movie on and
just watch them weep it's the best worst
movie I'm okay everybody's worrying
about Zeus when we leave for LA who's
gonna take care of Zeus there's actually
a lot of questions about that it's
simple as you guys know when I leave
town or bring in the kids leave town we
have family actually live at our house
so the house is never empty they're
always everything's taken care of the
fish the dog everything's covered so
there's no worry about the animals this
will be in good hands how do I not feel
weird about like when I vlog in front of
people in public strangers
it's a great question actually I feel
weird all the time it's something that
never goes away you just have to like
realize I am talking to a lot of people
it's not like I do look crazy I always
feel like I'm talking to myself but but
no it's something you just have to like
if you really can't care what people
think that's that's the real answer
right there who cares you may never see
that person again the rest of your life
who cares what they think I look stupid
doing this who cares like that's that's
what I have to tell myself all the time
who cares yeah yeah if you care what
people think this really isn't the the
right business for you specially doing
pranks so you can't you can't worry what
people think a lot a lot of questions
about Noah coming to LA yes he's coming
actually work sucks he's actually stolen
summer break for another month plus so
he'll have almost a solid month more
than a solid month in LA with us so it's
gonna be perfect it's great I know we've
been asked this before but would you
ever consider having another child
if yes boy or girl why Britney wants to
have another girl I wanna have one more
care of it no you want to have a girl
did I say another okay
no Britney once never girl I don't know
what I mean I got two boys now so yeah
this is my life guys this is this is the
life of this crazy prankster that you
think you know this is what I'm really
doing so we are actually um ya know we
both want one more kid and I don't know
when that's gonna happen healthy boy
yeah boy or girl will be happy the way
that's that's the truth um has anyone
ever caught you playing board games nope

thought about making a prank with
Britney if so any ideas we actually have
