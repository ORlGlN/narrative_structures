always hate the part of vlogging
traveling because it's it's kind of
repetitive we do it a lot I'm always
trying uh how do you remember I'm saying
it's something about being repetitive in
the same vlogs and traveling and blah
blah blah I tried it I try to just film
and do the best I can but it really is
the same thing over and over so we're on
the move let's do it American or Delta
this one is you getting distracted
pushing this little monkey around he
wants it up there is it r2d2 which is
are you sure does look like him
traveling on planes is a lot like taking
road trips you always stop you get
snacks you get drinks I am five days
there's my fifth day with no energy
drinks but getting sweet tea which
probably is just as bad right just not
sugar what's he has caffeine in it well
natural I don't know it's all bad it's
oh I wanna I need it I need it I see
they put it right in your face and your
brain is literally hijacked it's like
it's like you have to have it it's a
drug man mm-hmm
Here I am preaching about sugars I'm
most unhealthy person all right let's
get out of here this is really rare guys
