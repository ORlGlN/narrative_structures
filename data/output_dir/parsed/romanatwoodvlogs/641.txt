the airport it was a quick trip to the
city st. Louis is beautiful I absolutely
fell in love with the city people are
awesome cane I love you I'll see I'll
show you when I get home okay
it's done for extra anxiety we're
running late now we're not late yeah

check-out one final goodbye to this
beautiful city I love it here I feel
like I'm home like people are awesome
here sure you don't go to the pool I do
want to know who so we are out I'm gonna
try to vlog a little more than usual on
our travel vlogs today because I know
I'm gonna get home and be like crap I
didn't film anything so let's go little
raw today let's just go raw we're taking
our smile more chocolate that they made
us we put it in a bagging we're taking
it for cane cuz he really wants it I
showed it to and he's like oh hopefully
it makes it one piece I don't know do my
leg hey I'm gonna take your note I was
thinking about it Roman and Brit forever
hello hello how are you
haha this was a really fun trip but like
all trips they got to come to an end
we're we are headed back I miss my kids
man you have kids yes I have six kids
six kids whoo you've been working you've
been put in overtime
I love traveling I love flying I love
being on planes like I'm comfortable I
sleep good but what I hate is security
going through security so tedious and
time-consuming you got to take off your
shoes you got to get a free massage
here's that free massage she's been one
how was that how's it look pretty frisky
you guys room she's getting the
deep-tissue Britney literally just
reminded me we didn't get magnets in st.
Louis so good call up what's wrong
oh that is cool I don't know I can't
decide I kind of like this little gold
one just case there's anyone new to the
channel we collect a magnet every city
we go to and then we hang it on a board
so this is a new one we haven't been
here
- two times to the airport this week not
running late we're actually on time -
chill we can get a bite to eat
which makes life so much easier let me
because we had to check out of their
time yeah that's exactly the only reason
we're here is because the hotel kicked
us out for checkout time alright they
didn't have what we wanted actually they
had like three things on their menu
one of which sounded good but mmm
pretzels want pretzels I think Brittany
and I could live on pretzels and cheese
like that's one of our favorite things
in the world just warm pretzels salted
with cheese very long we could eat at
the candy shop let you lick my lollipop
boy
perfect thank you all right picky picky
we gotta have a full meal because
anybody else in the world cut up their
salad like Brittany does she literally
cuts it in the lines he
killing something here what are these
enchiladas chicken good
let me filled up my so much energy on a
plane now that we're done eating it's
time to get something healthy what in
the world why do we have this many
choices oh my gosh that's Claire you
imagine what Cain would do with that
like just leave him in a room put a
GoPro on and see what happens no
he's kicking us out should not mean
you're awesome you're great all right
what did we walk out of there with
reasons chocolate-caramel stuff sprees
the heck is that
that's not like in high school you guys
know I love coconut so I found this 60%
chocolate cocoa covered and let me try
this again this is coconut pineapple
covered in chocolate that's exactly what
it is
okay
ah really good no Brittany got grandma
mama some mom she lose chocolates that
is all the different little she's gonna
love it so it probably seems like we're
just like warping right onto our plan
we've been sitting here for three hours

crazy everybody's tweeting like you're
so bored
