check it for always wearing these in the
blogs so steve-o beat us here with
somebody
what's up man welcome cool I alright
Steve Mostyn know how to juggle which I
mean I think I think we're gonna have in
like five minutes again generally just
here I be catchin we just want strong
time okay so this is good for me too cuz
you guys know I love the juggle but I
never learned how to properly just walk
that's great it's just timing and so
that's all I want to worry about right
and yeah you're on fire my combo now
that this sock design ah
Judy do it again can you keep doing that
you're so ahead of schedule
it's amazing okay but let's get that
let's get that second one up high to
turn three through this one first
once you throw this one then now just
back then when you throw that one first
it was a bad way to explain
this my first three balls this is the
tough one
okay this one goes out haha same before
yeah okay it's the same thing you did
yeah quick turn on friend genes keyboard
member and that's it revolution yeah
oh you're so naturally talented just
once you just keep going keep doing he
or 62 but when you lose grown up t you
have to get fake teeth
you're lucky cuz yours are gonna grow
back yeah I didn't even do that well hey
that's awesome
so I asked him how he lost his teeth
how'd you lose your teeth I do dumb
things
I'm Haley's were teeth right okay so
steve-o came all this way he's actually
in town performing but it came this all
this way he's got this stunt that you've
been doing or tried to do for okay this
is how it works if I the enema see do
she do it let me see what I've seen for
those of you that for those of you that
don't know steve-o is not just a stop
man he is he's graduated from Clown
College he has he has so much history in
doing things like this that I would only
say this is a sniper steve-o right he's
a professional idiot he professional it
is exactly steve-o what he puts a lot oh
yeah like it's very
perfect executed right it's gonna be
perfectly that no pressure
oh you've got it dude and you've taught
my boy to juggle
let's see sixer let's see six throws and
then two revolutions oh yes yes
Oh Jean I've heard that successors right
give any idea what he's doing right now
no he's gonna drop that knife in that
bottle somehow I into the bottle I have
no one was ours do that that's how he
knows where it's gonna land no I get
James we have Windex bottle or anything
yeah fun for the whole family stunts
here we go
I think my knife trick is fun for the
whole family so here's how it works
okay that's pretty long now it's time
for my trick and I'm gonna stick this
knife wait don't worry Brett it'll buff
out
oh I do that why just stick in but you
wanted to also be loose enough that it
finds its straightness with gravity hmm
Bank is right that looks straight I
don't know nothing the idea is
ultimately
I'm going to lay down on the table we're
gonna frame the ceiling so the knife
drops I'm going to catch it in my mouth
okay
it seems safe to me it's harmless secret
about how if you figure out where it's
gonna fall is find the dripping point
uh-huh all right you know you gotta use
catching your mouth the knife yeah we're
good I can use your mouth yeah
okay I mean if you want to line it up
for the water drop oh yeah of course we
got to do that can I call an ambulance
first Wow no okay
don't hundred miles away good so I have
now placed the knife myself into the
ceiling and I will be hitting the
ceiling with the four hammer knocking
the knife into steve-o's mouth do you
