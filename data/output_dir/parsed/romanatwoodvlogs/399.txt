extra fun and crazy so we got a bull a
crazy racetrack
while the kids are outside we're trying
to figure out the best way we got Noah
something that he has been wanting
forever like most kids dream about
having he has never had one before and
this is the year that we did it we're
trying to make it special and even more
fun because he's going to flip when he
gets this gift this is like the greatest
gift he could ever receive which is
crazy which is crazy but that's that's
how it is now this so trying to figure
out a way to make this really fun and
unique or maybe we just throw in lost
line of work or what if I put it right
before we get the cake out I say hey no
we go get that cake out of the fridge
and it's sitting in the fridge unwrapped
a wrapped unwrapped
I want to see him unwrap it yeah I
really want to see him unwrap it ah you
could wrap it or I said hang it from a
tree oh my dad's on the ball I even see
it mom you get up here you haven't done
it I need you there well I know you
think I need so at this point
everybody's just kind of getting here
we're gonna have a really fun day really
hopefully my actual focus is to film for
my memories versus your entertainment I
know that sounds crazy right now I don't
want to offend anybody but it's my boys
12th birthday and there's like so much I
want to remember and he's just growing
up on me and it's making me emotional
all right they get too big too fast that
being said we should have more of a raw
vlog because these are things that I
want to capture for not just me but my
entire family you never know man
hopefully 20 years from now we'll be
able to watch these vlogs and remember
knows 12th birthday and so on so that
does make certain vlogs more special
when I aim for memories versus
entertainment so so I said after an S so
but at the same time if I'm a good
vlogger I should be able to entertain
you at the same time
time time time I'm gonna go and take the
drone up though this should be cool
right

mom

a lot of kids spending the night tonight
so I'm gonna end this edit this start
fresh tomorrow we are on day 30 this is
our 30th vlog in a row which means we've
I think we've done a month straight
pretty much I knew I knew getting know a
phone he's never had a phone before he's
got an iPod which is darn near the same
thing like he has everything but the
ability to call me when he doesn't have
Wi-Fi so basically he's now got a way
that I can call him anytime with my
travels and everything I just feel like
it's time that being said I knew that he
has pretty much given up on hope of
getting a phone so when he got that
phone today I don't think I showed my
reaction but I instantly was just
tearing out like his reaction it broke
me like
I just I guess a lot of kids who care
less if they got an iPhone but I knew
that Noah would break if I got him an
iPhone so I'm glad that I could do that
for him and you know this year was a big
year for us as a family and not required
a lot of sacrifice a lot of time away
from my boy whether I was on tour or
working on projects and that way no
matter where I was your sacrifice that
has to be made and that is time away
from my kids thank you for being here
and being such a huge part of our
memories man you guys are everything to
us you are pushing us to ten million you
are here every day especially at the end
of these vlogs I always think that
nobody's watching like right now I
always feel like I'm talking to my
future so I'm gonna end it you are
