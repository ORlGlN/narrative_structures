okay here's the deal
it is freezing cold outside it is like
rainy ice like it's raining ice mommy's
gone hey what do you do mommy's gone so
it is just me my little boy monster here
it is just me and Kane right now at the
house we came up with right I think we
came up with a pretty good idea to burn
some time have some fun and just hang
out father-son time mister kid yeah it's
pretty disgusting out guys it's like
half sloshed blood half ice snow it's
just weird
press I'm here let me out mana and let
me out there boots
coat is this all you're wearing it's not
that bad let's go we'll go fast
not without holes we don't really need a
full jacket Oh or two frozen they're
melting look look at our yard dude it is
nasty you sure like the four-wheeler out
do some mud running pretty interesting
idea today we've never done it in the
vlogs and maybe it could work out Oh
awesome dude we got a hotdog raft but
this snows gone so let's get some lights
on let's see what we got here cheesie's
I mean I agree I think that uh I mean we
have plenty we have here at the swamp
we're in this cycles all's we have we
have tons of boxes always tons of boxes
come on in Zeus come on in and I think
for a nice indoor day this could provide
a lot of entertainment for the kid
so we get boxes from everywhere
different companies send its different
boxes so I'm trying to match up the
boxes to make the perfect box for flex
four right okay why don't we take these
inside you take tape gun I'll get the
boxes that's a deal just the time that
we got them boxes flash are you good
in just that amount of time you rob the
toilet paper rack how do you do it so
fast tape him to the wall cane tape the
dog to the wall he's like I'm out of
here
I'll take in my toilet paper and I'm
gone this year for Christmas somebody's
getting a new husky how's that sound
who wants a new husky imagine selling
our dog like what it would be like oh
great dog never gets into trouble okay
grab a box so let's start off by just
putting some of these together all right
we're gonna tape them together make them
together mountain together zip zip
rip rip ah we use the boxes that we have
should we go this way always or wad
here's a fun fact for you I actually
worked in the shipping department of the
Rope factory for many many years so I
have used one of these for years I used
to take boxes all day long clothes on
ship on FedEx UPS Freight that's all I
did
that's just a weird little fact a lot of
people don't actually know that I this
so basically what we're going to do
canes recording for me we're gonna start
taping boxes together like this Shawn
and we're gonna build giant box tunnels
through the house cool
yeah hey
we're going to put this inside this have
another idea
I think really cool the only way we can
keep it from tipping is if we cut a hole
out of the side and start building a
tunnel this way that'll help it we get
you in there whoa doodoo duty to edit it
Kane hey we need more boxes dude I know
you having fun just drilling the holes
in that box but we got a fort to build
this is where we're at so far pretty
cool actually I love it
it's just goofy enough man we got to
keep building it though what's up dudes
oh yeah didn't take him long to find
that there tufted food ice bowling
what's up bro
Oh bowling I Spence well I I wanted it
much bigger by the time they got here
but this is where Zeus come on Josh come
here
Zeus come on go get it in the box
get your ball get your ball Zeus oh he's
going he's going he didn't hit it he got
it go get his ooze and the boss inside
inside good boy okay oh hi are you going
straight yeah he's in the ventilation
just come on come on boy oh that's funny
water good Bogut is Zeus inside inside
are you in there kid she's packing all
the way out huh good boy Zeus where's
your ball okay got a little distracted
Dale came kids came I think we're gonna
head over to his house for a little bit
and uh Kane I think we're gonna have to
add to this I don't think we should take
it down maybe wax it send it outside
put it up oh and the snow would be
awesome Oh snow for ya we put this
outside right before it does snow and
then you'll have snow tunnels say cheese
I feel like I'm in one of the movies
where they're crawling through the AC
ducts huh okay okay I'm over the room
