also thought what could I do to actually
get them from not playing video games
like what could I do outside to make
them go I want to do that and they hop
off the games that's what I'm doing
right now I'm gonna rig up a couple
things charge some batteries up here

all these toys all these toys and apples
frozen so I wish the pond whispers it's
not even close

seasoned trampoline have stolen away
game time which I'm not gonna lie I did
not think I did not think it would be
this easy
oh yeah cause if you land wrong you're
slipping hard boy Oh kind of worked yeah
I'm gonna go see the pond temperature
real quick it's gotta be dropping when I
start country jumped in it was 40
degrees and now the edges are starting
to turn the fountain off the edges are
starting to freeze but the aerators are
still on which means there's a lot of
water movement in the pond meaning it's
very hard to freeze but it's cold the
water is gorgeous beautiful we are at a
whopping let's see here
38 just below 38 degrees which would be
I guess like to one-and-a-half Celsius I
don't know how that works it's crazy I
literally only know Fahrenheit I don't
know Celsius though not cold enough to
freeze periods gotta be 32 fahrenheit to
prove The Adventures of Donkey and flash

were kids it looks like sloppy joe but
it's like rice seasoning meat sauce and
then you dump Fritos in it so it's like
chips and salt and I don't know what it
is but it is ridiculous and the reason
the family stopped making it is because
it was you up kaboom

actually doing so I'm about to dig in
there money been eating this I'm gonna
eat it and it's sat for two days so you
