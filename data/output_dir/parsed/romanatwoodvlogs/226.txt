probably yeah no case you're all gonna
burn so I don't know wow what a day this
is going to be baby's coming pretty soon
guys and we have to prepare and be ready
cuz we need to test this out make sure
it first holds the air second holds warm
water got to fill this up with um like
bath water basically but not hot like a
nice warm what
not tonight I just mean like let's see
the whole dare for the next day or two
and then just uh I guess oh yeah it's
like a hose that goes from the same sink
no but it's like a hose you turn it on
and just runs like this full of water so
it's also got this liner which we really
screwed up because it says you should
put the liner on before we blow it up in
other words the liner won't go on once
it's full size we have to deflate it and
redo it I feel like you don't need the
liner it's the one time use I don't
think we need it yeah you don't need it
you don't need it never we get nobody

weird imagine having something that you
want so bad right in front of you right
there all the time right there like it

can't hold her is it so I don't know I'm
excited I can't wait to meet you little
girl I'm having a serious talk here Kane
like it's easy to talk about right now
but we took like go time and we're
filling that thing up warm water and
it's like baby time so that I feel like
the last thing I think about is this
camera like I'm so nervous like
obviously I want to be in the moment and
have this baby safe and all of that
there's another part that we have like
try to document I think it's really
important for the family for that girl
having that imagine you have or maybe
you don't want to see it I don't know I
don't know we're trying to figure that
out but I think would be really cool if
I had like my birth on camera you know I
mean not the birth but like that day and
my parents faces and money like I want
to capture that for our girl
we didn't do it Kane didn't do it with
Noah it's like this is her critical
thing that she gets documentation I
don't know thinking out loud here
thinking out loud I want to do that but
I just feel like it to be the last thing
I'm thinking about is this camera mmm
