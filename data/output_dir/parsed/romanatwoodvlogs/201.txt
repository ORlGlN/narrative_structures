what is happening on our day today no
it's just here's the biggest problem we
can go without power
like that's just normal lightly we can
still have fun we can do everything we
want to do but the fishtank super super
expensive super valuable cannot go
without power that generator is mainly
to keep that tank running if it's not
running it is super bad there's no
oxygen being put in the tank and there's
everything in that tank is alive that is
a live coral reef good news is Dale says
he has a little so dark in here already
what would be really bad is if I went
into labor
no this would use any water anything
either you really really really don't
say that it'd be like the olden days I
will just go on the wood okay so Dale
says he has a small generator that will
be enough to power at least one pump in
the fish tank and that's that will work
for a few hours and hopefully we get
power but you need a little boy it won't
get you it's child safety so I gotta run
the Dale's I gotta run to dad's you guys
