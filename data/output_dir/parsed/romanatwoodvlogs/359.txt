money on a tree together the tree that
we had in our old house the small short
tree my gram-gram bought me and she
bought it over the summer and yard sale
for $1 and that was our tree until we
moved here and then when we moved here
the people that had recently owned the
house left their big 12-foot tree so
we've been using theirs so this is the
first year we've ever spent money on a
tree together and it was pretty crazy
