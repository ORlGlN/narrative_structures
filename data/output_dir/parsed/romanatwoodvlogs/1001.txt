guess who's back back back back again
man you ready to work yes ready to work
what's up Paul are you doing it finally
man yeah I'm sure you most of you some
of you voted for him early in the
competition so much think of all the
villains so you're watching saw soldiers
bro Roman soldiers hey hey you ready to
craft uh yeah let's go okay so we got
our campuses and some paints and letters
you ready yeah so the first one we're
gonna do we're gonna do a small Vaughn
for a giveaway so you guys will be able
to win it not sure how yet we don't know
if we should do like our against Graham
Twitter or something like that or just
like a vlog comment I'm not sure what
what will be easier there's a couple
ways you guys can do this if you want to
make something like this at home it's
really easy even if you don't have a
canvas you can get like a poster board
or paper or whatever we got letters um
just like poster board letter so it
would be like nice and neat and even you
can get tape I might have to tape the
big one because the letters might not be
big enough but you can tape out and like
you know draw your letters with tape
tape it out so we're going to cut out
all the stickers and put those on first
I cut out each letter before I stick it
on the letters actually suck down some
of them aren't sticking very well so
hopefully hopefully this works okay
I think it will here we got a laundry
basket in a sweatshirt let's see
mommy's going to start painting around
the letters if you want to start
painting up here
okay so it's done just wild crazy colors
Cain left me like halfway through it's
pretty cool so we're going to wait for
it to dry and then peel the letters off
I'm excited to see like what it looks
like
till then Cain still playing his game
trying to get all our laundry washed you
know the really fun stuff that you have
to do isn't at all job okay so who wants
it
and once I smile more painting maybe we
should sign the back of it should we
sign the back of it no you don't want to
sign it now hey soos one lucky winners
gonna get this cool painting this whole
ability is nothing but editors for
