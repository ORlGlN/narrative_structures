I didn't do it that's that's the crazy
part I didn't do this - he's fine but
basically after the tornado hit and it
tore all this out the wall everything we
just decided to block this up fill it in
with dirt
by the way tornado never hit this is
just part of like the construction of
this friggin house that's our gas line
right there wait really is that what
yellow means is gas ucomfy flash how are
you down boss how do you know it's a
weird day by the way it's like cool
chilly it's cloudy I don't know why for
me anything
this place is trust
so yeah this you
to be our basement door you see a
walk-in door we're basically taking this
all out everything is coming out this is
going to be filled and leveled with dirt
and what's that called shaped back down
because no matter what we do the drain
fills with mud and then the water rushes
into the basement trust me we've tried a
lot of things we've had companies come
and fix it and it has worked for a while
but it's just time we're going to finish
it close it
pilot we don't use the door anyway ever
never almost never anymore when smile
more used to be down there we used it
every day but now we just have no use
for it so goodbye and they poked a hole
in it now even if we did use it was just
mud yeah it was wrong you'd only use it

almost just ate it probably not
the appropriate thing to talk about but
apparently when girls are pricked I
remember like being back in high school
girls always like if you tickle them
they say they're going to pee right
that's like the girl thing
not the same thing I know but I'm saying
like when you're pregnant she says she
always is about to pee her pants I love
it's true that's why she wears diapers

gotta go I love you okay hanging out mr.
ice cream there I tell you we can play
Lego game with me or my unemployed Lego
game by myself have fun guys crazy crazy
guys I tell you man I'm gonna be honest
this is going to be the realest thing
I've ever said to you guys once you get
to a certain point business-wise
financially no matter what no matter how
high you think you can get eventually
the hardest thing for you to get is time
time becomes the hardest thing to get
right now you may be saying man I just
wish I had so much money I wish I had
infinite money once you get any type of
money I promise you that time will
become the problem not the money because
once you have the money most likely
you're so busy that you can't see
straight I know if I sounds crazy right
now but it's true guys you know me if
you watch my videos like I've been
completely broke I've had no money I've
come into some money now and now I don't
have time time is so expensive it's so
valuable ah what I'm doing right now
over the last few weeks I'm building a
team I'm hiring a team of team of people
to do lots of crazy things and build a
lot of cool stuff I am going basically
friend a friend right now to offer them
jobs before I outsource and give my
friends and family money before I give
people I don't know money so that's what
I'm doing when I say now I mean I've
been doing this for quite some time

in there yes for 80 pounds in hey what
