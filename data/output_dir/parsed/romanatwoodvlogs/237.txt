beautiful
it's Sunday mom and dad might come over
it's gonna be a very great hangout and
you know when sun's out here we get we
get extra excited for some reason what's
that would you say I think so yeah hey
dude there's a horse on your head just
just saying you want me to drive I can
drive I can drive
yeah I got you let me drive for 101 time
you know with her being pregnant she's
even more carsick which is the reason
she drives most the time and then I vlog
but yes sir
Kane was he with you Cain's not in here
welcome back welcome car Empire's happy
your own so jealous
teemo's jealous dog ever
there's a little tiny one
I can totally see it come on little baby
show your whoa she's going crazy right
now okay guys so we're back home and
we're just gonna get right to it I got
this idea today I actually came up with
it today I'm gonna need this today fly
home this idea I don't know if it's been
done before maybe it has made me a
husband but we're gonna do it I gotta
charge up a bunch of these giant bat lay
this thing massive this is what my
normal RC steak this is what the big guy
takes you want to do this with me huh
you wonder with me you wanna do it I've
already told you it has to do with a
rope and a chair with wheels cuz we need
a big truck are you in or are you out
two questions all right here we go
charging up we can go get the stuff
let's go get it
let's go all right if you guys watch
back in the winter this is the actual
truck that pulled the kids on the sleds
in the snow it's a beast it's a real
beast but I actually I actually had a
box of shotgun shells on top of it for
weight because the tires would slide on
the ice of course in the winter time
flash hadn't already eaten the knob off
my remote so that's new out to the smile
more store hey which chair can we take
this one this one this one this one or
the most dangerous for daddy this one
but you know you can't joke on the vlog
people take this serious every word is
it serious
only this one looks alone alright we'll
take the old one I'm kidding do you want
the back support oh yeah you know what
that's probably good idea you know
safety is always an issue so yeah let's
get backs worse it's a lumbar right
there
actually bless you yeah baby take me
right here we got it yeah it's pretty
Rollie pollie man I think I think we'll
be able to pull that right yeah
are you ready to rig this up I think it
almost needs to be a pole not a rope
because if I slow down the chairs just
gonna smash into the truck maybe we just
do circles maybe that's the if we just
do circles you'll never we're gonna
figure this out together guys
uh how much you think we need see it's
pretty good right
boom I don't want to change the mood of
this vlog but it still kills me to see
Zeus's teeth marks and all my trucks man
like he's in that thing bodies why is it
so heavy all right guys we got the truck
rigged up and yeah I think I think she's
ready batteries already I'm plugging in
just see how this works
get it get it all Jeezy's he's he's
going for the gust up oh you ready I'm
ready if she goes here we go feet up
action oh yeah
all right she's give it a little like
let the Rope get tight and then just
slowly oh my gosh I could drive myself
yeah
that is awesome that is so fun
hey mom oh you're just in time I'm gonna
take a ride on the mom over spicy car
she got you got it no problem no problem
you want to do it you're a good sport
mobile I try everything
yeah that's a good idea here you go now
you're in control you're in command
you're the command center nice and slow
cuz it gets going fast with your weight
it's so funny you're like riding
sideways with it oh hang on hang on hang
on hang on hang on we got a serious
serious entanglement here dude oh I'm so
funny-looking hey you go there you go
you got it see ya be back by dark all
right I'm a short drive myself around I
don't know
my mom and dad I just got here what's up
pops
hey hey you ready take a ride on the RC
truck it's pretty fun actually I mean it
pulls me and I'm pretty buff really it
does yeah
I think you're having a little too much
fun with this today way more fun than
anybody else right now even the kids are
like yeah we're kind of done I'm like
let's keep going I think this is how you
want to do it like you think you can
really focus like that we're talking
about what this is real stuff guys we're

while we um we didn't last time I'm no
sugar tire you know I did make it my
longest yet 12 days strict 13 days kind

couldn't do it any longer it's so hard
guys to eat so healthy like even just
cutting out something like sugars so
difficult so back on that macaroni salad
cheeseburgers and a little fork dang
what you know is anything say more
refreshing than a mason jar full ice
water or lemonade there's there's
something you think it's hillbilly or do
you think it's like refreshing like to
me when I like want ice water on my old
we have a mason jar anyway that's some
dinnertime talk for you

with food you almost done I'm about to
show you something that me and my
brother Dale did growing up all the time
this is you think has to do with dessert

gonna be torture we did this to the
extreme with no exceptions we lived by
this rule all right do you know how you
eat a popsicle like this right you cut
the top off and you enjoy it right let
me show you how me and Dale did it
whatever was connected was our popsicle
see we'll just go with that what we
would do this is true in the popsicles
and we were kids same company bigger
popsicles they've gotten smaller
they've gotten thinner they were bigger
now maybe they were I don't know they
look like they were popsicle he's gonna
have a whole aah
this is education for them I wasn't King
this is not 3 2 and honestly all the
time all night we would grab the stack
it wasn't always what was connected but
it was like five six connection you
slice the top off the whole thing and
then you just sit there eating them one
by one
seriously I know some of you guys do the
same thing know what - to be fair yeah
Thank You wack you

some Call of Duty you roasting their
potatoes Cain you never know if you're
getting killed by a five-year-old when
you play this game I bet every time I'm
getting roasted it's probably by like a
little kid I bet I gotta ask your
favorite question ever are you ready for
this game do you want to take a bath or
a shower cuz you got a pick
really maybe five because I thought
you're gonna freak out the reason I
asked it on camera is because sometimes
I don't know kids hate taking baths and
showers sometimes sometimes it's like
the most exciting thing ever a new toy
or something you want to get in the
bathtub you do you don't know that's why
I asked it on camera because I thought
you were gonna you were gonna give me
some type of resistance but maybe maybe
you guys just make it really easy I'm
just gonna start asking you on camera
all the time okay that you know what
that means we got to go get in the back
why is the couch starting to look like
an electronics store what's going on
over here
so I eat on the couch
flash why you getting on the couch this
place is out of control just bulldoze it
I'm gonna go get the caterpillar we're
gonna bulldoze this place it's done it's
over Walt look at the sky tonight yo
we're getting some beautiful skies guys

worlds on fire man look look at all this

fire that's creating that yes I'm not no
mad scientist but I know a thing or two
about astronomy yeah like that is the
stomach hey you know it's bath time you
can't hide in the toilet paper you said
you wanted to take a bath see this is
the real part this is the part I wanted
you guys to see you can't hide from me
you can't hide from me yeah so guys

cool stuff for you guys I promise and
it's all coming together but there's
just a bunch of build-up to it and uh
it's hurry up and wait it's like you

better be here now so what's your give
me your best idea did this one is gonna
break the internet it's gonna destroy it
so which server is going down pizza with
three exclamation points that's how
seriously that's like a title on my wall
I know dude but we're talking about like
the green
celery especially the way the tree line
falls down I mean what kind of apricot
tree would that fall into I think we're
talking about what's dependent on the
symmetry of the solar system like if if
the stars are aligned and the celery is
going to fall north-south about the
place where the moon all right the
gravity from the moon is going to pull
that east-west will gonna be ducks
though like and your accuracy the
strawberries well the sellers got like
my veins and give me a veins like
strings right puppet monster oh if we
want celery wind strawberry
we're gonna have to shoot in the fall

ripe until what July at best so what's
yours yeah yeah heavy frost uh frosty
