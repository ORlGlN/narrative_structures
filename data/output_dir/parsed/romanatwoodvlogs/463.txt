the entire world

freaking zombie right now we just got
one hour massages both of us and I feel
like gummy bear dude no I think I
thought she said my shoulders and neck
were so bad she wants to see me again
before I go on tour which is like less
than a week one week if you never went
got a massage I recommend it man it
makes you feel so much better and not
only that you actually have knots in
your back then they can work out
specially if you ride bike skateboard
you do activities mine was from falling
on Dale's parachute crack instantly a
man just myself on my side so it just
kills my now you hang from the ceiling
like a bat it would actually probably be
really good on my back I think that
happen I actually have no idea what
we're doing today Brittany has planned a
date day we have a date today and she
planned it and I have no idea what we're
doing
no hands okay and we can film it and
everything like that
Bailey she can tell me where to go I
have no idea where we're going which is
kind of fun it's kind of a mystery we
need to go from why don't you tell me

things to do today one is go-karting

time we're like country people wait I
don't know if I lock my car I didn't
even get my keys
I didn't get my key oh it's not locked
that could have been so bad
whoo new cars make it difficult to lock
your own keys in your car but I hate
doing that I've done it before
busted I got you
I was checking to see fans uh-huh we're
gonna eat a little place downtown we
used to go called the elevator I love
this place really cool they're the ones

that's like that is the meanest thing no
you know before you guys got here I said
I said let's hide the Karen talk like we
were me like not too mean and she does
bid if she what she was gonna be I was
like I don't know how to react oh that's

sit outside I get yeah it's nice up no
yes

playing two things today I guess what
the second one was I'm excited she
thought it was I was not gonna be
excited I think it sounds great so I get
the go-cart track maybe just I get the
go-kart track baseball this is always a
fun date night fun time for the family
we run about like sports I don't even
really watch baseball but it's fun
you think you could throw this fast
here's what I learned about baseball so
far nobody comes here to watch the game
everyone comes here to eat drink and
hang out like it's a social event really
I'm watching everybody in drag I had a
Gatorade I'm getting ice cream
that's why yeah yes the baseball games
we just come to eat drink oh my god what
are you gonna do Oh scrub it in Oh rub
it in some people flip out when they
drop stuff on them I've never done that
I just wipe it rub it are you afraid my
friends would have to leave right now
like change
friends that was awesome
we had a good time what is your favorite
sport to watch like live Britney said
baseball I really like baseball
I would six keys probably number two
hockey yeah I would say football just
because there's so much going on there's
so much action there's always people
hitting people there's so much going on
baseball is like golf
like you have to wait so long for
anything exciting that's my opinion
anyway we had a good time place is still
going we left a little early but that's
how you get out without that's not we're
not we're not sports fan so you leave
early you avoid all the traffic we're
not missing anything you're pretty far
