sup big boy what's so flashable you
didn't want to talk huh I didn't
actually get you a taco but I kind of
feel bad now how are they how are they
I'm a I'm like Brittany what you wanted
me to make you tacos that's just what I
did
handmade Taco Bell is nice enough to
supply wrapping so they'd stay warm my
homemade tacos no here's the real
question is everything in there did I
get it right that I mess up what where
did I go wrong perfect we've had
horrific luck at that particular
drive-through I mean like crazy so if we
got it all that's really good that's a
win
enjoy the homemade tacos baby dude this
a pawn area is turning into such a fun
beautiful I knew it would like I knew it
would that would that was an area of
this house this property that I knew
once it was it was done it was gonna get
so much attention and fun memories are
gonna be made there like I love that
spot so much just matter right on your
Mosquito tat
got to do a couple things out the store
you know what you guys have probably
seen this in the vlog right here but my
bike is stupid ears the problem with
this bike I think all bikes should have
a kick start all of them whether they
are electric or not this one is only
electric start so the battery got
unplugged in my garage that's trickle
charge it got unplugged so now the bike
is dead it's been plugged in here for
like three days and it will not charge
so it's just shot so I gotta go get a
new battery but if it had a kick I could
still drive it I hate that ya know I
think it's a huge fall if you're buying
a dirt bike make sure it has a kick no
matter what even above and beyond
electric start make sure has a kick look
how goodness missed hand like your
little puppy finally I can wipe Oh or
smile more tank what's up dudes I just
keep the lights on them so they're all
sleeping down in the rocks
I'm gonna see someone some guys tank is
ridiculously beautiful I love that
aquarium speaking of the tank our eel
comes back this week if you guys have
been watching a while we had a giant eel
that lives in this tank and he lived
behind the big s he'd actually coils
body up back here he's coming home he's
coming back and Todd said he looks
awesome he's like big and plump now
which is healthy eel and no no heats
room what's up for my let's go back
inside so we had to run out here do a
couple things but Brittany wanted you
guys to know that lanyards because a lot
of you guys asked lanyards are back in
stock if you haven't seen these they're
sweet
is it blues number one blues number one
you're my boy blue yeah so we've got the
lanyards they detach on the top and they
detach the bottom for like your keys and
stuff pretty sweet we got the purple the
yellow the red the blue and some off red
color I don't know it is different I
don't know
but Britney says blues number one you
can tell - there's always they're always
sold out and camo hats are back in stock
right finally how many times are camel
hats back in stock constantly this hat
right here that I wear every single day
is always sold out everyone has a camel
hat no order and it doesn't it doesn't
like um no matter how many we get we
don't get enough and you guys get them
so sorry about that
we're amateur merch owners so we do all
this ourselves all in-house right here
at our house so we're trying our best
but come on three years ago or three
years ago do you know what our company
looked like it was a little tiny couple
buckets in the in the house and now it's
turned into an entire company with our
own Animal Planet fish tank who would
have thought thank you I can have a new
pop so what's going on with these I just
I didn't do it fish tank Todd that's
what also they got putting the buckets
yeah fish tank Todd had an accident when
he was working on this tank he drained
50 gallons of water out of one of the
barrels onto the floor and all rolled
out is all over here so if you noticed
our store is almost all off the ground
every piece of the company is off the
ground pallets plastics fine pallets
everything sits on top of pallets well
if it's our stuff it's on the ground but
everything's raised off the ground it's
like the house is on stilts near the
ocean because if something happened to
this tank or the tanks that run it we
would be out all our March so it'd be
terrible so we've we've learned the hard
way a couple times that's for sure yes
Michelle Cora Cora you want to run this
company one day little girl you want to
take over the smile the smile more
I'm gonna get that smile today I'm will
get that smile today you making daddy
work hard hey daddy's mom I got millions
of people saying daddy can't get a smile
today come on get it I'm gonna hit on
camera she is so sweet in the mornings
so how long do you need out here I just
sit at this desk and hang out with you /
bother you it's crazy even on our off
days we always have work like it's it's
a constant and it's the greatest problem
like I love being busy I love being I
love having work like I always say the
worst thing that that would happen is
that we have no work and I would I would
never want that out I love being I love
having too much work that's a great
problem half so far is working at me you
may take us so you can rock it out knock
it out Cora we want to go back inside
because if you want any of the small
more stuff go to the top link in my
description don't fall for all the fakes
there are so many companies so many
websites ripping our merch and it sucks
we can't even we can't even catch it all
and by the time we catch it they've
already made their sales they've already
I see you guys in public with literally
fake smile more merch and it breaks my
heart because I know you're actually
trying to support us in the movement of
smile more and you're getting you're
getting you're getting hit with all this
fake merch so if you want to actually
support this family in this movement hit
it on our website otherwise you know you
can always report all these fake
websites to me on Twitter or you know we
try our best to it's called policing
when you have a trademark when you own
something it's called policing you
actually have a company I spend tons of
money have companies policing the
internet for our merch but there's no
way to stop I mean all youtubers have
this problem it's crazy especially on
Amazon Amazon's nuts and it's like we
pull like hundreds of pages every month
off Amazon it's just so hard to keep up
with so thank you guys for your loyalty
and support and always knowing and
telling your parents where to get the
actual merch which is in the top link of
this description because sometimes I
a lot of kids tell their parents I want
smile more merch the moms and dads or
whoever's ordering they don't know to go
to Roman Atwood calm they just type and
smile more on Google or Yahoo and it
goes to a bootleg company that rips all
the youtubers March it's it's crazy out
there he's crazy
I thought someone tweeted me that there
was like they were selling snow monster
it's like on the boardwalk somewhere
yeah lots of stores sell armor it's
crazy that's not actually armor so
anyways anyways thank you guys for
everything but you know what we got to
do we got a smile more I have one more
than big signs I think we should do a
giveaway soon like a legit full-size
metal sign I have one extra I think I
think oh I think Dale took it for his
office at work I think my brother my
brother took it because I need three
hanging up in the back okay I can't get
yeah it fits perfect anyways hey also I
forgot to take you got to a country
can't park his bike inside the store

only grass left honey there's a cat
behind you okay so we've come back

bit of time we get Quora a bath a
certain little tub and every time I've
just take Sebastian passes out so she
