not good it's just foo scene I couldn't

to follow me and make my life miserable
eating with fire I'm gonna have a bucket
fired her on the side you can't you
can't just roll up last kid but when he
falls from the ceiling like a shot not
began and then the fire just sprays back
yeah do you also have a part if you
spray the fire any time yes for sure you
have the fire guys there then you have
to devil it in the morning I know it's
pretty squared is what they're going to
demand
like insurance companies already
screaming about a risk of liability that
you make on fire hold dear we'll work
the fire department big conservatives
that will set fire on the audience and
liability this one yeah that's the one
do you still want to do it with the fire
department like you don't look if you
run it's just like I did once a magic
jewel you just have to come in in the
inspector fire in there so we get wear
something that yeah would it be I will
be in full fire suits so when we go up
like we're all in part one 10 seconds
five seconds
what well if you catch part like you're
moving through fire I buddy Bert you
asked me to give it show your son say hi

Kane and I are getting ready to go to
the park it's a nice sunshine day out
finally it's not raining hey we're gonna
go to the park and then meet up with
some of our Ohio friends that came in
town today parking is always sometimes
hard because they do like
street-sweeping where they clean the
sides if you park there you get a ticket
sometimes it's like 30-minute parking
which back there I parked it was like
crap I can't park here we're gonna be
longer than 30 minutes
hi and you have to remember to feed the
meter so we're going to put money in the
meter
this time so we don't get a ticket put
all those right here so we don't get a
ticket this time can you are just so
adorable
good job okay let's see how much time an
hour whoa
and then another good thing to do is
when you do put money in the meter set a
timer on your phone so you don't run out
of time you just cooled nothing's wrong

swag huh
I don't think swag didn't anymore I
should not say swag I'm so like out out

swing alright we out of there what's up
