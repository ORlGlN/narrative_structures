go she's just chugging along now she's
getting so big welcome guys hope you're
having an awesome day it's Friday the
kids are hanging playing Britt she's
ordering raps
she's ordering the rafters like it's
like a boat hanging also I ordered a
bunch of gift cards oh you check these
out okay so this is one of them and look
how big it is it holds like six people I
was like a little cooler and that's
awesome and there's three different
types so basically we can do like teams
or races or we're gonna battle on
basically awesome baby food having a
baby we're always nasty yeah okay so
welcome
we have been mainly chase and I mainly
chase we didn't really realize how
complicated you know fully do you know I
feel like how'd you know and you
wouldn't been so like hey you yeah I
hope you start your twitch account yeah
feel like this is a lot of work dude I
had no idea how much in like moderators
and like you need a team of people work
in this stuff I've been trying to get
you on Twitch for a while now I know why
I did a hundred percent I would never
think ever that would never be as very
complicated and messy but once you
actually get into it literally my stuff
is all set up so all I got to do is sit
down and click start streaming yeah well
yeah well we're not ready for that oh so
where we're at guys yesterday if you
watch your city of long I announced that
I started a twitch account and I mean
very clear my twitch is not gonna be
based on just playing video games might
might we will play video games but my
full intention with which is to yes we
will play video games but each stream we
will have a special guest a big
influencer a friend somebody social
media somebody that owns a big business
and we will we will sit down and hope to
get advice from them in myself and
motivate you push you our streams will
be more
like a podcast something that you can
just listen to you don't necessarily
have to watch the gameplay so that's
what we're trying to do if you and I'm
not even a partner on Twitch yet so like
you can just
I guess follow me yes that's what you do
right follow for now hey by the way
there's like Yuki uh it's like a whole
like I feel like I'm building a like a
website that's what it feels like yes a
website so I'm learning on that I'm
super excited to launch this and by the
way you should our special get like our
first stream who should that guess be
who should that influence would be who
should that be that person that you want
advice from like who do you want to
learn from that's the goal with this so
I think it's a it's a great concept be
fun motivating positive hold herself up
mommy Wow look at you crawl and I love
it so much better than dragging your
body core a good job baby girl that's so
why is it so exciting
I saw her do that today and I was like
soul pumping my good girl hi baby hi

Britney's working on some stuff we
obviously getting a twitch setup is like
priorities we're working on that that's
not like really vlog
kind of skip past that part but she fell
right on her head girl it's hard part
about crawling when the higher you go
the harder the fall
same difference I guess it's tough
learning all this stuff anyone on how to
ride a bike and you fall off learn how
to ride a bike the whole this is the
whole
you fall off the horse you get back up
tight then you know it's got to keep
just keep trucking see I'll keep trying

came down Cain and I just Cain I came
down here off camera and we did a full
like routine workout it was it was just
like for me if there's mind blowing my
little boy just beside me doing
everything I was doing but just lighter

to lock it in yeah yeah that's the Mario
