what's up my friends hella bailed on me
today
look no no he decided to go to his
friend's house instead of going shoot
with Daddy I've got some stuff in the
back oh but I brought a trash bag full
of the plastic balls I don't know it
just seems like they would be good
bright targets to shoot out so uh I
think we can figure something out
look at the size of that building look
at the size of that building that's the
that's the new smile more dawning I was
talking about that earlier building
I gotta wonder who is that building for
like that's unbelievable you know that
right there somebody's dream coming true
right there somebody started probably
with nothing in them they've made it all
the way to that point so keep on
swimming keep on swimming oh this is
awesome dude how close is it to fit it's
close it's a solid chunk of ice it's
gonna cost Aaron we're gonna blow car
windows out man it's perfect it is for
is it still melting you think you want
to go farther in all like in the middle
would be nice yeah we need it deeper all
right let me see that's what she said
this could be the dumbest way to ever
start a vlog right here so we got some
Tara night and we're about to insert it
into this massive cube of ice so dumb
it'll be fine
start this out right here we go one shot
one shot kill your closet shot so I'm
gonna go over here you right over here
that's nice on the Konex
I brought some really fun targets hey
these are great like handguns and stuff
there we go it's like Easter out here
she did a bunch of balls
I think this
that looks nice okay so I got these baby
ones that you shoot with 22s and we're
going to test one out before we blow
something up through it turns out the 22
was it powered enough we only shoot a
thousand feet a second and these require
1,200 feet a second so I'm going to hit
it with my a our Wendy's McDonald's hey
come on all right Todd's gotta hit it
first shot just Wendy's look I want
about roosters look out their wings I
want wings too today no beer could you
drink a lot am i hot or I can fall back
you're all set no big deal
no pressure no pressure no pressure
this is your idea this is it man
hang on hang on see you you can't see it
ya think your little crooked your oh my
god we need something what's we won't
allow it sup Don okay so your idea here
is that this is gonna go flying yeah cuz
the metal is gonna take the shockwave
and project it right up in there but
still let's do it Adam there's nothing
left of them stands that's all you need
to do go grab that thing let's do it
yeah just get something to sit on the
top so goofy yes good that's good trash
cans also full of balls so let's see
what happens this could be a pretty
picture right here oh stop why did it go

that man it's worth it this is this is
our third time setting this damn barrel
up listen this is all this is what's
important right here okay you want my
food I got this oh look look where I'm
hitting yeah I know you're digging it
