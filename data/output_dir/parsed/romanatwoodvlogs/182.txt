well why wouldn't you get it like when
your friend says hey I have a bus do you
want it you definitely take it right

like man want to report it be like to
actually climb out right you guys do a
slip down you get his let's do the flip
that's not can't wait any longer I can't
oh good
oh yeah I want you guys to imagine
country as your bus driver by I think
you'd be an awesome bus driver man
I would but when you open the door
where'd you say like a boy you better
sit down don't make no noise look
straight ahead put your seat belt on and
that's what I want you to do go go go no
that works I would be very very obedient
I give that Kia turn use the lucky man
let's see what if we write that what
else can we do well we can keep this
spark plugs out ah I don't believe
Clifford the Big Red truck will have
more jumping power but I'm going to go
get it out of desperation I don't know
what else to do country we're going to
drive this boss you know that you know
that even if it means you pushing it
from behind while I spear and have fun
I really hope really help flush and all

defeated man what do we do you think we
switched the battery just take the
battery out of this truck battery out

possibilities that we just do it it has
to work right the battery's about that
slightly different we have literally

like that's where it gets weird to like
all your school buses you have yeah all
of the ones I have in my house yo you
guys are getting crazy down here
push it tanner no is it this is it oh oh
oh I think the front tires a lot but we
like to mix it up and just pull it back
I can push it from the back I move the
wood I'm gonna get it out of here foot
we're pushing the school bus out I'm
pushing it out right now gotta get her
out we got to get her out man this we've
done too much get a row and get in there

mode right now isn't she yeah I got her
to Scott oh really yeah
so with back in the day like I remember
like the cool kids right they sat in the
back like the back of the bus was where
the cool kids that right but I feel like
as an adult the front is less bumpy like
you learn like the front actually more
convenient you're on in off bursts pain
is less bumpy
I mean logic kicks in at a certain age
yeah so now that we're all older is it
cooler to be in the front of the bus
that's one thing I think one of us needs
being back being an enemy of hull
systems lock oh here we go oh my god the
steering's so crazy

so happy because I don't know he's gonna
feel when I like brand his GTR into the
lake country the lights are still on the
bus why are the lights still working he
brought the big stuff to get this I bet
