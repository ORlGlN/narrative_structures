day yeah we're so red this is such a
weird blog guys thanks for being here
family's having a great time
I can't believe and say this is the
first time I was playing in the staring
at you guys are
: country folder I have so much to say
about that show but I want to point out
how amazing of a crew that these places
have look at this place it reset so fast
they will have this place where it's
like reset so quick even the guys from
21 plus everybody even the guys from
twenty one pilots shouted out their crew
and how important they are and it's true
like every set this so quick hey guys so
be honest how was it great fantastic
I've so many great things so many great
things it obtained let's take My Little
Giant on you thanks buddy
you saved me the elevator of Wonders get
us all in here gonna make it yeah make
it home there's that train we were
looking at earlier the tracks that's
pretty cool I actually never
there was a fight
I bet on that
fast and I was a responsible dad we can
do
all right we're up and out of here back
to our cars in the back of the bus yeah
so many things that I want to say about
that show a lot of you guys know twenty
one pilots awesome ban fantastic show if
you had a chance to see him go see him
but I want to point out what I took from
the show it was so inspiring to me that
two guys who come from nothing and
sellout Nationwide Arena but then I'm
sitting there thinking Nationwide Arena
holds 18 thousand five hundred people so
here's a screenshot of the show eighteen
thousand five hundred people so when we
upload this video every video gets more
than two million views that's a hundred
and eight nationwide arenas that we
walked out on stage two I saw you pull
up that calculate yeah cuz I was
thinking when we put up a vlog it's like
walking out on stage to 108 arenas is
that crate you don't even know what that
mean you don't even you can't even
fathom the number because I can't either
if we had to walk out on that stage
could you do it what imagine walking out
on the stage they just played on right
instead of uploading the vlog imagine
just walking out on that stage it'd be a
lot different right well that's we're
presenting you guys it's a hundred and
eight of them stadiums minimum I just
got nervous all of a sudden thinking
about that maybe I shut up let's blow
hunter an eight station right you hear
me you guys hear me it's when we put up
this vlog he's a hundred and eight of
them stadiums watching
it's your mom my mom's son she's got all
the subscribers thanks I love you
so yeah I'm leaving the show super
inspired it just you know they are
perfect example I'll just do what you
love to do and watch your stuff get your
seatbelt on boy hope you guys had fun
one of their videos where it showed them
playing like with their family at a
barbecue or something yes just at a park
or something that's where they started
10 people I know
just imagine had they given up after
that show it's always too soon to give
up keep going guys whenever it is that

candy now he's got an infinite supply if
he gave up in the back imagine country

didn't feel like it was kind of like I
don't want to show too much of their
show in case you're gonna see their show

weird about it so I hope I didn't ruin
anything and I hope that you guys
