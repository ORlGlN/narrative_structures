I'm nervous haven't heard anything like
this on my channel before the only
person that seen do this is you and it
was bad it was rough you have a million
views bad yeah that's it it's like low
hey it's bad the reason why I want to do
this is I saw yours it was like one of
the most amazing things
we're aren't we we're challenging
ourselves today to go create not one but
two 360 vlogs full 360 videos here in
New York City I stayed in New York for
this I supposed to be in Washington
today I can't see now we're like no
we're gonna make this happen so it's
crunch time a vlog plus a 360 video all
in one day just do we use these for 360
these are so dangerous for our like sake
of friendship I'm gonna pretend you
never said that yes we're gonna use
these 5050
I'm gonna bust my face dude why am I so
nervous about this you should be they're
not super safe they're not super easy to
ride there are a lot of funds are
roaming there's no doubt it's fun and
there's no doubt if I eat it you guys
are going to kick out of it so can I
catch should I just go full-speed into
them trash bags
we are cruising New York City guys I'm
just getting used to this friggin board
it's so fast yeah so where where are we
right now so this is like the part of
New York City's Chinatown not the cool
part where tourists go this is the
really gross part ha ha ha it's all like
illegal Chinese gambling happens in this
Park right here really yeah nothing like
serious but but that's where a half
that's where that's where I happened
they don't addicted to this thing
whoo thing Casey right now I'm gonna be
honest with you lay it on me I'm really
trusting you right now dude like am I
gonna be sick later this is no joke like
the scariest weirdest part of Chinatown
but it sure isn't even on Google put a
hidden gem with incredible look look how
really no it's we're the only gringos as
far as the eye can see I feel
something's about to happen do you want
to know what y lo means in fact I love
Lila what is it white devil white double
Y devil Lila the wachootoo tribe
all right well Casey's not the only one
that knows about this place place this
back dude really cow hi are you okay
dude what is that get this it's a soup
done right
what is that they're really complicated
to eat okay ready so there's soup inside
look at they look like I'm gonna go
there is no way to actually know what
I'm eating
it tastes good I pulled this out of the
sack we have just finished up lunch and
we are on a mission guys I gotta find a
rubber snake I want to do the first-ever
360 prank very simple rubber snake
bullet you guys can watch whatever you
want we gotta cut through this traffic
no problem
oh my I'm so out of place I live in the
country
oh my god big crack whoo
it's like I need to stop recording but I
don't want to in case I get smacked by a
car I'll be so mad if I miss it
yeah
absolutely ridiculous
I jump in
Roman you gave me such a nice tour of
Ohio I thought I should reciprocate by
showing you New York City case you're
wondering these things top out around 20
22 20
right now I'd say we're going about
doable out that full speed run
Wow he's like this that you realize you
don't need drugs in this world that's
this is the greatest rush you can have
drugs are a gateway to what can be
achieved a high-powered skate it's
unbelievably fun we are already having
one heck of a day like adrenaline filled
fun very fun it's important to remember
and we weren't out riding that's just
transportation it sounds like a mission
for the record in a car that it took
hours yeah we practically we just
cruised through the city like it was
nothing
sorry guys I didn't get hit by car I
know how bad you want to see that and I
kept rolling in case I did what do you
wanted to see that I don't know about
that all right we found a snake he'll be
here in like a 10-15 minute a rubber
snake I think it's gonna be the right
one oh good I'm gonna temp guys to do
the first-ever 360 prank where you can
look around anywhere and watch the plank
that's pretty cool so good think so they
might actually suck cuz I can't control
what you guys see you could just look
around and be like area Romans whatever
why are you so excited cuz you don't
know where I come from do not from
kuwait kuwait 16 hours away this is my
last day and you found us and I found
you hell yeah bring it into you
Britany oh that's amazing thank you you
make the best blog the best pranks okay
Casey has completely pulled through with
a rubber snake and fishing string which
means oh god I'm gonna die which means
we're going to try to pull off the very
first-ever 360 prank I can't imagine the
quality be too good but it should be fun
to try okay so when you're doing pranks
like this you don't want a lot of people
you want steady foot traffic but not a
ton of it so we're gonna set up right
here very first try let's see if this
works we're gonna shoot a 360 so here we
go so first thing that I'm realizing is
that New Yorkers aren't scared of
anything they don't care about the snake
dude there's too much going on to be
scared like there's something jumping
out of every trashcan you know
I don't wanna I don't want to go home a
failure I do feel like I'm failing
tremendously though I might have to pick
this up later this stuff works really
good where I live because nobody's used
to weird things like that good at
playlists man yeah you should do it at
DC I have like plenty of time okay we're
still gonna do the first-ever 360 prank
but it's not gonna happen today I got
some sorry New York
