from Britt another day
woo oh yeah
yogurt cheese it's sandwiches sunflower
seeds I'm digging it oh and you don't
even have to show him they're already
shelled Dale and I are headed up he came
up with this idea the other day I don't
really want to give up the secret right
now but I'm going to let's just tell him
he came up with this idea you know you
guys have seen drone videos where people
drive from headsets or they fly them
from a screen on their controller you
can just you can go wherever you want
well Dale said what if we build that on
to our RC truck so we've got some big RC
trucks back here that was what was in
the box and he found a company that is
going to build us these systems so we
can drive from TV screens in the comfort
of our own house or in our truck and I
can just take off inside Walmart and
imagine I can go anywhere so I'm super
excited about it's gonna be unique these
guys are gonna hopefully let us film a
process and show you guys what exactly
it is that they're doing I don't even
know so Dale's actually been working
with these guys for a long time but
ready-made RC is hooking it up thanks
guys by the way they like invited us up
it's evening and we're ready to have
some fun so show us what you got show us
what we're gonna do today
awesome whoa I guess today we're gonna
set up these summits here look at this
little guy what is this this is the
hellbender to only you strap up your
backpack yeah this is a quad that we
just released I'm leaving tomorrow to
head up to Canada get to go to a race oh
my gosh so Dale and I made a goofy video
of us racing these in our living room
it's a real thing I got no idea oh yeah
I did it yeah that's amazing
yo this is llege I don't even have a
tour bus he's got a whole system going
here
this is Traxxas summit RC truck and it's
a beast I had no idea how big it was
holy cow these guys are gonna build a
camera system on him so basically we can
drive these from a TV screen which is
super cool too man
so we have two two ways of mounting this
we can cut a hole in the front right
here uh-huh
and have the camera underneath there so
it's a little bit protected you'll see
some of the hood right or we can put it
just right here on the hood and you can
have it there I like seeing the hood you
like seeing yeah like we're driving in a
car right awesome yeah we'll do that
plus you're right there'd be protection
for the camera you're gonna roll that
thing this is what we're what we're
getting yeah so these are directional
antennas each one of these and it comes
with a seven inch monitor and a receiver
whoa yeah this is awesome we're like
giant kids this is the candy store right
here every day you guys are loving it I
don't come home with a paycheck nor help
but you're doing what you love so this
is the camera yeah that's the camera
it's a CCD camera with 600 TV lines
cameras don't typically mount to this
they 3d printed just for us these custom
mounts that go up under the truck and
then we'll shoot out of the windshield
sweet this next level epi that was and
then this is your video transmitter I'm
so excited right now
so this is a 15,000 square-foot build
it's huge it goes way back warehouse and
they started in their basement sound
familiar
basement startups I don't know father
have a 15,000 square foot building but
it's pretty cool and then he made like
all these mounts he made for this truck
I don't get it man I even if I had the
machine to make it I would be like oh
okay I would just duct tape it I would
put a piece of tape right there I'm
super excited I'm boiling I'm impressed
like it completely impressed look at the
screens I'm actually more worried that
we're gonna look like sissies like
trying to race out in the cold
well girl would be sitting my living
around in feet up
oh we're in the frame yeah that's sweet
yeah all right warping through a little
time we're gonna test these bad boys out
man please
I would have already totaled it oh wow
are you watching him yeah hit up by the
RV so this is his drone right now that's
crazy
it's I get anything that he can maneuver
through this stuff I guess is good if
you're that good with it all here he's
coming he's coming behind us that's day
okay so we were rolling right now I'm
driving this truck and he said the
screens bouncing because we're inside
there's the hood of the truck coming up
on someone I'm gonna hit this guy trying
to drive this drone got all kinds of
stuff going on people flying drones
behind us on camera all this is sick
this is like a fun house oh you guys
work in a fun house yes we do I can get
really used to this
oh my gosh you pick some up in Rome
sneaking in the bathrooms again you're
the world
let's sit it's actually incredibly easy
I thought it'd be more difficult but the
camera does stay pretty flat yeah thank
you you can see the big huge loser break
eyes that's awesome just stay there
I didn't realize he's flying the drone
he's like follow him I lost him
all now there you are see the light
that's hilarious
you know how these controls work he does
your actually will let William show you
guys there we go
show us what they want us to crash your
stuff so I said I will and they saw our
video so they knew we needed a lesson

antennas in the back and you can drive
them from these TV screens I had to show
Britney and Kane this all hooked up it
is so clear in my house
so it flickered really bad in their
place I guess it's from all the Wi-Fi
signals and all the things but out here
