this state I'm really excited to be
taking you guys along on what should be
a really fun day I'm shooting a video by
myself today I'm going to pick up my
good man Gilroy who's gonna film for me
and I've been wanting to do this video
for a long time we're basically I I play
small games with the homeless and
there's always a prize involves like
pick a hand or tic-tac-toe or just cute
fun entertainment for them and they
leave with a little bit of cash or
something like that so you're coming
along with me for that so let's go just
one be a day ha ha ha

you guys a tour of how this works and I
think that's pretty cool all right man
so this is a brand new screen right
brand new screen and this is our artwork
stick it on there let's take it backward
so when you hold it up to the light like
so yeah here's what we got okay though
with the exposure unit
it's like a big basically a big vacuum
table underneath it a 10,000 watt ball
so just sucked all the life out of it
does this get hot
pull it out

get it wet huh now you just wash all the
ego

goes over to the printer I'll show you
that setting up the design to run your
t-shirts
what's your name man Wes Wes Wes is
putting the shirts on
that's so cool
whoa and then this the heater this
instantly dries it
so every single shirt gets a second
print so you got a base coat and then it
comes over and gets a second coat to
make sure that white stands out really
bright that's right
and then this just makes sure everything
gets dried
