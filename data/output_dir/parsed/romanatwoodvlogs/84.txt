vlog guys we're out the belt today in a
beautiful sunny Ohio freezing cold but
it's beautiful
something got Laurie with us got
sleeping Kane oh he's a spies away haha
Bryan behind us holding all the toys we
got cheese in front of us we are going
to my buddy's Spence's place and he has
a bunch of property and just a fun place
to hang out we brought a bunch of toys
and equipment and like I said let's have
some fun oh I think we ever explained in
the vlogs but maybe we show pictures
today during our production spins rolled
a go-kart as a passenger and just
severed oh it's like a shark attack much
so I got pictures of Spence being hauled
off in a stretcher and his bones are
almost coming out of his scan did
horrible horrible i'll show you guys
pictures so we brought a bunch of toys
quad dirtbike x3 and lots and lots of
other items hey you ready play you
bought your trucks sweet what is that
what is that awfully big arena for that
hamster with it would be good go go go
go go dude you're kicking up dirt you're
kicking up dust yeah that's why here
checking out spins his plays he got all
kinds of cool he got horses he's got
acres got when he's just got everything
for fun stuff for things we brought
today we're gonna do some riding the
suspense has like the best land for
shooting goes all the way up this Ridge
it's super safe that he has some targets
down here in this corner first thing I
brought out I hope that you're gonna
enjoy this is basically a mp5 setup it's
suppressed and I got suppressor ammo so
hoping it will be like it's the most
quiet version of this rifle possible and
I absolutely love this gas give it a
look II just got it that's it boy that's
it boy SWAT team out go go go
gaga god it's so quiet I can't even hear
you shooting it I shot like 50 rounds
that's crazy quiet holy cow
put the muzzle flash a tad
we are out handing out on this beautiful
absolutely do a blinking do a little
test without citing some plate that some
of the rifles that I haven't necessarily
got to really sight and I'll just see
what we get into we got a lot of fun
things lined up today
you guys having lunch back here like a
little picnic picnic in the cat jeez you
guys got a maid back here you ready you
ready here some shoe in keep the windows
up would be nice and cool also warm okay
so we brought I brought the low mp5 kit
daniel defense two to three scarf
sixteen two to three okay that is where
it's two to three with the can cannon
attachment so we can shoot like pop cans
and stuff what it's still peaks all
right this is no suppressor
oh yeah wig difference my ears are
ringing
yeah 22 are like a Red Ryder BB gun with
ten pumps whoa oh my god
whoa okay chase it I like the spot
behind the truck feel safe so satisfying
quick back story he keep he can't shoot
right because of his arm so he's got a
he's got a shoot left oh no I need that
guy right there
yeah I need that guy boom
that's the Barrett that's the mean
machine
he was making an ad for a movie
yeah it's called stuck in the country
and it stars you in and a 50 with no
bullets you have to make bullets out of
wood okay so this is this is a standard
two to three that's what we've been
shooting on most of the day this is what
we're shooting right now that is a 50
BMG Oh cute it is but a Bing won't for a
shot and it's your turn
yeah yeah well I just uh got rattled
back to sixth grade okay so we shot the
fifty but the idea now is to get a ton
of leafs and pile it all around the gun
so that when it blows shoes ha leaves I
don't know anyway well you got them good
least and then a good Leafs are we gonna
make sure we got the right Leafs nuts
the grade of the leaf it's the it's the
way to the leaf it's the feel of the
leaf this is gonna be the greatest shot
I promise Spence tell her are you sure
why when you're ready you just flip that
to fire okay and then once it's at fire
you just pull the trigger I can't reach
you can reach
how was it come on Britt come on
you see down the sights you see yeah
you see the red dot okay come up here
put your head up here so if you want to
look through their sights you can aim at
the metal tins over there okay put your
dot on there pull the trigger
ready ready
are you ready pull pull pull
nice dude we weren't even hitting it
yeah ujong see your dot

stand the winter months where it's dark
