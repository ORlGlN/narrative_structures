on the camera body but this is insane
this is insane these are beautiful guns
like super college it this is mean yeah
there is I really really love lack and
white they call it urban camo I think
yeah it's good and these are they're
anodized so they're not painted so -

yeah who just gets somebody to air
fifteens like it's because I love you
dude this is the hottest paint gun I've

ridiculous as one the coolest go Sam and
it's it it goes all the way to one is
six times right yeah dude that's amazing
man all gotta zoom it all the way dude
Matt these are so sick dude
thank you Anne all right man thanks for
mounting these up for us that's a huge
hell these are beautiful we're gonna get
these out today Matt
yes I'm so excited I'm so pumped for
this not only was this like the most
amazing gift which by the way we have a
really big gift coming for you guys
today
hopefully it delivers so not only did we
get these which is amazing but I got a
grenade launcher and we are really close
to being able to pick up the shells for
them and make they're called like bird
poppers it's not like an explosive
grenade like you're probably thinking
it's it's perlite still be pretty cool
for like cities who have like the birds
that poop all over businesses they'll
fire these things and they just make a
loud concussion and scare all the birds
away
that is not true that's for real what do
you think bird poppers were all right
just that was cool inhale I'm gonna pop
some birds so we just got back to mat
set our gift happen to be shipped in and
it is here in this wooden crate listen
before we got here Matt texted me and
said hey whenever our guests come they
usually leave something behind like a
little gift or you know something that
represents you so Bree and I had this
shipped in it is one-of-a-kind gifts
that I was talking about was like and a
hat Alex made they left the Hat okay
well it's and Dutch a guy left a ceramic
chicken like little things this is a
huge wooden box it is and like I said
this is the only one in existence all
right so this is really special so I
hope you like it one of this yeah dude
how crazy is that
it's the only one in existence and it
plugs in you asked for a gift that we
can leave behind we just figured that
this is this is the gift your AmeriCorps
this thing in oh that is sick
smile all right well I think it
represents us pretty well you asked for
a gift nail it is did
well since it's Christmas morning Matt
just keeps giving us gifts look at this
I'm easily gonna do a whole vlog on this
guy's he got us not only that he's got
his name on it look how sick that is yet
hooks on to an ar-15 and turns it into
look at this okay
man you guys tight they start that way
there we go so you just take the chart
and the bolt and bolt carrier this is
ridiculous
and now so you don't you put yeah so you
put um blanks right regular blank ammo
you put a soda can down the barrel boom
and it launches a full soda can like a
hundred yards oh my god this balls yeah
top can p janus blows for Zeus it'll do
tennis balls like really far this is
like way too much dude this is way too
much meeting really so so you guys you
know I can't wait to come back I already
can't wait Rory's fresh can we come back
at Christmas and actually have a tree
full of yes look at all this stuff man
so I hope you like the sign I know it's
a little much but it is literally when
you said we want you to leave something
that like represents you this was the
biggest thing I could come up with what
I was meeting without leaving Brittany
here this was the next best thing
guys this is ah this is solid metal this
is aluminum and it's really nice it's
really crazy hanging you're gonna keep
it can you sign it yeah first can you
sign it sure yeah I bet I could make so
much money on eBay if they use black
powder with hot glue gun dude it's so
actual gern aids are prohibited
we can't go and buy an actual grenade
that shoots out of Matt actual grenade
launcher look at this thing good laboum
however they do so what's called a bird
banger kids these are bird banger
wildlife control kits and still super
cool but you have to really make them
it is super slim shadey up in here yeah
it looks like a ladder it's like a
science project you have all these parts
on really able to make like we didn't
know we need to have a ton below so
we're sitting here Matt is doing most of
the work you guys know this is way past
my educational skills chicken we're
watching YouTube videos just to figure
out how to do it good then I put the
other disc on you cap it I mean he
filled it all the way up okay whatever
you say
maybe we sit down by the bay make things
out of clay
what do you say yeah alright guys so we
have skip past quite a bit of time these
talked Oh while I'm making this is what
we're looking at right here that's it
they look so I don't know what to say so
what is this technically since these
aren't grenades we technically have a
signaling device right yeah that's what
it's called not a grenade launcher this
launcher will launch legit like military
grenades but you can't get those out
licenses so we have these you launch
flares and smoke and bird bangers out of
them which just make a big pop to scare
birds away yeah it's gonna be fun just
to see how these work and uh you know
test the test though and there were on
track there our first two we've ever
made so if they don't work that's our
little cabbie just say that I made them
if they don't work what's his fist - um
we'll see I don't know just for like
taking down buildings and such this is
gonna fire a charge will fire out of
this launching this thing out and then
we'll be a secondary charge that pops
apparent we actually don't know what's
gonna happen no clue here we go whoa
that's it that's it huh fire dude it we
had some mad distance I wasn't bad at
all I expected I expected why I really
did set it that's it you don't have to
pop save D just pull it whoo dang it
I must have packed that once a fireball
all right so it's definitely trial and
error with the grenade launcher uh I
think mine didn't pop and mine didn't go
as far as yours what I want went up
straight up it's all people were at
least they weren't total duds
well they strike could have been done
via the the shots impressive but I was
expecting more boom first grenades we've
ever made
yeah Matt's gonna make a sweet video for
you guys eventually with that thing for
now we've got some other things to play
with so let's go driving in the next
location
this is awesome man so much land so much
opportunity Nick cool all right dude I'm
ridiculously excited about this III
think my dog is gonna be excited about
this guys this mounts to the air I
already showed you this but you can put
tennis balls in it this is like the king
tennis ball launcher eight times already
on there oh yeah you're so sorry Owen
it's true it is and this is what it
looks like once you have it on oh my
gosh dude so for today we've got a 12
pack of soda pop you ready for this
Bailey's got him cold we got mr. t shirt
from yesterday here awesome to bounce
sodas on yeah let's hit him okay kind of
a crazy thing about these canned cannons
is you shoot blanks these are blank
bullets let me show you these
that's it doesn't actually shoot around

we're gonna load up I'm gonna just do a
test shot I'm gonna shoot one super
hands nice we're hot we are hot we got a
soda can you guys ready bring it I'm
ready I have no idea what to expect
oh my god think so take it off safety
you're ready to rock oh you know that
sounded terrible oh my gosh I think my
shoulders broken we're gonna let the
pros do it cuz Brittany and I can't pop
a can bears never shot and she's never
done it either okay put it like right
