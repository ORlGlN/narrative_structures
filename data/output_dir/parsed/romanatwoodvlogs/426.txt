are you uh-huh we are dude you don't
even have shoes or steering wheel what's
going on
hope you guys are having such a good day
man how you doing bud huh how you doing
what's your question I don't know you
know who will be there mm-hmm so right
now we're gonna head over to my parents
house and do some cool stuff with the
kids but Britney wants to take the
quality low dit up you want to take this
right 100% 200% my nights water back
here really Oh
let's load it up so we're pretty much
complete amateurs at this so we have a
ditch in our yard like a little stream
that runs through in the truck sit in it
so that the basically that basically the
bed is low to the ground so we can pull
the quad up without killing ourselves
we're not very good at it
where's flash I thought so will you get
him the dog literally sits under the car
tight we should have named him splat or
splash is he in the way I'm good I'm
going I'm going
see if we pull the truck into this
little stream it makes the bed roll oh I
see you I see you're gonna get squashed
dude you scare me so bad
so check this out I know if you watch
the vlogs you've already seen this but
look how low it makes our truck so even
an amateur can get it in like hook it to
the beds flat no just get it in like
ramp it in just get some speed and hop
you're all secure ready for shipment
keep it straight straight straight
straight right there now just stay
straight there you go
can you imagine this thing rolling out
like down the road like you're driving
and just falls right on the back it
doesn't matter the brake the straps that
we strap it in no matter what I fear
every time like that thing just rolls
out that's what I'm talking about like
who does that why why I tell you know
something has died in the woods
y'all maybe they're looking for you dude
you got a Harrow in your foot I know
you're gonna fall soon all right got my
boys in here you ready let's do it
so far so good on the mommy four-wheeler
transportation system everything looks
good how you holding back her Akane you
like this car now
yeah we are at the apple orchard Cain is
driving
as most of you guys know my dad has his
own apple orchard we like to come out
here and pick fresh apples if you've
never had an apple right off a tree whoo
baby especially if you have like some
hot caramel you dip it in oh my dad has
hundreds and hundreds of apple trees
look at all the apples and we plant we
planted these when I still lived at home
with my parents they were tiny little
trees and now they're all grown up into
these giant apple trees it's amazing
it's bringing back memories gain you
want a fresh apple yeah look at these
big green ones look at that
I'll take it take it rub it on your
shirt make it all polished I've ever
thought about how crazy fruit is that a
plant literally grows a full product
that's edible and delicious now oh
that's a good Apple did he's like I mine
now
see ya did if you have to go the
bathroom mom and dad have a bathroom how
long can you hold your breath it was
pretty good I can't hold it that long
really all right so my brother's here
which means he's got a crazy idea
it already looks like a mess what is
this I've waited so long to do the
certainement any win this summer it's
windy now there's a 24 foot military
surplus parachute strap it on your back
no my back yeah your back you're the
stuntman can you want to go fly
good news Roman you can take your cast
off we don't have to do surgery Dale
bring the parachute over oh my god
I lost you okay that's cool so
apparently now we gotta tie 12 ropes
which is every other one you would use
24 I think to make this parachute legit
every other one for the absolute most
fun so here's the idea guys it's pretty
much basic math we're going to wait for
the perfect wind to hit I'm gonna pull
and then hopefully land somewhere in
them trees don't take off well if you
hook it to the back of the quad it'll
take off so fast you serious Clark I
don't take much wind that is awesome
here we go it's windy watch out gainers
Dale's gonna get that's awesome we did
this once before way off camera way wind
caught this thing super high wind and it
hit the guy and it blew him back like
four feet almost knocked him out like I
was laying down for a while hey bro your
hands almost healed up grab this perish
you grab the parachute Roman
oh my gosh look back a pic squid he's
coming after me what I cannot stop yeah
hi Britt Saul you know that is crazy it
is so much harder than it looks but the
record it is windy but it's very mild
with any type of real wind you would not
be able to hold that what it's strength
training you got strength training go do
parachute exercise from dam go go go go
zip it couldn't get any dumber mom
brings a wheelchair this thing's been
around the world okay
you boys like Mexico there's no way
there's nowhere to put your feet the
things broke off with the kids this is
awesome oh dude I was awesome that was
good I think if we're on pavement we get
going about 30 mile an hour and I need
Drake's go out on the street but yeah
you gotta go you're gonna do it yeah but
you gotta stand back cuz it takes up so
much Lind space okay
wait for that window oh come on back oh
how that little wheelchair well the good
thing about doing it in a wheelchair is
if you get hurt you can just stay in the
wheelchair all right Dale just did
something that blew my mind I want him
to see I made him redo it for you guys
watch this okay this is if you want to
pack a lot of ropes without tangling
them I see just make a loop but you
don't close the loop uh-huh
and you just keep feeding the loop a
loop in this is to keep it from tangling
yeah it's not going to tangle on you and
you can bundle up a lot of cord tight so
it don't get tangled and loose and and
then you would put you would finish the
loop here like this uh-huh and then when
you pull on it oh my gosh that is
awesome
you're ready to go whooping home
whooping home hey don't you beat us so
fast hey flash what oh those are Lego
instructions
