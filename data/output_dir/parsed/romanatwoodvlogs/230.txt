hair down over here if you miss
yesterday's vlog we you gotta check it

access to our little swimming pool and
Donkey probably thinking the same thing
I am
are you thinking the same thing I am
take the rail off and then we have a
competition on a little challenge maybe
clash you want to get in on this we want
to get on seriously
seriously though this is what I'm
thinking we got this core here we got
this deck it's perfect runway you can
run you can jump on a boogie board and
you can make it all the way to the other
side you don't think I can it's not
something I've tried at this distance
but I have done this before look this
way on a different pool and this will be
the longest I've ever attempted never
been done might as well clean the
brand-new camera lens is already getting
crazy hope you guys are having an
awesome day like I said we're getting
late start but got a fun little
challenge and we got some updates for
you the pink envelope it's not so creepy
to say this but we have some updated
baby pictures today this is our baby

board bro carbon-fibre back yet what is
this it's not the one I thought we had
I'm sorry dude
dang it we gotta track down a good boy
you need that hard plastic balm to
really
across we can go to like the Coastal's
for right now I'll just run into
coastline bro when you see the water
turn right I got one more option I think
my actual boogie board was just probably
rotted out from laying outside his at my
brother's house I could call Dale see if
he's got something
Dale's grating Dale's always got
everything I know and I take it let's
take a lot of my stuff there and then it
gets left and can I just ask you
something what are you doing you you are
you watering the weeds I'm telling the
donkey flashback it's hot water
yeah buddy priming way to do this you're
gonna do it with me yeah yeah look at
that little look at that little boogie
turd we're gonna chase his idea of this
okay Gail for the rescue Dale to the
rescue the answers it's weird I'm
looking at myself twice two of me

pool that I'm going to remain in my dry
clothes all the way across climb safely
out of the pool still dry you're going
to be full because you're going to eat
those words love to show these boys what
their father can do here's the deal if I
don't make it it's because you didn't
hold the board in the perfect spot okay
and if you move that board when I jump
you're grounded for life did I say
ground or drown drown okay I heard your
desk yes now a little out litt that's
that's the spot right there calling
you're going to want to move buddy I'm
going to come in so fast you probably
have to run full speed along the side of
that pool to keep up so I can just job
