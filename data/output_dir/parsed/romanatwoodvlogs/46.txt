we've been playing here at the house in
the snow for the last few days it's been
so much fun but our rap finally came in
for the x3 this is something this is
something that you guys know I've been
excited about for a while and I'm
excited to show you the rap but she's
getting wrapped today she's super filthy
dirty I mean it doesn't even look at
this thing yeah watch fun every time
Ryan washes that I'm like dude I want to
go play and I get it all dirty I washed
it Friday what it was like so we are
going to take it over to Scott's right
now and
begin the process I'm just gonna bring
you along on what this is gonna be today
I think I'm gonna hang out show it how
it's done how they rap I don't know how
they do it um I don't know the progress
at all the process at all so we're just
gonna hang out have some fun today guys
thanks for joining us welcome to the new
year again and again let's have some fun
all right 57 miles on this thing it's
not bad we're about to have a lot more I
want to head up north maybe Michigan or
even Canada and play they got so much
snow can you imagine how deep I think I
just blew PPP it's like pulling up to
the paint spray right there pull up pull
up to the door it opens we're going yo
or go with tracks stop it yo this is
this is clean this is spotless before we
got here man that's khandhas thing is
jacked up my goodness this is for just
like mud-dogging that is wicked it's
literally a little tank amazing you guys
remember the one we had out at my pawn
it was it was this one actually might
have been the same same one
oh the track sell it guys I love sure
obviously I love tracks but that is so
cool imagine just mountain like a
paintball Gatling gun
like bad it's got the rock floor
so we're jumping around a little bit
because it's been about two hours since
my last clip they have a wash bay built
inside here so they're able to wash it
clean and get it very perfect
so these decals this wrap can go on here
and Brian forgot there were stickers on
there ask one sec dude it's crucial oh
look at all that glue that'll stick up
so basically it's night let me clean my
lens this thing is pill you guys so the
main TV camera clean is basically she's
all cleaned up and ready for decals
chase is gonna run some GoPro time
lapses so we have like some cool video
but being wrapped and worked on and yeah
what you gonna do what you're gonna do
and you ride blue you know I don't think
blue is your color you've always been a
red kind of bike you know better leave
this one alone leave her alone innocent
that's hanging out literally so the body
that says ride me take me to the candy
store
alright guys she's ready I got it all
tuned up and ready and wrap it partner
here oh dude
so what's the seat what's the secret to
getting a good good sticker clean you
know you guys got stickers peeling off
your bike's peeling off a car wood how
do you get a sticker off gasoline as far
as a glue it takes the glue off done lit
forgot they read it to the future I'm
gonna see where we could so good Roman
the wraps good in the future great great
it looks good so I'm here to explain it
should i guess i don't know what i
should show cuz i kind of just like one
of them situations where do i show you
the whole process the making of this or
do I wait until it's all done to reveal
it but I guess I probably I don't know I
should just show the works of it I think
at this point it's not much of a
surprise so I'm just gonna bring you
along on the ride basically every single
there's a lot of panels on this thing
they're everywhere each piece has its
own part
to make this rap complete and basically
basically each panel comes on these
giant sheets and this is how it's gonna
be wrapped I can show you a section that
he's already done over here check this
out
so here is this side in the works and
hahaha
super super excite it's just gonna look
so mean with the tracks the black and
the gray it's gonna be like a tank
sheets and sheets and sheep look at this
oh my that's a ton of work right there
this is gonna take out look at this
sheet right here
Wow that is so many stickers dude it's
just tons of sheets yeah yeah I wouldn't
even know like if I just picked the
random where's that go where's that
little one yeah where's that one yo

team effort today Scott started putting

in the back to says doubles now that is
a mean-looking
what are you doing chase we got the
paintball splatters inside and then yeah
so roughed out oh it's still roaming
right I don't know we need a name for
this thing it is so original it is
one-of-a-kind one-of-a-kind they do not
even make the tracks for this model they
had they had to rig it for the little
work so I don't think there's another
one out there this is it so it it
honestly came out even better than I
expected to I'm so excited about it it's
a shame that it's gonna get so dirty
