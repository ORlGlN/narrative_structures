drive flash like this and I'm a
four-wheel drive I'm gonna run out so

given a proper welcome we are a kind of
a weird day absolutely beautiful a
little windy but it's sunny you can't
beat that we actually haven't done any
RC stuff for a while so I'm excited oh
sorry I really need to spend a little
time cleaning my RC stuff guys I love
our C's I haven't done them for a while

we got applause for dinner and I got to
say you know we're on day seven when
chili is starting to taste like candy it
is literally taste so sweet and there's
this all-natural real food in it
Brittany just made some homemade Italian
direct that's warm water now it's time
coughing pretty much you guys know we're
on day seven now day seven with
absolutely zero added sugars believe it
or not even you can find dressings that
say no sugar but there's so much hidden
sugars and things there's so many names
for sugars so we're just trying to make
our own stuff so there actually is zero
sugar in a pot it means preparation that
means harder to do things everything
spoils fast I can think of 1 billion
reasons to eat sugar and I can think of
like almost zero it's torture waiting
for our battery to charge which only
have a few more minutes we're going to
eat and look what came easy dude
pizza rolls I'm not I'm not eating it
um I just want I just want more I just
want one
I couldn't let seven days of work to go
for one beats a roll okay she's all
charged up and ready yeah is the shame I
saw nice job you did a shot Iraq
oh my gosh
well I always gotta be four-wheel drive
we're gonna put it out
you mean Cain's gonna switch it out he
wants to do it lefty-loosey
righty-tighty halfway there ah here we
go oh just one that's so much fun it's
like a 50-plus miles our truck the Royal
blonde good job Kane finishing Evan
here's our Q how many time for this race
you're gonna fail after seven days this
is mommy so weak I'm not doing it I'm
not doing it not I'm not going to happen
for me I'm not going I can watch you
guys eat that you're really doing it
you're seriously eating ice cream
are we done really good what's today six
days
today is our seventh day we've completed
fix it you're eating ice cream and
Kane's telling me to do my push-ups
okay how many nice to do to gain 15 I do
14 yesterday yeah I see 15 push-ups I
will just do that right now before I
forget you guys know you're right now -
before you forget huh
I'm not eating ice cream not going to do
it on seven days strong almost seven
days after today today we're going to do
something a little different I might
teach you how to do a proper push up
okay here's the truth no matter how I've
ever done a push-up or anybody's ever
done a push-up in their entire life
somebody always says that's not how you
do a push-up matter what somebody has to
say so I'm going to show Kane how I do
push-ups which will probably be the
incorrect way to the internet but it's
the way that we do them so here we go
you just ride on my back and then I do
push-ups that's the problem
yeah let's see if I can do one with you
on my back how much how much you a leave
town
oh man it feels like a lot of weight
when I weight I substitute 50 pushups
keep your boat up in the air
okay no but but flat you there it is
nother straight up straight up yes you
can do it you can do it 15 push-ups if
you're going to join me we add one
push-up a day we started at 10 we're
already at 15 tomorrow will be 16 17 the
next day if you want to do them with me
let's do them right now we're gonna
knock out 15 push-ups real fast
oh good you enjoyed it
for bit me it's worth it I'm getting one
what can you put any way you want you to
future ice cream get back at work good

this is just climbing the wall
good I don't know I keep it on I guess
since I love you you just lost all that
pregnancy wait what happened
does this water all down in front of all
way to go Rex I want to be honest I
spent almost the entire day beside Akane
doing whatever Cain wanted I don't want
to say but Cain really really needed
some daddy time like real daddy time
like planned goofing off like a just our
imagination playing and having fun in it
man he needed it and I could sense it
and he kept you know so that's kind of
