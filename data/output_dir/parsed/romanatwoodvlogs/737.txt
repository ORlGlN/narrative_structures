hey guys so today's video is a little
different than usual first of all it's
in 360 so you should be able to look all
over our bathroom we've added a big
bright light to help with the quality we
know the quality is not perfect but
we're getting there
today Brittany and I are going to show
you the difference between a guy in the
shower and a girl on the shower this
should be pretty interesting so we have
to use cold water otherwise the hot
water will fog up the camera so it's
gonna be miserable first of all the
girls obviously have the cooler stuff
wash with like what do you watch with
you don't use the handle she uses her
fun fancy colorful things I usually take
whatever piece of Barna soap has left
and put it in a rag and close it and rub
is each other like this and it gets
super soapy well she uses some sweet
body wash and I use a generic so you've
got fancy soap and these colorful things
to wash your body I got to scrub my
armpit likes Carrabba
that's it once it get my rag all soaked
up man you gotta really scrub your pits
yeah stinky pits man oh you think you
think shaving takes longer than
scrubbing it's just like well through a
car wash said you know what we need my
flowers on the ceiling they're dry you
guys
water just what are you doing right now
with a scrubber yeah is it got batteries
okay guys how do we wash our face like
look at her turn the camera around
look at her let me in there how do we
wash her face this is how I start every
time every single time just like we'll
just put this on my own I got so so far
my eyes okay so we've already noticed
some obvious differences girls are a
little more delicate in the shower than
guys we gotta scrub dirty parts what
about hair I feel like that's the big
one
how do you wash your hair backwards like
you put your head back put it in a towel
every time you have that fancy fancy way
whoa yeah I could never figure that out
a million years okay guys back me up
here we don't normally wash our hair
like this do we I know I know
I go same with my face I gotta get this
every single time since I was born I
will say that I have watched my hair
like this like this
but once I put the soap in I try the
soap I washed every time I washed like
this so we're more than here we're to
learn them the differences between guys
and girls in the shower what else do we
do differently typically we don't wear
swimsuits
how many people have it and don't lie
how many people pee in the shower that's
a real thing I'm guilty of it I really
am it's so convenient like you get in in
the morning you got it you gotta go you
don't pee in the shower so obviously
there's a ton of differences between
girls and guys in the shower we're just
different beans it's supposed to be that
way tell me in the comments what you do
in the shower thanks for watching
you're awesome don't forget to smile
online I'm going to show you what
couples do in the shower
