what everybody does on a Sunday and that
is looking for my flame thrower a lot if
you watched yesterday's vlog it's not
what it's normal oh well you definitely
if you watch yesterday I am lost I
didn't misplace it I lost my
flamethrower it cannot be found I've
looked everywhere today
everywhere guys I've searched the whole
house from plastic play balls I mean the
whole basement I've checked everywhere
oh look at this haven't really been down
here too much but we're redoing the
whole basement actually this is about to
be all finished and redone and turn into
a mystery this probably the more crazier
parts you guys if you watch this for a
while then you know we used to have a
back door here in the basement well now
it is no more we've filled it in we are
finishing this place out crazy right
look at this somebody sent this one like
truck hitch look at that I'm if I showed
you guys that boom don't just lose a
flamethrower I keep saying if somebody
has taken somebody has taken my
flamethrower it is gone it's not in the
laundry did you change that fast you got
that baby heat telling you it's not here
I mean I really guys I've really dug for
this I'm about to just say that it's not
here and we have to move on cuz it's so
nice uh no I was thinking like tonight
bonfire you guys coming in come on help
me I need help i need that nose
give me that nose I just can't imagine
like carrying a flamethrower into the
store like I don't think it's in here
you guys want to see something really
funny watch this just a normal day at
smile more boom there's a donkey in our
building you found it No
I definitely didn't no way seriously two
days worth of water found cane that
looks so good dude I'm everyone those
forever
let's go guys works over all right guys
check it out I know I've showed you this
before but I've never got to use this it
is a handheld legit blank I mean it
shoots fire very far and I'm pumped
about it I've never got to use this so
today after two days of searching and
his ass Brit Brit I don't know what I'd
do it out this girl I'm serious guys
it's like she's my safe apparently you
got a charge to stay in everything first
thing we got to do guys is charge it I
know it sounds so weird if the charge
something like this but it has an
internal battery there's an on button
and it basically powers the spray see
this baby you get a good look I'm
reading instructions that's died now
well right off the bat I need things I
don't have so we're gonna have to make a
run a quick run we need it we need this
right there
flash no dude he's so bad he purposely
does it move doggie move donkey oh my
gosh they don't care I wouldn't even
have that kind of trust in front of you
like if I seen you I would not stand
there's no way I'm a little shy on a
couple things we're gonna run the store
real quick and a little time together
this is Ricky's mom came over and she's
got the kids so we're gonna run out get
what I need to do what I want to do and
then
that's that's that's really about enjoy
this weather unbelievable it's so pretty
no heck no ain't gonna have goats anyway
you won't get some ferns baby you won't
get some ferns no like we don't hold
hands for a long time it feels it's like
we're dating or something like the
boyfriend/girlfriend they are would you
tell everybody no actually I can't
believe it feel like I've been coming to
this I own the store way too much for a
normal person okay I think oh gosh and
none of these matched photos like I
don't
yes it's like camping and ah I don't
know I have to ask somebody I don't know
what to get and that's definitely not
what this is and does anybody actually
work at stores anymore like have you
noticed that you go into like a store
you don't really see employees okay no
luck there we asked a couple people we
did find people working and they do not
have them so we're going to our next
person we asked you know I hate to say
this but I'm just guessing that retail
retail will still be around when our
kids kids are shopping do you think
everything is going online because I
know for me I order a lot of Simon
almost order everything unless I need it
right now I run out but I don't know if
retail is gonna be around forever I feel
like everything's going to the Internet
so convenient right she's so deep
concentration I feel like you're having
the baby right now I think that I'm
Sylvia
really people like to get out you won't
need to get out
this is serious conversation I want your
guys's opinion because when I was a kid
you didn't order anything online
there was no online ordering so now it's
become so convenient so easy to just
jump online you got companies that send
you things literally same-day delivery
next day delivery it's becoming so easy
whoo mania I truly believe there's a
chance that retail will die very shortly
maybe not all the way what what's that
oh it's good attractor I know why you
brought me here they have chicken maybe
I gotta have me a pair I gotta have me
pay you guys see me out there digging
now yeah they're baggy they're a little
bit they're not skinny jean version we
gotta focus camping no oh no so you've
been here yo these are amazing look at
these little guys these are like
traditional look at how cute they are
I know they have velociraptors hey look
at these what I'm gonna tell you
straight up where we live coyotes
breakfast lunch and dinner right there
you get you could get three of them
here's their names breakfast lunch and
dinner I could see you coming in right
now you breakfast is dawn okay so
apparently the cans we're looking for
our seasonal seasonal which means most
stores have already shipped them into
their warehouse or at least we got a
yellow bucket so we're either gonna keep
searching store to store it or we're
gonna order it online
going down Mayday Mayday okay now what
two down I saw like the two main like I
thought would have it yeah I don't know
about you but they're chickens made me
hungry I'm kidding all right here Pizza
Pizza Pizza
Britney favorite I don't know I pick I
pick not for me though for you this is
champion gentlemen so I have been coming
here since I was a little kid my parents
brought me here pits coach seems like my
parents always talk about business
there's a haunt me and day I remember me
and my brother saying can we talk about
anything else and then I find me and
Brittany always doing the same thing
like you start talking about our work
and our things we got to do and our like
it's so funny how time just like boom
you're an adult you worked here and your
mom were too when I was a kid coming
here your mom is probably one of our
servers that's so crazy
I wonder if like if I was this little
kid knock and I imagine walking up to be
some foreground Daulton being like I'm
gonna date your daughter one day what
we're walking back home and I kind of
but I feel like we should've went you
know where she is it's seasonal that's
what everyone kept saying we only carry
these things seasonal camping supplies
but I was gonna I went to Walmart I
feel like I feel like I'm at I messed up
I said a Walmart four times but you did

well that was a fail that was a fail
dang it
very funny guys very funny what if I
stepped on that all sword what happened
what happened to our day just
disappeared
what more how easy it's time for our
daily our daily poop poop team one buddy
he's like wait I only get one what else
you got
what is that flash what is that it's a
snake
is that a snake or is it a garden hose
what is it what is it
all right guys so this is probably the
part and the reason you clicked on this
vlog I would guess is that's because you
want to hear what we're about to say and
why we're gonna do it right yep yep
we've decided as a whole as a family as
a unit has one that we've been doing
this a long time actually quite a while
a couple years three years maybe
vlogging and we just have hit a point
where I think that we all need a break
like you need a break can you need a
break
he told us he needs a break earlier um I
guess what I'm trying to say is that
we're gonna take a break from YouTube
for a while we're gonna take a break and
rather than just like not uploading we
figured we'd at least explain it right
now in this vlog and just basically tell
you that we will be back we're gonna be
back probably how long do you think you
want six days how long do you want you
don't want to break you won't agree
you're good okay well I'm just gonna say
that you need a break alright no one
needs a break we all need a break so I
guess we'll be back in I guess from the
time this vlog goes up 24 hours we'll be
back so pretty much everything I just
said is a complete lie we're not taking
a break we're not leaving stuck with us
we're not taking a break that's that's
the truth we're not taking a break in
fact we're better than ever everybody's
excited everyone's rockin Noah is
starting a YouTube channel tomorrow
that's a lie too ain't starting a gaming
channel 12 that's a lie too we do on any
channel you want to start I was thinking
this summer all nation

computer I know right we as a whole as a
unit as a family as one are not taking
time break up I can't help it I just
can't help messing with you guys more I
love you guys we had to do it I thought
it'd be fun as a family but these guys
didn't help me that much you're like I
really need a break no buying into are
we cake are we it was Ben I could have
done it better with practice but we did
it we just did it the way we did it I
feel like you're happy that we're not
taking a break now but I feel like
you're also mad at me for how bad that
joke
in my head I was like it's gonna be
hilarious they're gonna be like relieved
