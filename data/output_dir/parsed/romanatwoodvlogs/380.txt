a reindeer in limousine style actually
heading back to my house which is where
most of all of my bad ideas take place

us no no that bull don't or whatever
yeah like a skid steer oh yeah you know
I I
I mean you guys might hate me for this

that thing I want to flip the limo
what I wanted this was a Christmas gift
I've always wanted to flip a car and you
just gave us a limo Grove like what are
we actually gonna do with it we live in
California Roman yeah I didn't think it
through
yo let me Cali huh so I'm just say we
put it under it and just flip it over
what if you try to manually flip it
first like driving in my yard rope like
dragon I can do that I get some speed
and then yank it if you need to build a
jump first
I can build jumps you think you could
flip this this car Oh 100 feet here's
how you do it you build a mound that you
slide into no no here's how we're built
we've although ramp for one tire and
then you turn yeah hold up but I feel
like that's that's a little unsafe yeah
dude I get helmets yeah helmet you swipe
your fire super sure just come up wisdom
to virus we shouldn't take it easy I've
got a good film it
I literally have rows of fire
extinguisher bro we're chilling fine but
but what you have to do is when when
you're about to tip over
duck down in case the roof compresses on
your neck oh that happens you see a roof

what is your mission I mean I'm trying
to flip the limo how are we gonna do
this you definitely need that kind of
speed I watched her vlog yesterday and
don't you have like a Bob Kevin I think
we take a four-wheeler on the limo on
top yeah it's so better it's such a big
quad
this next piece is called the limo table
top limo table
we're gonna build a tabletop jump using
the limo as the roof keep coming forward
I just want to block the front doors
keep coming
that's it yes way now I need 20 minutes
behind me you see a youtuber dumping
dark next to a limo so using his like
death machine thing Roman is dumping
dirt there's a little bit he's building
the ramps right now
the lip is sick oh yes okay so we're
just shaping the down side now but look
at this dot look at this lip alright
that's looking good

limo yeah already take it to the next
level I'm so ready bro I've been ready

sit in the limo and have you flip it
with the caterpillar oh really
just falling off what you think all this
no crazy yo our double went really well
it looks so good that now I have to I
don't want to remove it I think this
should be a permanent piece in our
backyard look at that it's another hard
part how do you remove the limo from
thousands of pounds of dirt on each side
of it literally so heavy that all the
back windows are gone it just caved in
the best I can
otherwise I'm gonna go behind it pick
the back end up and drive it forward I
mean are you gonna try to drive it out I
might as well it's gonna do nothing try
it try it
oh it's front wheel yeah the front wheel
spinning yeah I thought it was rear
wheel backup reverse I know I just want
Midway's so much

throws car Omo and the cars destroyed
