come on go back please
I got money right here welcome to the
vlog guys it's too early I'm not a
morning person I think you guys know
that I think editing has created that I
woke up at 5:00 actually you should have
sick but listen my probably it's only
558 we're going to talk okay
because at 5:45 I had to get up to pee
and I'm like should I light it like
every single time I have alarms that I
wake up Cristina
 you I wake up 45 minutes after I
don't even really know how to explain
what we're doing today I really don't we
we've got so much to do we've got a
multiple flight to think the best thing
to do is just start traveling take you
along and I guess we'll just take it one
step at a time
here we go
so we're too late I'll be able to make
do yeah okay so as I know there's no way
to get on that so now is there anything
we missed our flight guys we didn't
actually miss our flight or fight is is
here and it's sitting but we can't get
back there because we miss check-in by
this fudge I'm frustrated we've never no
matter how late we've been we've never
missed a plane yeah but maybe that's why
we miss this flight it's crazy now it's
not even up to people it's up to
computers computer shut off but they're
trying to get us on the plane but they
can't the computer won't allow us to
check in it's crazy
okay I'm not kidding they just gave us
tickets to get on the plane but they
didn't guarantee it
really are these yeah oh man we all
right dude what what the heck happened
oh oh
holy freaking cow I don't know what just
happened what we're getting this dude I
don't even know what just happened I
can't even put on camera what just
happened it's the most insane ridiculous
thing this plane is just sitting and
waiting like me walking in please bill
he gave some ass in my car how did I
miss that call it flying through this
whole sign like his bag personating back
enough and he fell asleep it will fly
never lose
so we made it to Chicago and I'm not
exactly sure how we made it was probably
one of the craziest journeys laughing
yeah yeah you said you're the best
I feel like this is the point where like
a good blogger versus me it's like a
good blogger captures of story of his
day and today I miss so much
we're in Chicago we missed our flight we
got on our flight Karl held up the plane
I have to do to the once the Walmart
meeting you do whatever it is they knew
that the plane was held up wouldn't give
me it wouldn't give a ticket nothing and
not cool so we made happen Karl my to
heaven um it is honestly thought my just
commit capture for you guys but it's
been a mess getting to Chicago and the
journeys not over it's not over we
supposed to get to Arkansas I cannot
believe that all I'm trying to explain
to the viewers that I couldn't capture
it okay so I'm you know I'm security
you're so I get here stuff I'm running
over to get our to get propane Karl's
walking mighty arms like oh hey Karl
and he literally just takes the whole
thing like this last piece and they're
signing everything counting down and
he's got like the red ball I hope we got
on the flight hello
and but then she said no right yeah she
told me no you should like you're dying
on this so then I had this little cut
and I'm like squeezing it like oh my god
this is like really bleeding now I you
have a band-aid so the lady had to go
and the lady helped us all right we're
heading to Arkansas I I don't think I've
ever been the artist all my life ever
I'm you you never been even Arkansas yes
miss bill we're going to bismillah
bismillah organ foam here we come I have
to do is go into an old high school and
it's still Arkansas we don't
birthdays I went to success because I we
don't have to go back this is kind of
make it your client Oh
we made it to Arkansas and I thought the
airport was small and twice for the kids
play area you're going so fast
make me vote with you little eggs we're
in Arkansas we have a 1:30 p.m. meeting
at Walmart we're meeting at the head
with it at the head with the head crazy
thing we have a four o'clock flight to
LAX Los Angeles and then we have on the
flight out of their philosophy okay
so Brittany's going crazy back there
where we are we're using our minds -
guys we have a rental car we are in
Arkansas which looks just like home I've
never been to art I hope I'm saying that
is it
Arkansas or Arkansas Arkansas it's not
impressive I feel like I've never heard
that we're going to Walley world
bell rings uh-oh cinnamon are
consecutive neck so we are here to meet
with the head buyer of warmer and how
long did this meeting take - good it's
been a year in the making dude so we're
it took a year to get a meeting with
Walmart and keep in mind crows know the
bar warmer this is the programs and
they're the up buddy and it still take
deer to get into warmer so we're going
there to pitch some things probably not
what you're thinking uh we live in Ohio
so you see a lot of cows I've never seen
this recount this is calculus
good for them cows are so many cows the
first Walmart ever created is actually
here in Bentonville and it's a little
shop and they've dedicated it now it's
like a real retro sweet it's like a
little store yeah it's not a big
building no I was just like the start
yeah these are all start find out what
this is actually a part of my life that
we would probably typically not put in a
blog this would be a part of the
business that we wouldn't show but I
just feel like this is also part of the
journey I want to remember and also want
to bring you guys along we have a
meeting with the head of warm on like
this could be Walmart it is the biggest
retailer in the world maybe it might be
a little boring for you guys right now
but it's just something that I do want
to include that's like Ohio whoa what
are these dang that's a nice community
right there whoo I guess what I'm trying
to say is I am bringing you guys along
on this tray we'll see what happens I
have no idea at all just so you know our
meetings at 1:30 the meeting took a year
to get and you pull over we do all day
so we're doing right now I'm going to
connect see I thought you might draw I'm
like mom and somehow we switched
positions I was just driving like one
minute I looked up and then boom I'm in
the passenger seat dude your hunger took
over Linda how did that happen
right run delay out it's getting really
really tight time was this is quite the
journey guys honestly we've already had
two flights of crazy morning and we're
actually ten minutes away from the
meeting look at that how do we do that I
don't know we had six minutes a second
ago
we gotta throw up in the back it's been
a wild day guys I wish that I was a good
enough story teller location right yeah
then we just got late because I'm trying
to actually talk to my viewers and you
guys are yelling at me and take a right
uh-huh
and your very first left you'll cut in
there into that block okay just to the
west of you okay appreciate this thank
you so Jude we're at the actual layout
Center now so this is a store entirely
built up and it's a fake Walmart
basically it's their store although I
know we're late we're late we're late
trying to bring you guys along crazy
it's a fake store but every other
shelves are full and it looks like a
silver bumming out before anybody else
does yeah
to basically talk about shelf space and
where it would go and what it would look
like and that's how they do it
the future is in that box so here we go
I thought that I can film anything
inside but uh wish us luck
the crazy idea and we're going they
don't they don't buy this stuff with
your sell these things right out here
we made it 1:29
and 49 seconds I would love all the
craziness today seconds late oh pretty
good
I don't know what is every dad yeah
maybe maybe get that excited yeah it's
there anytime it's basically well brick
I mean it was it's just new and it's
this innovative imagine dedicating half
of a year of your life and then
everything goes down to one day and that
is just not happy not one day like 15
minutes yeah Wow
and that's actually your first buyer
meeting for some it is like oh my gosh
okay our turn were you walking you catch
up you pitch your product
yeah and Mark Cuban just bought it okay
we're going to Northwest Arkansas
Regional Airport back to the airport oh
my god 20 minutes back to the air for 20
minutes and I kill me so just get up do
what you want to do guys this day really
proves to me that you gotta just you
gotta make that jump man you got a leap
forward you got to take risks like this
was a crazy day for us at the end you
got to take the first step you don't
have to see the whole staircase take the
first step there you go
gotta crawl before you walk in things
what you're saying yeah take this blog
and like I swear I told these guys that
we could have made a movie today was so
crazy to get this meeting at Walmart
with so I just seen a possible this one
anything we're gonna make it we freakin
made it happen didn't know we all did
like I know so many cows I think the
last time I had four plane rides in one
day was when I flew to China China not
the last time I polluters first time I
flew to China Thailand
it was Thailand we took like four or
five flights again remember okay
I can't even make this luck our flight
right there you see the motor open or
whatever the dude our plane is broke
it can't be good just can't be you can't
make this up a flights delayed
like seriously delayed I know we need to
go talk currencies we need a girl this
is our surface we still have another
flight after this and if we don't get on
this one in time we miss our fourth boy
yeah because merely haven't 90 minutes
out we have 40 minutes seems like if
we're delayed by an hour already
we're already to 30 minutes and we're
not I can't even make this up man my
camera blurry come on baby
our flight just got canceled till 7:00
a.m. tomorrow morning that knotted yes

next
like what's the next thing that I'm
going to tell you so resistant resistant
real okay change of plans
we just got flights to Dallas Texas from
Dallas way but apply from baked to Vegas
I'm losing my mind today really where
we're going or how we're getting there
we're just following a button oh we're
moving forward all you can always do
don't say that our bags are going to
show up they do that they're on the
other flight we're screwed the other
plane broke down I know but what if it's
still sitting on there it's not they're
going to be there pushing forward we are
pushing forward we shove another play
after this plane and our new seats we
don't get to sit together I'll see you
later
those two ladies we just what's the
exhibit Brittany and I could sit
together I know

that
and height I would only I would only
wear spider-man's suit I wash with this
I think sure everybody said by the way
I've been shooting 60 frames all day
tell me you guys enjoy this it's a
totally different look in my opinion
always shoot 30 frames but I'm squeezing
the air but I was going to say is we're
looking to skip to our last play our
last our last trip to Las Vegas
hopefully we just get on this plane and
we go there's been a thank you
what the heck I think by the time we get
to our hotel I was gonna be cuckoo bird
cuckoo for cocoa puffs

the plane and you're in almost afraid
like in the middle being three three
hour flight 3 hour flight
where else would you see slot machines
at the airport soon as you land as soon
as you get off the plane you just be
slot machines I think my mom won $500
