camera I love you I love you I think
Emma's coming to they're going to
laundry with you alright so this is how
we're looking right here guys beautiful
little runway we've been working on
trying to get it flats a little soft
we've had so much rain last two days
been beautiful and sunny so it's been
drying this out we were hoping to do it
you guys know we were tried to do this
four days ago and just kept raining so
hopefully today's our day just keep
reworking it packing it making it as
hard as possible and building this
runway as flat as possible you guys have
no idea how bad I want to do this
oh I want to look at that sayonara true
we got it we gotta like do some serious
measurements I want like when he hits we
got to measure how far he action went
because I told him just like you know
just find a Lightspeed and hit it you
don't have to go and he's like no I'm
going full speed
I don't know country G happy oh oh
come on baby Oh Oh
verochka neither directly got this
horrible ride
the bikes running the ramp is looking
good
like it looks great I got up I want to
hit it at least once a day how you
feeling right now talk talk to me talk
to the viewers how you feeling well I
had my last supper earlier you rather
hit the jump then shave your beard
absent is that the only reason you're
doing the jumps to keep the beard 100%
but I would have done the job I wanted
done to jump no one saved the beer all
right lesson number one the God's honest
truth country is never driven a street
bike nope neither of us ever I drive
bikes but never a street bike and you're
gonna be driving out on the street so I
think it's only right that we learn how
to drive it in a dirt step number one
for those of us have never driven a
street bike if you're out in the dirt
which is a fun break we'll walk the
front tire up and slide out this is the
back brake that's the clutch all right
first attempt my man you got this nice
and slow
well don't whiskey throttle it there it
is Oh
well I mean this is hard like for
someone who never ever liked like it
it's more complicated what people think
it is I don't know if I'm just making it
cop there it is
there you go more gas
yes yes yes he's going it that's it he's
running the bike baby he getting it
small right he's so happy
more gas I actually did it mama did it
for the first time you proud of him yeah
you can probably up it you price safety
it on the back seat now like 40 tries
but no country the buzzards are looking
for you man
come on my dad my mom down just showed
you guys ready for the show Brittany's
gonna sing the national anthem for us
and we're gonna be on our way
fireworks gonna be ready get our seats
get your seats because right now I'm
making this happen you feel confident on
the bike you know what I'm telling you
this right now not only I feel confident
you know I wanted you now I'm super
pumped about this and at the end of the
day I'm doing this for me oh you ready
to fly you point you add in five extra
horsepower with that sticker some
practice runs oh my gosh
country's pomp been a little nervous
honestly about the whole thing because
country is uncomfortable on the bike but
he's getting comfortable I'm gonna go
out right now move the fountain the odds
of him making it that far are so crazy
but just in case I'm gonna move the
fountain um I'm pretty sure I'm pretty
sure from the fountains of the ramp is
like a hundred feet I don't think he's
going that far better safe than sorry
though right you just just play it safe
I mean everything we do save this water
has gotten amazing look at that it's so
nice now pretty much just gets high rope
this fountain pull it over to the
shoreline so you I honestly think you
need more practice on the bike but you
just want to go like now I want to do it
and if I store you know just work with
me but the minute I get that bike going
you're gone I'm telling you I'm just
ready to touch this touch the clouds I
saw him I saw him over there practicing
and he's going like and he's making
these calls like playing on flying but
if you're right if you're saying you're
ready you're the only one that actually
has to be ready here
I'm ready Roman what we're ready to film
it watch it laughs too hard this next
done they'll pull his neck out last
night so we're getting set up we got
smoke bombs on the bike and let me see

up BAM how's that feel I guess
you look amazing safety first you got
your parachute okay are you free diving

at the end of the runway great runway
Brian that's correct
air traffic control clears you for
takeoff country you are clear for
takeoff airspace is open air space is
open hands they're shaking look at his
hands
we got the the old bottle trick this is
gonna be what makes us find the bike in
the pants that we can pull it out with
the cat and then we've got a couple
lawyer little smoke bombs here for show
