minutes of filming you know what it's
not the cops fault it's the pussy-ass
people they call the cops this car
pulled in at the graveyard and just sat
there with the lights could have came up
asked us what we're doing but they're
scared because they watch the news all
day and
movies and they just assume that were
criminals and I got tattoos so you know

people people would change souls can
pick turn all these people how many cops
