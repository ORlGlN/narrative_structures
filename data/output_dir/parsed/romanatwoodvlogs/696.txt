your legs what are you trying to write
okay hey you want often we go what are
you doing trying to get us kicked out of
here whoa I'm just kidding did that have
a job no I was great it was funny I
liked it so we're now headed to our
first zip location what's the longest
zip line here actually on our
all property what we're going to be
doing about a thousand feet thousand
feet that seems
now you've never had a thousand-foot
but that's so funny
so we're headed to do this today that is
that the last one you do no no after the
1000 up to more supplies awesome
I'm very excited it's so ND up here are
you ready
see baby i love you she's gone
i just warped down to the 200 i couldn't
vlog it we brought a gopro here comes
Alfie what'd you think it was awesome
you look adorable because traffic landed
yeah she did
come next
this is brick coming next hit though it
should be yeah this is I highly advise
you guys to do something like this there
probably something in your area no
matter where you live there's some crazy
zip line tours this is something really
fun to do it's it's great little family
friends whatever if it comes rip
nice talking to me how was that when I
was fast that was that he liked getting
a really big this is good this is good
it's so much pasta this one assault even
if you're strapped in it's still scary
it's like not even far oh you should
jump down he Blake he'd break his bloody
biscuits okay we are now hiking up up up
up
what is it all the river the river the
river this is really cool it's nice as
the wind stopped down in this this
ravine it's pretty down here though but
like one month ago all these Leafs would
have looked amazing like bright now it's
all dead
this is by far my favorite zip yet for
scenic reasons we just came right into
this what's it called not a cave a
recessed cavern a recessed cavern
because I guess a cave is only a cave if
there's zero natural light coming into
it so yeah I don't know where we're
going now lunch right
is this our lunches and you can probably
scavenge something already thirsty at
all we got some water here for you but
if you're good to go I'm on up onto the
bike store down there you drink out of
the falls
yeah so this one is unbelievable you
can't even see the you just go through
the trees and this is the fastest one no
it's one of the fast one of the fastest
I like speed like one as fast as
possible
she gonna make it yes perfect
oh great

foot so that's a wrap on the zipline

do you want to control me check I'll
just flog it up so you kind of have to
wait to kick in before we can start
drawing here's a quick look back my box
you can tell that this is before it
really kicks in and then that's
ridiculous he said to they got like
eight you start off you go my all it's
pulsing he's got squirt

it's over look you guys rip it off you
oh no we have a 50 oh my gosh
we all completed a box that's a tough
call so this is our boxes who won the
box this is the level we made it to and
some of them we think I don't know if
this is accurate this one we have to go
to level 30 and take a drink of water
basically that's gonna be ridiculous oh
you got the red cups do the big red cups
it'll be just as funny and just put like
a little water well I'll let you know
even if you got the cost I don't know if
you can your fingers are like gone this
still feels weird yeah okay I'm gonna
start again okay so there's a little bit
of water in each cup the challenge is go
to level 30 and drink the water I don't
know I'm not even gonna have to pick
this up I'm gonna have to let you get
out there so I'm not at all yeah well I
don't know what it's gonna be like what
do you mean not very happy
