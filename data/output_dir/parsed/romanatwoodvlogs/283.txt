during these vlogs are able to just set
aside anything you're going through
right now you know I used to tell you
guys all the time that we're all
struggling we're all going through
things and we are every single one of us
is struggling right now with something
you're not alone rolling this together
man I wish that there was a way for us
all to team up not a lot of problems
together you're not alone no matter what
it is you're going through somebody if
dealing with stuff even worse than you I
don't feel like I've done like a preach
to you guys in a while but I just need
you to understand how frigging important
you are how strong you are how you're
going to get through
anything like it's so crazy how powerful
you are and I need you to understand it
I need to get back to always telling you
I used to tell you every day so
important somebody call me Crisco let's
see who's calling me right now my
manager
that'll be instead let's let's try to
get back on those challenges number one
I used to challenge you guys won let's
start with one hour today one hour only
positive thoughts if something negative
happens you've got to figure out why
it's positive what I'm telling you guys
the worst thing that happen to you in
life have a positive side swimming you
just got to realize the worst things
that have happened to me in my life have
ended up being blessing and turned me
into a better version of Who I am right
now so usual problems figure out the
positive side of when you figure out why
you're going through them don't worry
about them worrying changes nothing take
action understand that it's going to be
for the better I know it sounds crazy it
really does and it is but it's for the
better there it's always a lesson
use the lesson take smiling gosh keep
your head up face smile and it so it
sounds it sounds cheesy sometimes we're
so true man be positive like do it just
bear I'm still on a mission and I think
I just landed it guys here it is watch
yesterday's vlog I tried to find fuel
for my flamethrower
I think that's what it is and I just
couldn't find them anyway but it looks
like this is it oh that is totally it
look at that that's it we found it dude
I guys would go back home I got to buy
something that I've never bought in my
entire life like literally never even
heard of this before until today fly
spray somebody's calling me let's
see who it is Brittany
hello they've never heard of this in my
life but there are so many auctions
literally fly spray everywhere I know
what to get how do you know what to get
dude I don't know I'm just going to get
a couple of making sides maybes dude can
even see out of that it's a fly mask I
just bought
but I just got three things I've never
bought in my life
bags of finest Alda for rubber mats and
two bottles of flak spray for horses
cattle donkeys farm animals barns you
name it
my whole life my whole life going in the
stores go out all these things three
things I've never bought in my life
simple things you know I guess I just
never done a last thing that I want to
bring up I don't want to bore you guys
but I do want to challenge you I do want
to do there's reasons that I make these
videos one not only am i capturing my
memory is amazing to look back with my
family years ago and watch these videos
create a career create a better life for
my family and I and to push you guys the
challenge you guys use these videos for
a sense of motivation I hope that when
you watch these videos there is a sense
of wanting to challenge yourselves and
wanting to do something that maybe you
wouldn't do I do not watch this video
pushing you to do what it is that you
want to do there's more to life than
going to school every day graduating
going to college getting that job paying
your bills there's more to life and that
is passion and doing what you love
inside of what we normally do in life
finding what it is you love
to do and chasing it down and making it
yours I'm telling you there is so much
more to life than just paying your bills
you've got to challenge yourself not
only into me this is where the challenge
comes in because it's easy it is easier
to choose the other route Andy to choose
like positive and negative being
positive is hard it is a challenge every
day we all face so many freaking
problems horrible problems and it's just
easier to choose the negative five
solids
let's life sucks and I can't do it I'm
not even going to try it's just easier
it's lazier to be negative it is truly
just an easier route in my opinion to go
positive the lid pauses to slap a smile
on your face even though you're going
through some of your worst time is a
challenge it is difficult and it is
never going to be easy but I promise you
if you can find that route maybe meet
the middle you know you're going to come
across times where you just either some
days where I'm fighting myself
stop being friggin negative I'm thinking
negative it's just we're humans like
we're going to do it that's where people
where humans like we're all struggling
with that fight learn what it is that
you love will help your life so much
attacking and finding and chasing that
passion will help you get to that
positive that positive lifestyle it's
it's more than a mindset it's finding
what it is that you love to do doing
what you hate you'll always be working
and you'll always be fighting to be
positive because you're doing what you
hate to do don't get it man go get it's
not you're not going to wake up tomorrow
and everything you've dreamed of is
going to be said now you got it you've
got a challenge yourself I know I'm
venting I'm going on way too long here
but I hope you take one one thing from
this blog today beyond the fun and the
flamethrower that I'm about to light up
I hope you take away I said you may be
you're young maybe you're eight if
you're
sixteen maybe or thirty maybe you're a
parent every day is a good day to start
just start we're in this together man
let's team up start whatever it is
you've been putting off I know you've
been putting it off I know you do it
