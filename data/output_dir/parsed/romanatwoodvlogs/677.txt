everybody's gonna think it's your
birthday hey speaking of birthdays
yesterday you guys know I was super sick
Zeus's birthday was yesterday I feel
really bad you got you want to go get
him a gift something yep he deserves
something yeah I think that means yes
you want to get Zeus a birthday present
I think we should and then we should go
to like a party starting at some type of
a dog wrapping papers your homework all
you think he can unwrapping a present do
you think you can woo okay so where we
going where exactly are we had we need
Zeus where you get Zeus up for his
birthday but I don't know what to get or
where to go I've never ever even
celebrated a dog's birthday but this is
like he's my cane see there's a party
store around here let's go get Zeus a
gift
come on the sad truth is the only thing
Zeus cares about is this tennis balls
that's all he loves I'm pretty sure just
kidding halos on accident those are too
small just put something bigger how
about a hiking stick not a dinosaur bone
how about a foot come up I know she is
okay Zeus a puppy
we grab a bird check out a bird his eyes
are so red like mommy when she's mad
where's their donkeys them of donkeys if
they had a donkey we'd all be in trouble
like maybe you could be friends with
Zeus yeah maybe I have a feeling though
our problem is we don't have a normal
dog like there's no toy ever constructed
the Zeus can't just devour and that's
exactly what he does uh-oh Caine's got a
bad case of the squeaks death or you put
his tennis ball in there and so Matt I'm
voting for that if it's an actual size
tennis ball duh it's like a he'll
destroy any of those balls we found a
little something-something for him we're
gonna run in here and see if we can find
some party supplies we're really doing
this
yeah this is Britt's idea I love the dog
but I don't know about party spot
Valentine's yeah well doesn't seem as
crazy now since there have a whole
section dedicated to dogs no this is not
to dog this is just to a puppy themed
birthday what this this you put that on
his cake oh I wish I would have made him
a cake
I think this would look pretty fly and a
watch big enough for watches that's good
you just lucky puppy that's gotta be the
dark hair dark hair pulling me by my
legs all the way there but you're not oh
he completely decided do it again get a
good grip our new puppy persona no pup
here you carry the whole thing a baby oh
happy birthday Zeus he's not allowed to
look yeah he's not allowed to look
mommy's wrapping gifts yeah drop it good
boy ah
Zeus it's your birthday is it huh I've
seen this before
yeah you might have to help him gain but
all I cares about is this tennis ball
we did when we forget oh now we can open
presents what are we going what are we
doing right now
this doesn't like his hat this you could
entertain cane all day like that
c'mere Zeus oh man he really wants his
ball
we hit a homerun with your birthday
didn't we he don't even want the treats
we got out only once tennis balls
they should make tennis ball flavored
treats Brittany got him a board game
kitten Zeus has his fun board game what
do you have to do he's got to remove the
yes oh he's just gonna eat the whole
thing and he doesn't like these treats
so that's not Laura what's in there
she was steak in there yeah oh he smells
it he wants it oh oh oh he's smart he's
smart
I'll tell you how I got Zeus to begin
with I was wanting a German Shepherd for
a long time and at the time there was no
way that I could afford a dog like that
like they were so expensive he's so
expensive to get this dog
so my brother Dale after searching for a
long time he was like why don't you just
post on Craigslist that you're looking
for a dog and I was like what after I
posted on Craigslist I'm not even
kidding calling one hour later a breeder
a German Shepherd breeder emailed me
back and said hey I have to leave town I
have two puppies left if you want to
make the drive I'll give you one that's
that's where we got Zeus totally free
whoa I remember sitting in the backseat
with him the whole ride home cuz he was
why he was so scared he was this little
pup he was never little never but his
paws were like bigger than his body he
said could hardly walk it is right back
to work we have literally not stopped
and rookies really been pulling it uh so
what you're watching today is basically
me trying to pretend like I feel good
when I do not feel good I'm coming
around I'm feeling better but you guys
know how it is when you're sick hang on

nights are always the roughest like
