Madeline right now maybe we have to
clean their side whoever's not has left
well I do live like four of them yo how
fast they could clean your house up like
they just come over and pick up
everything so how it works is there's
two teams here and they're battling to
have the least amount object on their
side so they're basically throwing it
back and forth no you got to build one
of these you should mine would already
be in pieces there'd be like 100 parts
laying on the board up up the ferris
