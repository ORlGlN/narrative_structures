today it's already pretty hard and for
now we just got this crazy little flat
skatepark area she get the RC cars out
on this supposedly in the next two weeks
all the framing and roof will be on the
building I'm so excited that's gorgeous
let's go sirs all right so let me tell
you my idea today here's the thing like
oh I kind of getting some stuff set up
in here hey King do you want to try to
fly this with me I've never done it okay
so you guys know Traxxas sent me a
couple drones pretty freaking sweet
drones the holiness is they told me to
do whatever I want with these things to
make some fun videos so I have an idea
oh it's so nd that's replug it in oh
thank you oh my gosh it's super windy I
don't know way too windy for that
alright it's really freakin windy minute
actually ruins my whole plan you know
what you're doing it's too windy outside
Momo you fly inside Oh what do you mean
all know it's little fun oh I think like
really fragile in here is the pinball
machine and you're like youtube Plaxo
whatever do something silly that's the
picture a rare um I'm recording got you
oh that looks no do it again it looks so
crazy from the side that looks so bad
like that I got to readjust my current
rod ever a few days okay thanks for
filling bud man daddy paying you to be a
cameraman yes yeah three dollars an hour
baby way in this thing's supposed to
sync up and then we can fly
are you sinking on here I don't know
what I'm doing stinker
you wanna element
Bobby puts out angry
oh did you put a hole honey there's you
put all in the wall the blades just like
cut through the wall more importantly is
the drone all right let's see action
from that stupid rats your protection
okay it's an outside toy bottom line
unless it's windy outside which it is I
think we can just put some bubble gum or
something over how did you lift that up
but haha oh my god Kane how do you do
that let me see I can do it now it's so
heavy hey dude you have the touch oh I
can catch it
mommy is strong this is like what are
you doing
lanessa ah alright perfect timing the
Sun setting Dale brought this what I was
talking about earlier
he brought Dragon's Breath shotgun
shells we haven't seen we've showed
these in the blogs for they basically
shoot it's like a flame thrower
basically pretty much them
Dale's a good drone flyer better than me
you saw the race video yeah but this is
a better this is bigger one yeah yeah
he's gonna fly the drum I'm gonna shoot
flames at it let's see what happens I
think we know it's gonna happen we know
it's gonna happen I'm gonna buy two back
alright so we had to wait for the Sun to
go down to really be out of CD shells
it's got light alright so this is my
little KSG it holds a ton of rounds like
14 rounds let's load this baby up hang
on um I'm onna she saying money
I don't mind I've got you I've got you
in my mind so what exactly is Dragon's
Breath this is a pretty famous shell now
shoots a hundred feet of fire setting
everything in its path a blaze warning
extreme fire hazard that sounds exactly
like my kind of mo you got film for us
we got the perfect skylight yeah this is
gonna be great
alright good racing
Wow
it's pretty wet today
on man vs. wild vs. wild fire no roaming
outwards taken didn't realize it shot
like a giant flame back here and these
are all loose I'll see you I smell it I
smell it
well we're downwind so it's coming from
this way here it is Zeus bound he's
putting it out that genuinely freaked me
out dude
I didn't realize everything back here is
really dry I thought everything was wet
it's been rainy yeah well he said hey
let's do it at your house and like
alright here's the thing as much as I
want to blow this thing out of thin air
what's up
from who oh crap
uh I was just interrupted by a crazy
phone call dude
next time we'll get it in the rain
during the rain while it's raining I'm
gonna fly next time you think you're
this way these guys are like what group
or shoot dude up actually most you
probably don't want to see this get shot
how meny you want to see a shot how meny
don't want to see you I feel I don't
want to really kill the thing it's
awesome I mean you can do a Twitter poll
that's wonderful hang Reimers from it so
if they catch fire and then it goes ah
oh ah I feel like that was such a
disappointment we'll get you
we're gonna get you let me take a second
to explain to you guys what it's like to
be at this kind of level of a youtuber
most of our day is phone calls computers
like you're dead you're beat she might
be getting what I had from the time Dale
was just here to the time we were out
there I've had to 35 minute phone calls
an hour and 10 minutes worth of phone
calls
I saw you feeling around it really does
become a double-edged sword one side of
things is you're becoming successful if
you're getting these phone calls and
there's emails and business
opportunities and and the other side of
things is that all takes away from what
made you successful so it's it's such a
hard balance to find and I'm you know
I've never done it never been in this
position so I'm still learning how to do
it hi baby
I almost had to use Brittany's battle
body right here today thank goodness I
didn't me that scared me guys you've
never seen me like that no what is it on
fire what it does like we wouldn't want
to see it on fire ah I hate fire that is
something I'm terrified of my car you
guys see my very first video ever
uploaded on my main channel fire my car
does catches fire in the middle of the
road ever since then it brought me like
something wrong with me it's a I hate
fire absolutely amazing burger I'm going
to cover the pickles onions so I based
my whole vlog around blowing this uh
drone up tonight and I freaked out I
don't want to catch the woods on fire I
mean it would be a pretty epic vlog if
all the woods were on fire but so now
I'm like crap I kind of let down myself
today that is all I got today I'm gonna
hang out with Kenan Britt maybe watch a
movie I have to edit this vlog tonight
got a big day tomorrow yeah that's it
today man tell me in the comments below

hanging out I'm feel like I'm almost
100% back I felt so good today
night time hit and I'm little I think
you guys can hear it whatever we'll push
through it thank you guys again and
