sure does daddy have toes alright guys
so I have something I really need to
talk to you guys about and tell you
about and I want your advice on it I
think you're gonna agree with me I think
almost everyone will agree with me this
is what I want to do all right this is
kind of a big announcement I've been
giving this a lot of thought over the
last few weeks and this is what I want
to do I love making pranks I love going
on the streets and goofing off and
having fun with my friends with a camera
and a mic that's what started me on
YouTube that's what I love doing and I
just want to explain to you guys the
type of pressure that I have making
pranks now it's very big now it's it's I
can't just go out on the streets anymore
you know there's a billion pranksters on
YouTube doing that and I just feel like
I'm just another one of them so I'm
always trying to
one up myself doing massive pranks take
a month of planning and it's just too
long for you guys it's too long for you
too my own expect you guys to wait that
long for a prank it's unfair so here's
what I'm thinking
I want to go do these things every day I
want to go out when I have fun I want to
make pranks goofy pranks fun prank silly
Franks that being said that's what I'm
going to do but here's my plan all of
these fun pranks these goofy pranks he
silly pranks and me going out and doing
what I did when I started YouTube will
go on this channel all of them I will
now be uploading fun pranks maybe some
are crazy maybe some are real simple
maybe a little maybe they're one minute
long maybe they're four minutes long
they will be going on this channel along
with everyday vlogs I will not skip
vlogs you'll still get vlogs think of it
as bonus you don't got to wait a month
for a prank because guys my prank
channel is very precious to me it's it's
strictly quality over quantity and I
feel like on the vlog channel I can have
fun and you guys appreciate it
if I was out making pranks plus vlogs
it'd be more entertaining I think so
hear me out the prank channel will only
be reserved for my big pranks big pranks
things that I spent a lot of money a lot
of time a lot of effort in they will
still run it's just you guys are waiting
a month and a half for pranks now so
here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna
keep doing that stuff big pranks but
those big pranks will live on that
channel but when I go out on the streets
and I want to have fun and I want to go
out making pranks they will go on this
channel I think it's a great idea and I
thought about this a long time how do I
keep making fun pranks without putting
them on the main channel there's a lot
of pressure on that channel guys I I
mentally I can't I can't upload little
street pranks there's just too many
there's too many people doing that I
like to be different so the main channel
still roll out the big dogs
there you know to what I think are going
to be great and this channel I'm still
going to do it I do every day plus
pranks hope you guys like it because I'm
about to roll it hard and we're about to
go really hard with a whole new a whole
new thing so that is the big
announcement price will now be on this
channel and only my biggest best pranks
were all on my main channel reserving
that channel to be the greatest and
making this channel just my life and
what I do and I think going out on the
streets and pulling pranks is what I do
that's more part of my life so you guys
will just you can get it all that's
gonna be awesome channel is about to go
