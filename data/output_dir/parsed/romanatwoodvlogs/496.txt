Britney flew in hey baby mmm this is
always amazing moment when she gets here
especially on tour cuz like I just said
the beginning was true I get lonely I'm
used to having Britney in the kids
around and my dogs and like I always
have family around and when I'm actually
on the road and a hotel sleeping by
myself it's weird like I'm just not used
to it so Britney's here we already
started what we were running incredibly
late I didn't even have time to shop
I've been wearing these pants for three
days today might be the fourth day no to

my girl I got my boy huh I thought it
was fake Oh pineapple drink here we go
let's do this straight to the venue
where it is Chicago baby that looks good
usually usually we get to the venue's
early because we have soundcheck we have
meet and greets and usually there's
there's a fair amount of people outside
but I just saw the line whoa Chicago is
gonna be nuts
dumpster country we hear we hear
dumpster there Gavin there Devon come
back all right here we go what up you

brother out there like you're good so
we're walking right down low we split us
up we're walking right now - walking
right now check out this menu holy moly
whoa
okay guys so tonight we actually have to
get permission from the venue to fly the
drone usually we just fly it but this
venue was very strict and told us that
we cannot fly this drone in their
building we got the owner here or I
think he's the owner basically making
foo see fly the drone in front of him to
prove that he can do it and we have to
pay $1,500 just a vlog here
so this vlog has already cost 1500 bucks
oh it's fun turn around I'll try to go
underneath no no crazy during the show
we get them excited we go up we peak it
and come right back
thank you so much I mean awesome thank
you this connects Atlanta itself just
can't work land is so I completely lost
control
I'm just at the screen I was panicking
then I was like only showing off so
there's a penalty because any time we
broadcast footage I think they let you
do like an archive video over the show
but if you're gonna broadcast footage
like YouTube whatnot yeah it costs a lot
of money to do it we had to let go all
the way up to the top people and see if
it was approved and all that tell me
what you told me about you told the
venue that we're just putting it on our
post on YouTube channel ashes yeah well
at first I tried to Det you know before
we had to escalate I thought I could be
kind of sneaky and just say oh yeah it's
