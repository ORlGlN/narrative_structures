I can't even barely ride this to begin
with but we're gonna try to actually
pull each other on it when we run what's
the odds of this work you understand

running start and then they have to
outrun you it's gonna be so difficult I
lean back
your mom's like be careful oh my gosh
like tug of war down here how many
people got a pole all right this should
be good this should be good oh oh oh
take three you're gonna need some type
of speed to start you got to be move in
a run and do it like a normal skin war
buddy who's got the rugs okay this is
foolproof it's just full bro I think you
should hop on the board show em how it's
done you know
if you think and just imagine my waking
fun at 40
I might just you know take my little
board for each foot we'll get to go
it's doable there it works it's amazing
