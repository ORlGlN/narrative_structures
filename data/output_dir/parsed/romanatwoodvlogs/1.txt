welcome to today's video we're just
gonna jump right into this because it's
there's really no easy way to say this
or go about it I'm just gonna jump right
into it today I'm officially announcing
that this will not be a daily vlog
channel anymore now that doesn't mean
that I may not go ten days in a row with
a vlog I might I might still do it but
right now I don't want you guys to
assume that I'm gonna upload every
single day I know that sounds crazy like
I've thought about there's so much I'm
kind of going insane about it yesterday
when I didn't upload I put that Twitter
video out like seriously scared of you
guys like I'm like that's that's a real
feeling that I'm just joking about um
he's stressed out I don't know I don't
know what it is like I think we see this
happen with you know most daily vloggers
that it's just I have reached a mental
point where I kind of want to create
something bigger like I want to do more
like weekly movies like imagine a 90
minute vlog that comes out or even a new
channel like like let's like I want to
do something new like that's the honest
truth like the God's honest truth I want
to do something new and fresh and big
and like maybe more exciting I I will
obviously always still upload videos
like I want to do vlog still but I just
right this moment three weeks could go
by and I'm like yeah let's start daily
vlogging again that could happen easily
my mind is crazy sometimes like I I I
get these ideas and I have to do it I
have to try and right now daily vlogging
is is the old if you daily vlog that's
like the only thing you can really do
and I want to try like I don't know I
want to try new things daily vlogging is
weird like I know I don't expect anybody
to understand unless your daily vlogger
like it's it's weird and you've got it
for years it's done it for years and I
probably will continue to do it a little
bit all I'm saying is like if I don't
upload tomorrow I like just make that
become normal like I don't want it to be
like Monday through Sunday there's a
vlog there better be a vlog or you're a
piece of crap like I just want this to
be our channel now and we'll still
follow our life and our kids and like I
said I
could be a week and I could be like yeah
let's just film all week let's film for
the next two weeks that could happen
like we're not going anywhere the
channel still gonna have videos going up
I think Casey nice that was such a great
example of this he quit his daily vlogs
his channel still rocks he still uploads
all the time he's still able to be as
creative as he wants to be and make
better videos he's a great example of
like what I'm talking about like oh I
don't know
I just want to put a pause let's just
call it a pause on daily vlogs right now
I know this sucks I know that's such a
bummer to hear but maybe something
bigger and more fun will come out of
that and maybe boulders pick the camera
up and blog again like I don't know but
for right now I'm stepping back a little
bit like let's just call it a little bit
of a step back I I need to figure out
what it is that I want to do next is it
to continue daily vlogging I don't know
like can it last forever now the channel
slowly declining and it's like you got
evolve you gotta move forward you can't
I think with any job or career you want
to change in some way whether it be
better or different and in your life at
some point you used to do pranks and
then you did vlogs and now pranks a huge
here's a huge example had I stayed only
as a prankster had I only had the Roman
Atwood prank channel my career would
have ended a very long time ago right
but I seen that happening I saw it
before anybody I said yo in another year
pranks will be dead we need to start
anew we need to evolve into the next
thing and that was vlogging I started
vlogging and everyone I hung out with
thought I was crazy like that's dude
that's so dumb in the vlogs are what it
took over it became bigger than the
prank saying like I'm not saying I'll
figure out the next big thing right like
that's not what this is about it would
be cool I wouldn't be against that
what's gonna make you happy in your life
next like in your career I think a lot
of this comes from the prank channel
I've seen what happened with pranks and
YouTube and how YouTube just killed it
off that pranks killed himself soft too
but ice evil ah I see youtubers having
this issue where it looks like looks
like we're being killed off like a lot
of us not me not just me a lot of
YouTube is being killed off right
I don't know what you can do your own
research but I want to you know figure
out do I want to just keep pursuing
vlogs as a career
do I want to vlog for the family do I
want to take some time to figure out
what we want to do as a family I know
this is super confusing probably a lot
of you are gonna give us a lot of hate
for this but I want to find something
new we're gonna try streaming on Twitch
if you haven't followed us go there
we're gonna start streaming Britney and
I are gonna she's never played fortnight
or battleground so I think we're just
gonna do a whole stream where we're
playing that we're still here we're
still gonna upload on this channel but
daily every single day is is kinda how
it's been right now I go like 10 days I
take a couple days off I think that's
okay and I think that may be normal for
this channel now like I don't want to
say we're not uploading like we're gonna
we're gonna still rock still gonna we're
still gonna be here still gonna push you
guys we're still gonna motivate you guys
we're still gonna do all that on all
other social medias - yeah but the daily
the the the thought that you have that
we upload every day I need I want that
to end I don't want to be known as a
daily vlogger anymore I want to just
upload when we upload that's a YouTube
channel so I want to start a new YouTube
channel that's that's where my head's at
right now I want to start a new here's
what I want to do if you're still
listening I want to start a new YouTube
channel and I where I upload much bigger
projects like imagine maybe you only get
four videos a month but they're just
like movies they're like fun they're
like you know you name it that's good
that's kind of where my head's at that's
all I have I don't know that anything I
just said is different from what's
actually happening right now
like we upload kind of when we want
right now but I've been fighting to
upload every day and I want to kind of
step back from that that's what this is
all about I just don't want the pressure
of like you have to upload or your
viewers are gonna kill you I've been
doing a lot of talking you want to talk
do you wanna say anything reason thank
you
he's hurt other than that thank you guys
for everything no matter what we do I
know there'll be a lot of you that come
with us no matter where we go if we
start a new channel you'll come if we go
to twitch you'll come thank you so much
it's it's unreal it's a blessing it's
it's truly impossible to me that we have
you and we'll always be thankful for
that and I think I just I think I just
want a break from daily that's all
that's it that's what it is my mind's
going crazy guys the pressure of being a
big youtuber is it sounds so ungrateful
and like I've done this so long that
like I hear you like I understand but
I've heard a lot of great vloggers in
the past talk about how it starts to
mentally beat you up and I always
thought that was crazy I always didn't
understand it maybe that comes as your
view start to drop you start to stress
out more I feel that I'll be honest like
as your views drop you start freaking
out maybe that's where the mental starts
coming in like where I hear vloggers say
you know vlogging is gonna hurt you I
think that comes with the view drop
that's what hurts like nobody really I
don't know we love you guys
I'm just ranting now I'm just venting
it's all good
like I don't bring anybody down I want
this to stay positive it's still our
family channel we're still gonna rock
out we're still gonna take you guys
everywhere we go just right this moment
I just want to step back for a moment
that's it that's all hope you guys are
okay with that I'm gonna get a ton of
hate on this video so please like this
video hit that like button for me if
you're real viewer I know if you're
