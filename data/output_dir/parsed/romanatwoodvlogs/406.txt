welcome to the vlog guys hope you are
having an awesome day I just got a bunch
of off-camera crap done that just
honestly you wouldn't want to be any
part of it pretty laid-back day so far
honestly uh just a bunch of things I
want to get done off camera and you know
with the Christmas time coming up blogs
are tough because if I've loved certain
things and certain family members know
what they're getting for Christmas
they're gonna be very secretive with
that I also want to say again and again
thank you so much we hit 10 million
yesterday on the old dusty Frank Channel
channel I haven't touched for probably
eight months you guys absolutely smashed
the channel blowing all the dust off and
making me get back into it so I promised
you that when I hit ten million I would
do a new prank so that is kinda what I'm
working on what's that print gonna be
what am I going to do I plan on doing
something fun very clean something fun
for the family maybe out in the streets
and just you know back to the roots
prank that all being said I don't know
if it's true or not but I got word that
I may be the first person to ever
receive two diamond play buttons in the
United States
all of America I could be now I don't
know this is true or not I just got a
little birdie told me that this is a I'm
not gonna say until it's true and I'm
not gonna get my hopes up because
honestly if I am the first person in all
the United States received to Don and
lay buttons that's quite the honor that
is quite the honor to me guys and
whether I am or not thank you for being
here
thanks for being a part of it thank you
for making it happen I obviously wanted
to have any of it without you so let's
get the vlog started it is a laid-back
day it's great it's uh you know this is
what it is tomorrow's the shooting
contest and I am talking way too much
let's change camera angles let's get
home knock knock
daddy's home hey Zeus hey flash hey Brit
hey Kane what does that mean I wanted to
silly-string you but we couldn't find oh
that's because I hid it so good he gave
me oh I really wanted to just plow you a
silly-string today Oh too bad so sad
how's my baby
yeah little great hmm kind of rushing
around today and as promised we have new
products to release and that means
photos and when you think of like a
company or like it headers how are you
happy favorite yeah what do you think of
like a company or like a website you
expect like a big photo shoot and all
this crazy stuff but it's really just me
and my family and we set up we set up a
white backdrop and couple tripods and
like one light and we literally take the
photos on this camera if my cousin
Ashley isn't here to take photos so it's
super mom-and-pop shop right here and
he'll remembers when this used to be in
our old house who remembers when we had
a few boxes not much bigger than this
with a few t-shirts in it like who
remembers those days we're getting a
couple orders a week like it's crazy now
we got all these shelves and employees
and family members working for us who
could have ever predicted Animal Planet
Animal Planet's such a huge company
would come to our little home and build
a friggin fish tank for our company man
anyways let's keep going wait on Britt
she has to do actually some girls
products for you guys are coming
and one other thing I want to tell you
guys something I want to tell you
something that I learned um if you're
trying to start a company like
especially take it from me like I meet a
lot of people and they're like oh once I
get this and once I get that once all
these people are chip in and once I get
all their help I'm gonna start this
thing I'll be honest with you guys you
can do it yourself like you really can
like you'd be so surprised how much you
can do on your own you don't know how
many companies how many fulfillment
centers
how many much larger businesses contact
us every single week to handle
everything that we do and we still to
this day do it all ourselves we do
everything right here at our home man
you would just be so surprised how much
you can do how much you are capable you
can actually do it on your own man
businesses are so different than they
used to be you can do it in your house
now I mean that's where I started
Brittany and I started handwriting
orders with a freaking bin I still
there's probably vlogs of Brittany
handwriting orders and use that as
motivation you can do don't expect
success overnight like smile Moore
wasn't successful when I started it
takes a lot of time it takes takes a lot
of time just like the YouTube channels
I'm so many years deep into YouTube
channels like it looks like it happened
overnight but this is years in years of
our life and dedication for what we love
to do it doesn't even feel like work
it's it's passion and like I always say
money is the byproduct of doing what you
love do what you love first watch what
happens I promise you watch what happens
I don't want to bore you guys today but
these are things we got to get done part
of our business part of our company and
I'm really bringing you along usually I
would skip this or just show you a quick
clip like hey we're doing photos but
it's a laid-back day so this is what
we're doing and I hope you can still
enjoy it get something from it take
something from it man I don't want you
guys to watch these vlogs just for
entertainment purposes I want you to
take something from them I want you to
learn something I want you to better
yourself so I want you to become better
versions who you are right now and it's
extremely important to me that's one of
the reasons I vlog to this day not just
for my memories to lift you guys up and
know I have learned a lot through all
this and I want to pass it along to you
man
we have to all work together imagine if
we were all helping each other who yes
you got to do
things yourself yeah you got to set your
own tripods up in your own photo areas
yeah you got to do it yourself but
that's what's fun about it man when you
put your hands on it your love and your
passion nobody will love what you do
more than yourself and you have to do it
yourself that's what makes it so genuine
makes it that's what makes it and a lot
of people don't understand that they
want it they want to tell this person to
do that job but that person doesn't
really love that job so they're not
going to do it the way you would want it
done you got to get your hands or you
got to work on things yourself sometimes
now there is times where you do run out
I mean we've hired so many people now
that work for us and you do have to do
that and finding people that genuinely
want to help you like family is key
however for my entrepreneurs out there
you you do got it you got to do it
yourself man at least get it going and
then maybe you can you know divide that
time out with other people but even
after all that we've done man you can't
believe what we do ourselves it's fun I
love it let the paper draw oh it's dirty
find something you love guys I said all
the time find something you love and
just attack it go after it just pursue
it with all you have man the only person
that can stop you is yourself
is your mind your mind can trick you can
be your best friend it can be your
biggest enemy you have to tell your
brain what you want you have to go get
it our first model is mommy damn damn
damn damn Britney with the new pink uh
it's like uh it's got like a faded look
it's like a comfy look it's like a
pajama look what is it I don't know whoo
all right guys so this is one of our
newest hoodies and these are uh just
female hoodies I guess guys could wear
em but I think the girls are gonna love
them I don't know how to explain it
it's like something you almost like
watch a movie in it's like something you
cuddle up on the couch with when you're
sick you know I mean it sort of reminds
me of anyway let's knock out some
pictures and yeah yeah this is weird
because I'm doing photos on this camera
which means I have to stop recording to
take the pictures like that next up we
got the
purple hoodie why am I talking like that

unique purple is it's like got this like
