back in October but this thing basically
goes on land and water full that camera
goes on land and water there's any
bigger a need luggage hand right but now
you can zoom all across and put numbers

running some trails yeah Dale okay

boy has been Noah has been on a trip so
he hasn't been in the vlogs for like
eight days maybe so that has really
sucked he got back right now like you

missed you like crazy I know a lot of
you guys are some comments where is Noah
so he had a wonderful trip that he went
on his crazy and now we're trail riding
over
all right we found we what happened
buddy what happened we have found a bit
of water that it looks like a good spot
I mean not not here obviously it's more
than hoof prints those are hooves
so we're thinking there's a nice spot
over here it will drive the Argo into
the water and we'll take the this this
stream just see what I mean I'm really
just saying we get enough use that we
just sit him off the cliff here sit 10
million likes that really likes doable

the country cream beer start a kid and
look what's going on he told me it was
face wash two hours later
I can't shave it Oh got the country the
five o'clock country

rail on the rack oh by the way that's
the camera started the vlog with yeah
there's me a nice comparison

experienced in arrow this old Indian
arrow Savage so we are rolling through
some trails right now trying to find a
good spot to get in that water
