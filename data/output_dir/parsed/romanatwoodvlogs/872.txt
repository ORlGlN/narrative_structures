to have a safety meeting about the prank
today you bet you got a camera for your
anybody comes to the tank so you're
filming the safety meeting I am good for
you man yes I'm gonna have to clue me in
on like how to be safe we're actually
doing it
I have Viacom safety over here hey I
have an armor I'm terrible things are
please Kirk Kirk's probably be with you
guys on the firing line but he's be very
specific about the guns what we're doing
with the guns and there's going to be
very strict rules so I know you guys go
out of shoot guns but because we're
doing this prison for the show was a
very specific way we have to do things
so just listen to Kirk and it'll be a
good direction for you other thing too
is when you're firing blanks and you
brought some weapons up here know that
it will feel probably like it's not
firing
you'll hear the noise but it's just it's
not enough you don't have around going
out the end
yeah okay and shut the dust cover right
now and this is this one's ready for the
handed one they are running test firing
for these real fully automatic machine
guns that would be full of blank
ammunition they'll be shooting at
grandma's car so they're just going over
all the safety and things that they have
to do procedures they are getting ready
for test-fire right now go ahead and
pull it back see that's all it was a
design comes in so it has to be hot when
you rack okay then you bring it up to
the safety welcome to nature the a K
okay okay so this is a super super huge
day for us guys we've got fully
automatic machine guns we've got
pyrotechnics from the Avenger movies
