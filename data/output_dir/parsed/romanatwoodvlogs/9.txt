on the other side of the mountain and
then you can go I just need a bed so if

like that but it's like it hurts to
breathe in and out like it's like taking
my breath I got tricked like I tried to
take a breath in it just takes it out of

goes
would you push him down his bored
mountain
well it's snowing hard enough do you
need help oh no it's okay so okay so a
bunch of time has passed and we got to
that point where I was like do we got
the hospital or do we don't go the
hospital for some reason something's
just telling me to go I always try to
avoid going it's just like it's it's way
worse than like I don't know I think the
hurting - breathing hard to breathe kind

trying to be quiet there's other people
in the room beside me hope you're having
an awesome day like honestly no matter
what you're going through

stronger it's making you tougher and
it's building a better version of you
for tomorrow we're all going through
crazies to all of us I have something
we're going through right now I promise
you it's gonna make you better man like
this is crazy like I can't wait to just
figure out what this is because this is
something like honestly I've been had
nothing to do a snowboarding I've had
this problem from washing my hands like
one day I was washing my hands and this
happened I just locked up and I was in
bed for like three days so I just I I
think it's time to just kind of like say
hey this might be what it is and we
brittany send pictures to my mom I was
like what's wrong what's wrong what's
wrong how does my mom see my Twitter
how do you see my Twitter forgive me sir
it's not getting me stunts don't say
that for people okay we've got four four
votes for kidney stones from my family
oh my lens is destroyed
okay all right guys um nothing
uh-oh like such a baby um so the good
news is that all my blood work came back
great there's nothing wrong I was well a
little like this low on potassium which
I'd even know that was something you
could be low on apparently it is you can
be over possessing and under passive um
and they gave me what was it a muscle
relaxer yeah super light muscle relaxer
which I kind of had a panic attack
and everyone was laughing at me
including because I've never seen you
like freak out and Noah does this thing
where he like when he gets so worried
you can see in his face and all I saw
was nose worried okay I don't take
anything I have like Advil when I'm sore
or something so they didn't tell me it
like might make you you know really
tired or feel funny
I don't think it was a painful after I
had like three root canals in one day so
right now as of now nothing serious I
didn't do a CT scan cat scan which would
have been like the big one but the
doctor said that like early I'm not
showing those signs and even if there is
something I don't need to know about it
right this second it's gonna be so I'm
about at a 4 right now I told him I was
that pain level like 8 and I feel like
it's about half right now so I know it's
just the medicine but usually this last
three days offering it through today I'm
already on there of course I'd come back
to vlogging when I'm all team do
anything if you're actually still
watching Ryan thanks so much for
sticking around our Channel and you know
part of everything we do so it's so
bright out here from the ski lifts over
here that it almost looks like daytime
but it's not as I said I've got the best
girl in the whole world guys she
literally didn't ski at all all day we
got to go down what that that footage
you saw of me and laying on the ground
was we just started we didn't even go
down one time I told her all day I was
like go ski and go have fun and she said
I'm not going without you and she just
took me to the hospital the best in a
bath
alright guys I sure hate to bring
everybody down with this today I've had
not had not been myself really uh today
it's been a little weird but pretty much
all good news it's without doing the
major scans that weren't actually
suggested I'm pretty good it looks like
either muscle spasm with the hydration
um you know I was a little too
dehydrated so drink your water quit
grabbing the soda grab some more water
I'm going to try so hard for the next
week to drink water that is my goal cuz
last night at dinner at her birthday
dinner I was like she said what are you
getting the drinking I was like I am
craving what you know you need water
when you crave water right so I think it
was just I think that did I think it did
play a part in this I don't know it's
crazy I love you guys
it's a shame I had to come back to
vlogging in such a weird video but
thanks for being here as always we love
you you're beautiful you were one of a
kind smile
