lot different than probably any other
vlog we've ever done we are gonna try to
dig deep deep into my life into my
journey into my career from where I came
from to where I am now we're gonna try
to open up and explain all of this stuff
to you guys because today Maya flew in
from New York City
hi guys don't be shy she didn't want to
be in the vlog she's being shot hi body
for the next couple days Maya and I will
be working on my very first book yeah
that's right the guy that loves to read
so much is releasing a book I'm so
excited I love to read so much I know
well it's believe it or not it's been
massively requested the Roman why don't
you release a book not just a book that
you see in the vlogs every day but a
book that explains things that you've
never heard me say details Oh what have
you never told anybody do you really
want me to tell a story sure right now

you guys think I don't know it's gonna
hold all this crap so we don't have that
sitting out and Zeus slash mommy and
Kane got a new bed Hey
oh there's his new bed he's being shy my
just asked she just asked me that maybe
I should share a story maybe that would
be in the book or something and there
may be a chapter about we you know what
I think of my career what has happened
and I told her just it just came right
on my mouth that I think that the the
biggest success and everything that I
end up doing you know whether it's a
little bit of Fame or some money I think
the greatest success is everything that
I've done is maybe helping people
that's that's the crazy truth I had a
story come in through email of a guy
this is a hard story to explain and talk
about um I had a guy said he had a noose
around his neck ready to hang him so I'm
sorry this is getting deep but he was
about to hang himself when his phone
ding does like a ding and it was a
notification that Roman Atwood has
uploaded a new video and he got down to
check and he said he had to see this
video and I guess something I said in
the video he's now been alive six more
months so I can't I can I can tell you
my life like I do every day on the vlogs
but I can't put it on paper so she's
gonna she's gonna help me it'll just be
you on the paper just no really a
channel you on the paper smash my face
into it rub it all out on there some
guts yeah so I hope that wasn't too dark
but I get these stories every single day
and you can say what you want about me
you can talk crap but the fact is if
I've helped one person I feel
accomplished I feel successful and look
at this how can I not feel successful
look at this look what I've done
