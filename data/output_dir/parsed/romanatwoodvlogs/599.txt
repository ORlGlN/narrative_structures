your wish is my command look at this guy
look at him so pretty okay do you have a
sheet of paper get a sheet of paper as I
just read something that you're not
gonna believe I want you guys to try
this too ready yep career Kane check
this out
get like a printer paper get a piece of
printer paper
ah no to pull sighs so this is something
fun for everybody to try you could try
to Kane it says fact or crap all right
to the true or false it is impossible to
fold a sheet of paper in half more than
seven times seven folds that sounds so
easy so let's try it
I've never tried this in my life wow
yeah I don't know it's the specter crap
I don't know we have to prove it oh
here's the obvious one fold this is
crazy
Oh am I go in there fingers this one
across you give me chills
- whoa it's getting small fast three who
figured this out first of all there's
four folds and it's already hard okay
honestly before you did this I was like
seven would be so easy seven folds
that's only five
I can't do it crap all right so here's
what it says this this long-held myth
was busted by a popular TV show where
sheet of paper was folded in half 11
times but they started with a sheet of
paper the size of a football field and
used steam rollers to accomplish the
task so I would say a regular sheet of
paper you cannot you cannot hold SEC
wrath it's crap if you pour a handful of
salt into an entirely full glass of
water the water will not overflow and
the water level will go down I'm pulling
crap right the water has to go somewhere
oh yeah oh my gosh it didn't it did go
up a little yeah but it didn't overflow
but the water level didn't go down I
don't know what to say
I don't even know to say we are we're
all now dumber having doing that hockey
pucks were originally made from chunks
of frozen cow poop that it's just too
bizarre not to be true right right I
thought that's what they still used fact
oh yeah they were really made out of cow
dung when I oh you can't even figure
that out awesome so I want them to your
helmet on let's do this dee doo dee dee
