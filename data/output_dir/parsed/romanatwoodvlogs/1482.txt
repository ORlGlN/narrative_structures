we just got to the middle of sport sweet
corn festival this is a yearly yearly
event here happens every year and I've
been here every year in my life
I grew up across the street and we would
just walk here every single year
great have some fun no no buzz magazine
couldn't ride in the stroller huh Cain
you go ride some rides yeah you go ride
some rides yeah definitely the slide and
the merry-go-round it's the most badass
wheelchair I've ever seen in my life
I used to chicken it out
the most dangerous ride at the whole
place
you're on the horse
no it was in there supporting his little
brother riding the kiddy rides I'm proud
of him he looks so funny
whoa you need a bigger fish man so proud
of him it looks a little bit too a 20
month old kid I wouldn't write it i
don't even write it now it seems to be
one of my favorite rides the swing okay
you won't ride the slide they won't let
him he's not tall enough so you would
dominate that slide wouldn't you I don't
know so many rules regulations I'm gonna
do the trampoline
you got to go higher than anybody all
right do it
watch no okay let's go watch him Cain
wants to do this so bad he's like trying
to climb the gate and everything
Oh
they will do anything to ride this and
you want to ride that I know you can't
you're not big enough he's getting good
at it now

Payne

the guy here is hooking Cain up he's
seen him trying to get over the gate
desperately he's gonna let Cain try this
he gonna do it man
so excited over there he gets a job
other than five days a year this place
is empty and expanded all year so this
is where we rode our bikes every single
day hung out played as kids awesome is
the coolest place and all these little
buildings are still set up so you get
through like sneak into them and that's
about it

thought I would beat 57 that's I can't
even do the speed limit yeah battery
