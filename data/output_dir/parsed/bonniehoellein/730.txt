my hair so I could take a shower and

amazing at that he is so great at just
giving me just 30 minutes just give me
30 minutes so I can shower without a
kids hand reaching in and grabbing me or
something you know um so it was just
really nice to be able to get ready and

way to school I was watching her and she
heard the four-wheeler start up but she
just started bawling she's like I don't
