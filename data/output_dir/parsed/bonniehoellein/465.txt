you
that's okay t-ball you're not going to
be bending
that was a little big
you may not be able to meander this yet
we got to break it in
yeah
so I want to tell a quick little story
when I was young and I was playing on my
competitive team I was like how about 12
playing on that team and I've been
struck out and I thought that the
pitches were all way outside I thought
the UMP was out of his mind
so I got mad and I threw my back I was
terrible sportsmanship awful so after I
threw the bat and the UMP gave me a
second chance to stay in the game I went
out the left field because I'm a left
fielder and a pop fly came started
coming at me and also and I ran in and
the Sun went straight into my eyes so I
just put my mitt here to protect my face
but I didn't even see where the ball
went until it hit me right off the top
of my head and it hurts so bad
so sneaking bad but it bounced so high
off my head that our shortstop ran out
and caught it and got the guy out so I
still assisted in the out but I think I
think that was karma a little bit like
Joel change your attitude have some fun
or I'm gonna put a baseball to your head
kind of thing I don't know if I got one
good memory out of today alone it's that
look at me code look at me
look at that little guy just is that
your bat and ball okay look
stand there can you hit one to me should
we try you ready okay OOP we try again

this one
you are ready for some baseball Bud Cody
car Colleen on deck all right I've got
the biggest dilemma the mitt that Cody
really likes it's red it's flashy that's
like useful her has really good
dexterity it's not even leather it's
like cheap junk and I can't buy him a
mitt that he's not going to have forever
he's not going to use it forever but
he's got to have it forever so we're
switching a little bit Cody likes that
one it's got a strap Cody show me you
can pick up a ball with Allen squeeze it
hard squeeze art oh you did it is that
gonna go squeeze hard again please like
this go like that there you go put it in
the cone you ice cream cone it he'll get
it but I think we're going to switch the
mitt ha I really want to show you
something special to me okay these are
all of Daddy's mitts that's the one I
played with in high school this is the
one I played with in junior high and me
and my brothers actually all shared that
mitt and this is the one I started with
that was my first mitt but I want to
show you this mitt Jenni who's this one
else
you can't pause that was my dad's
grandpa Halloween's look at this myth is
that cool or what as a little kid I
remember rooting through my dad's closet
I don't even know what I was looking for
but anyway I remember stumbling upon
this I'm ever stumbling upon this mitt
and from then on I've known I wanted it
and a few years back my dad found it
again and gave it to me and now we're
starting with your baseball mitt and
your bat and some balls
thank you for watching manly things and
tonight is Cody's first game and I'm
excited as heck that we get to go watch
and participate as a family with him I
really nice time
