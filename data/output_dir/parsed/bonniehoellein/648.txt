you know what men only get more
attractive the older they get most of
them like my brother Bo every time I see
him I'm like you are flipping handsome
and you didn't used to be this handsome
and Joel I think he just I think well I

handsome and even if you have no hair
and I'm expecting everyone to back me up
on this

you'll be just as handsome it doesn't
matter think Donald Trump alone me
something is a bit but excess okay we're
gonna say good night you're gonna get in
the shower and I'm probably gonna go sit
oh should we show what I got to bury
okay I I had to get a bigger size who's
this for
well Boxton it's for the new baby but I
just got a newborn size and then one for
when he's bigger cuz I thought it was
too cute and then I literally wasn't
gonna try and put that off you don't
have any other onesies for the baby
so there's one that says play ball and I
thought that one was super cute yeah
just a striped one a ball one and then
