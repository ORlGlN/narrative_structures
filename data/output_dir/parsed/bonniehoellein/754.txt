so a tradition my parents have is every
year they've been married they buy a
Christmas bulb and this one is 1975 this
is the very first one they ever bought
all of these on the tree I mean since
the Star Wars one that one was a year I
mean all these I look at all these and I
remember him when I was a little kid
just sitting by the tree and just
listening to it Clank and singing and
and just do all kinds of things but
there's foam for every single year how
many are they 38 37 bulbs so I think we
had a pretty successful design okay well
