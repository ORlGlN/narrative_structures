okay you guys want to find red whoa oh
wow
look he found these things Oh so I
remember in toy store in Toy Story
good things in that jar yeah so Boston
can't talk to him elleny well and so he
doesn't get shot yeah that was good
thinking red that's pretty smart
good job Alfio teach it you can't touch
him now nope but I can't believe it
how could we find him so fast because
you guys are just quick and because red
kinda stays in the same spots maybe
that's right as comfortable you think
you know they don't have well yeah they
did can you see him in there
look that's that gun right there
yeah you enjoying that milk oh good
ah look at Bonnie's beautiful
decorations on the tree I like moms

decoration oh I love that sock
decoration that's just fancy schmancy hi
mom hey red I hope you're not too
cramped in there all day
hey it's in there I was getting to get
out I don't know I was gonna break a
hole no no how can you find that jar I
bet he came in Cody's room got in his
closet and got him to probably tiptoe
