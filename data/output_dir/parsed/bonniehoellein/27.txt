yesterday at church we drew a mustache
on Boston and we told him that we wiped
it off what we really did it
and when our neighbor asked about it he
was like wait what I have a mustache and
I was like yeah I told you I wiped it
off but I really didn't and our neighbor
thought that was so funny I've never
seen him worse
I have a question does everyone think
that I should allow Boston to continue
to wear those jammies since but or if I
should give them to tear they're kind of
little on you you do
I'm not so sure a hundred percent
coincidence but I said we really to Ruby
and Sarah I'm gonna intervene his house

like these are so cute I need blinds in
my kitchen and she thought they were
super cute and he's like oh we went to
