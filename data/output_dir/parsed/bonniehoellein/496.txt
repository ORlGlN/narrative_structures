if I got you a big cousin or a baby
present or a girl present what do you

could tell you that you're not getting a
real formula why because you're too
little for a real formula high and five

teach you you can have a big formular or
real for dinner when you're just being a
little older when I count six maybe I

Cody come up and see his little getup
and he's waiting patiently on this
stairs do you want to come upstairs and
see the table cat we're gonna let Cody
choose which one he wants so there's an
Iron Man with gloves there's a Captain
America with the shield which you know
what this is my favorite or there's
spider-man's claws or their look at
these gloves with the Hulk or there's
just Batman and Batman doesn't have
anything to go with it so I'm gonna let

that no one was coming to his birthday
present because it's on a Wednesday
you're just gonna have a little party
well I called Ruby and I said Cody found
out that no one was coming and he wants
Russell and Chad and Jackson and Cooper
to all come to his birthday party and
she said I said what would you do and
she said it was my older kids I would
tell him too bad cuz they asked for
everything blah blah blah but if it was
my sweet wrestle which is Cody's age she
said if it was Haman he was asking I
would make it happen and like what am I
supposed to do I want to hi Quan say hi

like you know what I'll just be there so
much make it happen so I just told my
brother I was like rubies coming up like
