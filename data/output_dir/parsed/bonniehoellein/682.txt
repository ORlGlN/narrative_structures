nice day for bought for Olivia's recital
so today's my recital and my mom and dad

yet are you nervous
I don't like ballet that much yes you do
you're just saying that look it's not
even on your face sweetie you are just
saying that you like ballet
no I down I really hated it can you do
you honestly hate her or you just being
silly
don't I that's what I thought I like to
do that I like to trick my dad are
sometimes hey I do have a question and
your did your ballet teacher say no
makeup or can you put some lipstick on
lipstick okay that's what I thought
and nobody tennis shoes on picking
lipstick you want it has to be pink
dozens aren't really lipsticks when I'm
gonna do those ones thang something soft
because I doubt your teachers going to
want you to have anything crazy on like
that one that was a little well that
one's not really soft but because when
you want you know what we want the color
of your nylons and I think I have one
which one is it okay I have this one
