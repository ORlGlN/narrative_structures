whoa Lincoln's like okay I'm backing up
here I'm watching it
what's the fellow you just beat Cody's
you look Michaels pendant whoo
you just beat Cody's well while I make
the kids sandwich I don't know if we
told you guys and where joel has been
the last couple of days he recorded a
clip before he left explaining where he
was going but I couldn't use the clip
because I had some things in the
background that I couldn't have shown
and I didn't know how to blur it our I
mean I guess I could have figured it out
but I just it was late and I had all the
kids so I didn't take the time to do it
I still ate as a clip and it was really
cute Hugh such a sweetheart
so where he is he is at high adventure
he's with the young men's so in our
church Joel works with the young men and
he is perfect for it because he cares
about the young men in our ward very
much he cares for them he has a vested
interest in how they are how they turn
out and how they turn into men and so
and he I just think Joel is so relatable
and good and he's just he is just good
and being outdoors teaching them I think
they went up to a ranch and they're
teaching the boys to men spend like I
wish I could watch July's prefer to be
on the side watching Joel men in the
same anyway I'm going to feed these kids
they are they are speed and then I'm
probably going to catch up on The
Bachelor catch up on any other show that
piques my interest and enjoy my night
and you guys will see Joel in tomorrow's
