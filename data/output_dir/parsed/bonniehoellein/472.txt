good morning you look handsome got a
date with a floor
git-r-done morning Bevers money well
this is not the correct tunes we need
for hey work music is country music okay
I'll get you some country music I can
get on that and good morning to you too
dancing all my on these hardwood floors
the hardwood floors are actually much
thinner than we kind of thought huh as
you hand here yep see what I'm sayin
this is just like one they've been
damaged it's not between the hardwood
floor and the subfloor is very minimal
and probably is like three quarters of
an inch total which is one layer of a
new homes subfloor now so when we put
the new hardwood floor on we will be
adding a thicker flooring it will be a
lot more leather and wobbly it will it
will stiffen things up make things a
little better and this will be a nice
morning of this yeah this good wood and
this is pretty typical because like this
there's like patchwork right here with
no wood under it and then all over the
place is like patchwork stuff like that
so it really is going to be good that

just excited that our little town

Ellie's house you like that do ya okay
so a lot of people did want to know how
does Joel know how to do all this stuff
he just learned as you've gone I've
learned as I've gone trial and error
I've done a lot of this work for money
in college I did a lot of over when you
were laid off of work one time but he
did a lot of handiwork for other people
and that's what God does that's like
what pay their bills I think where I
learned a lot of it Noah was in high
school I worked for this carwash
conglomerate whatever and the owner was
building an apartment in his airplane
hangar how cool is that
it was awesome one time Joel took me
there as like a date
we kissed a lot I learned how to do a
lot of a hands-on the the boss just took
me under his wing and Tommy he did and
we thought so that was right before
Joel's going on his mission and we
thought he was going to come home and we
thought we were gonna live there like I
knew that's where we were gonna live
together like oh oh yeah I was like yeah
Bristol let us live in the apartment I
didn't know him we the our very first
apartment was the size of the living
room so from so from that wall to this
wall that was we had a studio apartment
it was old it was nasty it was dirty but
that's where we lived for our first
apartment I don't have to show you this
old door for you to remember it was in
the background of all of our videos
every time I added it I was like all
that door looks so bad I can't believe
new door I am so excited
so excited well I'll be nice to eat
something that's not take out okay come
sit down everybody
thank you yes okay everyone come sit
down okay hey there's AA barbeque

do it's very good it's like so good oh
well germs our grandfathers to shape
dinosaurs
check out the clothes on this door good
job Joel like that yeah go my favorite
part about three models is what my
little spectator me yeah
Bonnie is sat with me through all of us
whether on the floor just talking with
me going over step and I love it
I wouldn't do it any other way walk
around different from laughing let me
open this door
might not be doing work for watching her
yeah well Bonnie has plenty of work oh I
mean they're dead hey is that a good
workout bud oh he's making sure the door
is level he's making sure that it closes
evenly it's right
he just been learning from his old man
good job big guy thanks for fixing the
door that I'm gonna rip out bad
appreciate it
maybe he's trying to rip it out for me
come on y'all oh you're hurt
that's right he's got to make the door
cute he's gonna start gnawing on a
handle here in a minute I had someone
asked me why I was so picky about my
kids not scratching the walls if I have
old walls and I knew I was going to be
replacing them anyway and I thought it
was a really good question to ask
because I don't think a lot of people
would know my answer so we had old walls
and I still was very protective of the
kids like scratching balls hitting walls
and that's because if they don't know
how to treat the old walls nice how are
they supposed to know how to treat the
new walls all growing up we were told
like whether you have something nice new
fold ragged you take care of it so if I
didn't teach my kids how to take care of
the walls when I had old walls they
would not know how to take care of my
new office so what's the same the same
attitude you have when you have crap is
the same attitude you'll out when you
add new so you better have a good outdo
and appreciated attitude when you have
crap or nothing that was easy
oh oh you scared and do see a job at the
pimples to do it again
no boogies yeah buggy buggy buggy yep
we're all a hot mess oh that's too keen
Thank You Italy you are the best
Gavin kids are in bed I am going to edit
Joel what's your plan sweetie
don't look in there yeah right link it
has been horrible like going to bed
lately don't let him see you
I've been wanted I usually just close
this door but I want to go in and check
his diaper because he's had lots of
diarrhea when you hit me

it and then we're gonna watch a show
watch a show okay good night guys fight
