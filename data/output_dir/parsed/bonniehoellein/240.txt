Joel here the other day and it was so
awesome that we wanted to bring the
camera and show you guys and show our
kids and so we got up nice and early
this morning and we are out here we
thought the kids would enjoy the big
waves

cove where there is a lot smaller ways
or no ways and I think the kids are
really loving the big wave so yes you
can see they're mesmerized by the huge
wave that pretty cool code what do you
think of that amazing pretty where's
your crab that you guys are seeing oh

rock we'll see another one they're all
over the place I guess I'll just write

tons of the red orange Coral

kind of a gray one right there it might
be dead or maybe not and I'll put on the
edge right over here somewhere

look at this one this is my gosh
that one was huge I don't know if I want
to take the kids down in the cave or not
John okay so this is a far away view it
looks just like a flat area but there
are holes all through and you can see
when the tide comes in they get shoved
up into these holes in the ground
can see this is and there are certain
ones so we can get into
and that cool coast you got to say
exactly bias in this area
yeah the rocks will hurt ship you trip
and fall and if you fall into a hole
some of them I mean you really just
don't want to do that don't do it you
can see these are two other holes to
open up into the main main area see
