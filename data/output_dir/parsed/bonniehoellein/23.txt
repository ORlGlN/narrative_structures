well doggie doggy and binky can't be
here well you know what but yes they can
do you know why today is an awesome day
do you know why doggy and binky can be
here bud because while the cat's away
the mice will play
does anybody know what that means yes
when mom's gone we can party and I have
the best way to start our party day off
they taste like crispy is that yummy
look and drinking the carton for mom is
gone yes sir there are crispy in the
cream I believe in a few sayings in life
while the cat's away the mice will play
which means we're gonna party
I believe in asking for forgiveness is
so much easier than asking for
permission
well you guys want to get further than
the movie better ask mom first away
she's not here
completing transaction payments
successful you want to lay there with
doggy
go ahead but do your thing
mom's not here for chicken it is oh
you want one too all right mom's not
here - popcorn chickens it is get a
drink they wash that down with whoo that
was just a little sip
I haven't had like soda soda like this
for months now and that was like an
infusion of sugar yeah drink yeah
mom's gone drink all they want but five
dollar DVDs as long as the cat is away
the mice will play and I am doing
something that may get me in trouble a
lot but this is one of those things I
think it's better to ask forgiveness
than permission
I found an item that I've been looking
for for the three big kids it'll be for
the fourth eventually he'll grow into it
but I found an item online for a really
really good deal and I just don't want
to pass it up so I'm just not gonna ask
for permission I'm just gonna go get it
so me and the kids are getting out of
school early and we're going to pick up
this item right now to start our Friday
weekend off
the kids have no idea what we're doing
yet but I just have to say this Bonnie
and I don't spend a dime in this house
without letting each other know what
we're getting first and especially
nothing big this is probably the largest
expense and looking at two kids that one
of us has ever made without the other
one knowing and bonnie has no idea what
I'm about to purchase and I'm ecstatic
about it we're here to take this guy
home do you want to take that home can
you believe that you guys are not as
excited as I thought yeah this is your
father I can't drive on that yeah you
just got a four-wheeler I'm not kidding
I am buying it right now I think out of
all the kids he was the most excited for
the four-wheeler I think they're warming
up to it they were a little bit in shock
I think I may have prepared them for the
wrong thing maybe a little bit I don't
know get in there you wild animal okay
look let's find an apple juice come here
hey stop right there stop right there
okay well bonnie was gone so I figured
what the heck she can't get mad for
another day just the battery operated
one look away
no don't we graduated oh yeah we just
like where'd the Salt Lake
what I want to do is go for a ride I
know
think of me bet I know at bedtime but
mommy's not home so you could have one
last treat for today
that's a binky for bedtime don't show it
to mommy are you showing it to mom in
the camera don't show it to her she'll
see it

you guys weren't as excited yesterday
but I think you're ecstatic now huh hey
your hair don't look too bad your
hairstylist has been on vacation for a
week so that's a good forget when I'll
be coming home
then
be at your door
when I'll be coming home
I plan to let you know
warning of my heart
the wish I carry hi
whenever we're apart
it takes me through the night
another deep into your eyes

to do with me he just wants to see like
everything else I've been holding him
forever
yet again yes they did
let's go I turn the carousel do you
bring me anything right there doing a
dance
that seems like a really bad idea that's
not a right
this isn't Lagoon bud this is the
airport I'd literally had to pull him
off there he was climbing on it like
just going mirages when I'll be coming
huh
he is so mad he just wants to stay at
the airport and run you have so much fun
