previously on blood queens if there's
anything I do you know right now is that
the landlord lied to our faces
you're pretty at all but your brain
capacity is nearly brain dead you're not
any better take away your bat bleach job
and my clothes are wearing and your
pretty basic what do you mean is helping
them
Gabi and Ali are getting it all figured
out I know what you're thinking why me
right when I was younger I was new to
school I just moved from Puerto Rico
because my mom wanted to escape her
boyfriend
do you even go here yeah I do
hi my name is natural surfin actually do
you mean Ashley hello nationally never
heard of it sounds like your mom is
trying to name you Ashley but decides
neither knockoff named Ashley because
you're way too ugly to be a good one

behavior you're both going down
it's office to hear me
that this Academy renal treat our
classmates the way YouTube have been

Adam he must not be hot right now about
here I'm sorry I did order a burrito
burrito weird and talking about you
silly you're fools back and you're only
with
yeah of course maybe we can get burrito
Adam why is this always happen why do
they always like her the only way to
keep the hot guys away from her is if
you make her one of us that way every
guy that you think is hot is off-limits
to her and chicks before dicks trust me
if that girl's more desperate to be one
of us than to take the hot guys
good evening bitches
good evening Gabi I can you sit up
conquering the world was long after all
along my plan was not to only become the
leader but to have the girls fear me and
mainly forgot me to feel inferior and
scare of me like I was scared
Alastor comes from a family of money why
Alastair Reynolds is a reynold his
family runs the Reynold hotels his
family paid me for the murders to take
place that night because they wanted to
make sure the lux would didn't exist as
a hotel anymore my plan is to get back
at the lux would the lux would is
responsible for my mother's death
James Warner the landlord things that I
will decide but he has no idea that I
plan to kill him - tonight as far as my
revenge and as far as Alistair goes his
plan the other night wasn't him trying
to help the B Squad but it was to kill
them
he had no escape plan and he was helping
me out he wasn't trying to play his way
out rather he was paid to have the job
done which he failed to do and that was
to have the girls murdered in the
basement
except for Nash of the beasts are you
going to tell the B squad I'm working on
something and what are we going to do
about Alice Terrell's kill him
what now Miss Piggy
do you notice anything here Gaby yeah
sure once it's bigger than the other
Eddie is gone I'm okay
but your man is okay how do you think he
escaped the clown killer he could be the
killer
we're very unsafe here Ally I didn't
want to have to come down to this but
it's time I told you maybe Eddie didn't
like you very much maybe Eddie was
scared of how hideous you are maybe this
was all a plan for Eddie to get away
from you he loved me
I'm not dealing with these fictitious
accusations who day before I stood there
I thought they thought I was what do you
mean by love my family hates a little
video I was first did you think them was
he capable of doing him because of that
you change me
by the house you're really stupid where
have you been
we're getting out of here to bigger
better things
they gave mash the money she called
earlier putting it down payment on my
granny's estate mansion three girls be
living here and I'll be around the only
way we'll be able to commit to the
listing is if titles are built in
throughout the house along with a spare
bedroom in the basement
you

first season serum one either
