my name is Gabi and I'm the queen of V
Squad we all live in the Lux would turn
the lights on please
whoever killed Holly clearly wants to
kill us - you're all under lockdown
until the lux women figure out how to
mask what happened to Holly will you
help me my friends we don't want to die
oh my gosh I have you're grounded decaf
nonfat caramel soy that's it
add an extra shot and of extra teaspoon
of caramel 10 shots of vanilla it is
exactly 120 degrees the service is as
non-existent and at least I am they
would do not have service isn't justice
on existing as your patients
what do you mean is helping them do you
know is anything you daddy
yeah your wanted bigger than the other
hey guys now if you're really confused
with that you just watch
huh those of you who are subscribed
already know this and if you don't know
this I'm gonna explain so I've been a
huge fan of scream queens and I was very
upset to find out that they cancelled
season 3 so what did I do
I decided I was gonna make my own season
3 let me explain it better blood queens
is not scream queens
blood please is my own series it's a
scream queen spin-off slash parody it's
a different storyline different
characters it's the beat squad and not
the Chanel and the only thing similar to
it is the fact that we try to
incorporate the same humor and the same
fashion and we played with the comedy
horror genre just like scream queens
this series is gonna be playing every
Tuesday in October on my channel 50 love
the gap the last episode is gonna be
airing on Tuesday October 31st Halloween
one thing I do want to mention is that
this is a self-produced series meaning
it is no different than a video I would
make on the niki and gabi channel I know
a lot of people are expecting some huge
Hulu's slash YouTube red cameras no it's
a home produced show or my blog Channel
so if you're gonna come and heat about
the budget
please stop yourself because I did this
because I wanted to and I had so much
fun with it I wasn't trying to compete
with any YouTube red show I'm not trying
to make a fox show this is something fun
for my fantasy baby that gets something
for the scream queens fandom to watch if
you would like more information on blood
cleans please follow the instagram page
it's right here at blood cleans official
we post all the time we post neat peeks
we pose character reveals and everything
so make sure you go check that out also
one lot disclaimer I am so sorry
any
the lines in the script are offensive we
are simply spoofing the script of stream
Queens and if you haven't watched scream
queens the script is very gruesome
it's very messed up it's humorous but
yeah all in all my friends and I team
together this summer and put together
this amazing series for Halloween time
on this channel so please stay tuned and
I hope you're just as excited as I am
and I love you guys so much and I'm so
blessed that I get to have this platform
where I get to share all my fun little
projects and stay tuned for October 3rd
bye
