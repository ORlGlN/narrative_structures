so this is why we're running right now
long story short I drove separately from
Nicky and Alex because we wanted to take
two cars and they are a little behind
because they picked up a friend and
basically I'm parked in a really sketchy
weird area and they can't find me so
this is the first time I shared a
location with anyone and they are pretty
lost it's like a scavenger hunt
I shared my location and now they're
hunting me down in my car but I don't
think there's any luck it's been a while
Gabi drove here by herself and she
forgets how to share her location
I'm like we're trying to find her and
we're in like the city so it's like fun
it's fun trying to find guy oh we have
some languages urtis she shared it watch
it be like an hour push wait I don't
think she's they found me I'm the
missing treasure we thought that we
couldn't find you so it's like gonna
connect I'm the missing treasure
