once upon a Christmas Eve in the West
Wing of an estate set a very lonely
privileged girl her only friends were
the snowflakes
she has every dress in blush and white
every pastry cream and puff and a large
bath for herself
but all of these treasures just weren't
enough she goes by Gabriella and loves
Christmas very much but never a friend
to share it with to make cookies with
and such
she wished upon a snowflake and she does
so every year dear Santa please send me
a friend and please guide her footsteps
here
hopeless was she this stormy night and
how little did she know young Emmaline
alone in the cold without a co or home
she exited the window filled her sadness
with her grace
Gabby tiptoed to the bathroom to splash
some rose wash on her face she briefly
felt much bliss inside and delight upon
her skin she owns a face brush with
three heads the radiant spin care system
it truly gets the job done and it's
easier indeed clen leading hands that
are most usually dirty she'll use this
head for cleansing and this one to
exfoliate a Christmas gift from her to
you down below a link awaits
this usually is pricey but here's a
coupon code for you 75% off the code Gd
black will do with sugar on her lips a
brush upon her hair she wanted to feel
Christmas so she went to sleep
downstairs imperial at heart
it holds love she longs to give majestic
are her dreams that every girl should
live
a twinkle in the sky
stardust among the tree
knock-knock-knock
she heard three times what is this could
it be
with the candle in her hand dainty
slippers on her feet pointed to the toe
so the floor won't make a creep
her heartworm like Coco her so beaming
boat
come with me this holiday night come
inside you must be cold
they dance throughout the house to the
Nutcracker ballet they also just like
fairies garnished every inch of the fie
a light on their feet down the stairs
they snug down to the fridge giggling
and giddy were they as they tried every
tomorrow's dish they fancy it in every
gown some soap some tools some lace
they also made Christmas cookies with
icing on their face
they then dolled up their dues twine
their locks and darling curls much fun
did they have to make being princesses
being girls she's used this tool for
many years the Duval curling rods she
has a coupon code for you that too
is 75% off ringlets off like snow they
bounced so full of joy like a present
tied with the bow a great gift and a
great toy
the night was growing morn
both girls tired from their play they
need to get some rest now for tomorrow
is Christmas Day a wonderland of
blankets their curly heads close their
eyes
gabi peaked after M fell asleep
this was the best night of her life
she glanced across the festive room and
gazed so full of Glee Christmas isn't
about the things you have and it's not
underneath the tree
Christmas magic isn't wrapped in paper
nor is it garnished with a bow the gift
of friendship warm and true brings the
purest love and
the things we really want inside cannot
be bought or seen no gift or item will
ever replace what Gabriela felt this
