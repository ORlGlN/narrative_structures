see it's super funny people are
marketing right now the way people plan
weddings it's really funny to me
watching wedding planning i bustin a lot
of my wife's friends about this i truly
believe in my heart that most people put
way more time and effort and oomph into
planning their running than putting
energy into their actual marriage and I
truly believe that that is the analogy
of how people are treating their
business and marketing tactics I firmly
firmly believe that and I really think
about that every day I believe that
we're living through such an
unbelievable time
