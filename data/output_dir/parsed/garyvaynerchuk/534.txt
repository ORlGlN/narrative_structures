I kind of weirdly want people to pull
over right now I really you know if you
give if you get letters or calls that
people got into accidents that's on you
guys I'm leaving all my liability I want
you to pull over I want you to look at
that mirror rear view mirror right
that's let's go thank you I want you
look at it you need to understand if you
look at it it's your fault what if you
know everything in life is on you right
it's not your dad's fault who was a
drinker it's not your boyfriend that you
know cheated on you it's not your
girlfriend who's always putting you down
it is your fundamental fault
the second you make that decision then
you can go on the offense
