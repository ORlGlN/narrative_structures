what value in the world does it have to
look backward in a world where you're
going to make a ton more mistakes you

everything wired together if I didn't
make that mistake but would have that
led me to that meeting which became my
ultimate upside you can't unwind this
everybody wants to unwind ship to pack
them that's why I stay so macro got it
you
you
