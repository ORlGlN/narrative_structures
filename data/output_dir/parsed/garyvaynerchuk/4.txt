business, put out content.

VaynerMedia puts out content,
we both put out content.
Content, content, content, content.
The answer to every
question is more content.
More content.
There's too much bad content.
There's never too much good content.
Like content and you don't
know if you have good content
and you gotta let the market decide.
So the answer for right
while there's a land grab
is just more fuckin' content.
More content, more content because
99% of people are just not
putting out enough content.
So I'm not worried about the 1% that are.
So the answer is fuckin' more content.
