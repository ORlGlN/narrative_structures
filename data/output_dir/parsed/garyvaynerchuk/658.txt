how do you stay driven mom and ask you a
question how don't you stay driven well
let me get this right you won the lotto
of the universe which is you are a human
being on earth you I'm just gonna say
this I mean I don't think people think
about this you won the lotto you in the
universe you're not some weird specimen
in Mars that does nothing you're not you
know a bird you know you know you're not
a sunflower like you're a human being on
earth you won the ultimate ultimate
lottery and you're not driven and you're
not fired up and you're not going for it
and you're willing to sit like a lump
and just wait till you die you suck like
I don't know you suck
like I how do I stay driven because I
couldn't even comprehend the alternative
