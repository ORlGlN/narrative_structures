stop focusing on dumb and just keep
moving and don't be scared of breaking
anything and don't think about
perfection and there is no perfect way
to just cross your T's and dot your i's
and don't be crippled and don't be
romantic and just move and have no
seconds to breathe and just schedule on
schedule on schedule five minute
meetings ten minute meetings three
minute meetings eight minute meetings
and just move
