When impact is your
motivation you could be calm.
I like the people waitin' in
line tryin' to make that money.
You know what this reminds me of?
It's baseball card
shows, that's all it is.
It's just patience man.
Fuckin' hard ass work,
listening to absolutely nobody
and everybody wants to listen
to other people's opinions
it's all fuckin' mistakes.
You have one big thing they don't have.
If one fuckin' persons in there.

to get back on the horse?
- There's no fuckin' choice.
You've gotta do what
the fuck you wanna do.
99% of influencers go for
the cash, never waiver.
Almost everybody wants it faster.
Most of the people here
aren't where they're at
because they did actions
that were predicated
on lack of patience.
Hot Ones community, I love you.
Even the 7,000 of you
that said I am the worst
piece of shit, that's
why I replied to you,
because I got love for you.
Dude, can you throw that
phone on the ground?
Take a photo.

hungry to make it the next year.

Look at these guys.

It's a piece I call The Good Challenge.

I'm going to fuckin' die,
practicality, all that
shit, happenin' right now.
- Yes! If you're willing to bleed.
If you're willing to be humble.
Work!
Reboot your operating system,
it's in the dome not the phone.
You either have money or you have time.
Everybody's fancy and
doesn't want to fuckin' be
at a hundred people.
Is it 5:30? Second floor?
The Studio
5:30 The Complex Studio, it's goin' down.
The Q and A session, come see
me if you are at Complex Con.
All that WWF wrestling promotion
shit watchin' came through.
I'll tell you right now, there's
not one fuckin' group here
that had the right concept.
They just kept iterating what
they did, they did, they did.
- That guy right there is
a fuckin' genius everybody.
- Thank you brother. Thank you.
Big Crit, this guy's new
project, do not sleep on this.

to the fuckin' game,
to the national anthem.
Like, you've just started.
- I'm eatin' lunch with
the scalpers outside.
(laughter)
- I'm telling you, just pick one.
Just pick one, you're not
gonna know how it would've
worked out anyway.
Stop bullshitting and
start doin' somethin'.
I'll get you fuckin' mental fit,
because you've got one fuckin'
life, stop bullshittin' it.
I might be in Atlanta the
day after Thanksgiving.
You'll never regret
fuckin' making that punch.
So much progress for both of us.
Not even a year.
- You're unbelievable.
- Vlog, thank you Barney,
you're unbelievable
for seeing it for reaching out.
- What's your goal for 2018?
- I just want to be better
than I was the year before,
as a person, as an executor,
as an entrepreneur,
as a personality, as a dad, just better.
- Tell the people they're gonna die?
- Oh, I know they're gonna die,
it's what they're gonna do about it.
Do something.
You can't make up a narrative,
either you played Spades
and Cielo or you didn't.
Either you lived in the
environment we lived in
or you didn't.
It was like my Puff Daddy.
The mmms are comin' in.
I was about to sit down
because mmms are like,
oh shit, I better say
something else fuckin' fresh.
I haven't even talked about
mmms before I sit the fuck down.
I better come over a little more fresh.
Nobody is giving a fuck about
a supreme backpack when your
health isn't goin' anywhere.
Thank you guys so much, I
have nothin' but love for you.
(cheering)
Uh oh, look at this Vlog, double fisted.
Double fisted on the Vlog.
