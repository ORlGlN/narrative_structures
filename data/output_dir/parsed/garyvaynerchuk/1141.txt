ncg asks what does one do when you feel
you have unique content but not tapping
into the right audience or not gaining
visibility Nicola this is where you
start looking yourself in the mirror and
deciding if you have business
development chops this notion that you
have the greatest content and it's not
finding its audience is romantic at
worst and audacious at best right and so
like to me what you need to look at is
are you capable of also building
audience for your content or you just
the content provider and do you need a
partner who can go out and help you do
that or have you just lost all sense of
reality and your stuff is just average
oh crap wait subscribe to do I need
subscriptions because I can't push this
many right hooks in social so subscribe
