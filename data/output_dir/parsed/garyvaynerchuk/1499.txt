you're a multi-billion dollar company
how about this jerk-off why don't you
take three commercials don't do them
that nobody watches and let's hire nine
people to actually care about you our
end-user what a concept how are we gonna
do this
I don't know stop throwing cash down the
toilet how are you gonna do this maybe
you don't buy a Yellow Pages ad this
year guys you don't need it promise
you're better off gonna do smoke signals
at the top of the building it's 2011
