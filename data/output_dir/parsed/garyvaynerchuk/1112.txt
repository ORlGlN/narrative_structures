who wants to know if you bought the Jets
today what would be the first thing you
would do
Lou I've always said that the first
thing I would do once I buy these New
York Jets I'm pointing to the stadium by
the way is I would start a program that
would send the jersey to every
six-year-old boy and girl in the New
York New Jersey tri-state area with a
handwritten note from me saying thank
you or maybe just a note that I would
sign some because that's a big number
but I want to basically convert every
single youth into the green not the blue
and so that would be the number one
thing I would do start the program that
I've been imagining and dreaming about
my whole life
