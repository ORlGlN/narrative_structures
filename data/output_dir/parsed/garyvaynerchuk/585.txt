I gots frog ha ha ha
thank God I woke up today that's my
rules out that Lee had to mix it you
have to deal with the reality of the
situation
dwelling and pondering and crying
doesn't do and it especially
doesn't do in this eco chamber in
this arena there is no crying you can
cry you're just gonna lose and I'm bad
news about complaining and crying let me
tell you something about complaining and
crying that's really really gonna hurt
for all you complainers out there nobody
gives a it's here it's upon us and
now we have to more than ever we have to
start deploying self awareness if you
leave here and start your process of
really knowing what makes you happy if
you want to actually do something even
in the light of the picture that I'm
painting right now who are you scared to
fail in front of the reason so many of
you are not doing what you want to do is
you're scared you're scared that your
brother will judge you your wife your
girlfriend your husband and most scary
your mom or your dad you need to
eliminate that and/or own that fear and
put yourself in a position to succeed
and a lot of people need to hear one of
two things today which is this is the
greatest era to ever be alive and be an
entrepreneur executive if you want it
and
stop complaining and dwelling cuz nobody
gives a
thank you yes Oakland ah could you
imagine who there's good one oh we're
going to a whole different place yeah
Drive you over there go back and look at
what happened in the late 40s and early
50s when our society went away from
being a primary television society to an
emerging television society a lot of
people a lot of power a lot of brands
died and a lot of emerged and that's
what we're about to live through over
this next decade as we shift to the
phone being our primary news content
information platform we will have people
that are romantic and holding on to the
old world and they'll die and we'll have
new people that execute and storytelling
a new platform and emerge as more
important figures organizations and
causes because every time there's
something new we have an inability as
people to apply historic rules to it and
we're scared of the new thing we go into
defense again this is what we did on TV
forever and back to vine what
tell you about the 50 people that went
all-in on vine they're making millions
of dollars a year on branded content on
snapchat and Instagram they made a good
call while you debated if it was going
