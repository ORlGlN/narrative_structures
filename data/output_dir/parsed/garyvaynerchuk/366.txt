I'm going to give you the best piece of
ice I got you need to more than anything
think about two core things in my
opinion one you have to at all costs not
beat your own self up with yourself yes
at all cost fair enough it's yesh you
need to really be your own biggest fan
instead of critiquing everything number
2 momentsintime you've got to wrap your
head around how young you actually are
you have to wrap your head around how
early in the process this is and how
this is just a very small moment in time
yeah very quickly I can tell you you
need to get every voice out of your head
besides yourself and you need to love
yourself you will win can't live your
life based on other people's point of
view
