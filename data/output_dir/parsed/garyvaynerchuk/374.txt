if anything besides being practical and
start making money instead of losing
money is what you remember from this
talk this morning please make it that
you need to go to a senior citizen home
and volunteer for one day here's what I
want you to do spend one day at a senior
citizen home and I promise you you will
leave with the following you will leave
that the scariest thing in the world the
scariest thing in the world to human
beings is regret what you will see in
those 80 and 90 year olds some will be
happy and they'll be content but you
will see something at scale that scares
the living out of me
it's called regret the amount of people
that wish they did things is scary and
let me promise you something when you're
93 it's hard to pull it off
