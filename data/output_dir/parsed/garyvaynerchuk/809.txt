so for me it's just understanding what's
actually happening
I believe in patience because it's part
of the equation I believe in hard work
because it's part of the equation
I believe in knowing your because
it's part of the equation and and for me
I'm not worried about all the other
noise you know especially in a world
where people are going to always tell
you about your shortcomings like if
you're like your number one fan
you've lost because the market is really
good at tearing you down
you
