the problem is most businesses are not
playing the marathon they're playing the
Sprint right they're not worried about
lifetime value and retention they're
worried about short-term goals social is
not going to excite anybody in this room
for what it's going to do to your bottom
line in a six month or 12 month period
it just can't happen see social media
marketing is like going beyond say on
your customers you've got to put a
 ring on it
