TJ asks how would you suggest an indie
artists use their marketing money when
the royalty check comes in six months
later Jay first of all thank you for the
music today big ups to him and the
royalty check coming six months later
how do I think you should execute on
that is very simple I think you should
execute six months of patience if you
don't the money you just wait for it to
come and then you execute there is a
lack wordplay Jay and everybody else is
watching there is a lack of patience the
thought that your royal teach it comes
six months later means that whatever you
wanted to do with that money's you know
to attack just has to wait six months
and so practically I just wait
