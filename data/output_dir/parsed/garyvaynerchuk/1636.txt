everybody I'm playing with a little bit
of editing on garyvaynerchuk.com
so bear with me but here it goes you
know sometimes you know thinking about
new stuff to say and I want the quality
content to be good and not waste your
time and I wanted to come up with
something lightweight that helped me
kind of communicate my thoughts on a
daily basis cuz I want to be more Givi
calm which is not a URL Garriga calm and
so I'm going to start with something
called frown up frown down so this is
how it's basically gonna work coming
forward you're gonna see a very very
short video for me that's going to go
like this
and then you'll see something which you
just did and then you'll see me do this
and you see something like you just I
hope you enjoy
