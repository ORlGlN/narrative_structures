I'm very very predicated on running a
marathon in a world that I think is
running a sprint I think when we think
about 2014 and when I think about the
entrepreneurs in this room and marketers
are the brands that I work with we live
in a world where people lack patience we
just don't have patience and I promise
you that if you're able to whether it's
financially or emotionally put yourself
in a position to have patience you have
a far better chance of succeeding your
decision-making path becomes far clearer
and you build much more leverage to
actually build wealth or work-life
balance or legacy or whatever makes you
tick
