how old are you I'm 20 you got
time it's a it's a balance of regret and
patience look you can go hard on for
three years do nothing right wake up and
be young as you should really go to
a retirement home one day and volunteer
and just talk to them it will make you
wanna do every minute in your life
because when you see regret in a man's
eyes it's painful because you
have can't do about it when you're
90 and you're not mobile and you're
tired and it's over you can't do it you
can't do it you can't build that company
you wanted you can't spend that time
with your kid you it's regret and it
 drives the out of me times
are for me great I'm on my mom credit
Golf for me tears down a job for me
unless you know these demons draw for me
she's no evil no father
