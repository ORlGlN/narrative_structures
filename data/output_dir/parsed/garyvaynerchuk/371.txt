the key is to be happy with yourself
right like I have no interest in making
you happy about my work-life balance
you worry about your work-life balance
like my key is first me and this is in
order then my kids and my wife because
mom happy then I can do anything for
them and that's it right and that's what
I that's what matters and and if this
feels good
for now I've been great but I'm happy
for me and I want people to be happy for
them and and if that means 9 to 5 and if
that means 49,000 a year in income and
you're happy as hell well then you want
