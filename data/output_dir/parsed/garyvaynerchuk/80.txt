(piano music)
- What's interesting
about fear and excuses
is if you reverse-engineer them backward
to the seed of where it's coming from,
it means that a stunning
majority of the people
in this audience
are actually tied up
in caring about somebody
else's point of view on them
and I'm really fascinated by that.
Fear's holding you back,
you know what you wanna do.
The only reason you're doing it
is 'cause you're scared of doing
what you actually wanna do.
So what are you scared of, failing?
-  Not failing but
still being at the same
place when my friends are
at the next level.
- Huge mistake.
You don't want the same
thing your friends want.
So why (bleep) do you what they have?
Number one mistake so many people make
is they care about what other people have.
I don't (bleep) what anybody has.
If I have more, if i have
less, doesn't matter.
I worry about myself.
The fact that you're worrying about
other people's accomplishments
is already a losing formula.
You need to get rid of that first
then you could focus on yourself.
I would argue that well
more than 50% of the people
in this audience are here today
because they worry about
the way they would be judged
by one and or two family members
in their inner seven, eight people circle.
If you're not feeling
it, find new friends.
I'm being dead serious about this.
This one is real big for me.
Who you hang out with is a huge deal
and again, these are all
tried and true things, right?
We've heard the,
you're the whatever of the
five friends you spend like,
that's real.
Add one new winner friend.
Like you know what I mean?
Add one new winner friend
and cut one loser friend.
Like yeah I know he's been
your boy since fourth grade
but he sits at home and smokes
weed and plays 2K all day.
Like, you can only love 'em so much.
And to me, that is the
most fascinating thing
that's happening as I'm
going through my journey
which is, "Oh."
The reason I
am capable and have the
luxury of standing up here
is that my parents parented me in a way
that gave me so much
self-esteem while respect.
When I was nine years
old and opened the door
for an elderly woman at a McDonald's,
she reacted as if I won
the Nobel Peace Prize.
What my mom did was super smart.
She overreacted on
everything that I was doing
that was a good human trait.
My mom built huge self-esteem in me
and I feel like the biggest reason
I am who I am today to everybody
is 'cause I feel so guilty and so grateful
for what she did for me
that I wanna do it for everybody else.
Which is guess what?
You suck at a ton of (bleep)
Good, so does everybody else.
You're also probably pretty
(bleep) rad at something.
Try as many things as possible
until you figure out what
you're rad at and you like,
and go (bleep) do that
for the rest of your life
and stop giving a (bleep)
about everybody else.
There's this an incredible,
you know, like kind of
access point of like
what you're great at and what you love.
When you stumble into
being somebody like me,
you really win.
When what you're naturally great at
is what you naturally love the most
and away you go.
And so I think what you need
to do is taste everything.
It's kind of like food.
You don't know what
your favorite food is if
you only eat one food.
So I would take advantage of your youth
and your flexibility at this kind of age
and try to taste everything,
play with everything,
figure out what you might be good at,
what you might like and
then you make a decision.
It's a very fine balance.
I don't stand up here not giving a (bleep)
about what people think about me.
It's just that,
I care just a little more about
what I think about myself
than everybody else combined.
And I just think a lot
of people are crippled by
going on the offense
because we are sold defense.
We are sold defense.
We just are.
Offense is always the best defense.
Offense always solves problems
as long as your defense is
not a complete disaster.
So I just think offense
is a very good mentality.
There is a trigger mindset.
I'm always trying to stay on offense.
Same (bleep) I always say.
Same (bleep) I hear
from everybody who wins.
You know, I think the
fear of losing trumps
the excitement of victory
for so many people.
I think people are so scared.
Nobody wants the rejection.
Nobody wants to lose.
So, I understand the philosophy.
I understand that string of DNA
that doesn't wanna make you lose.
But I'm so desperate to figure out
how to convince people that
there is no loss in going for it.
That, yeah you might get made fun of
and you might have it in your own mind but
trying to figure out how to make people
drop that fear of going and building
a business for themselves in 2012.
Trying to figure out how to make a video
or a give a talk or send a tweet
or
write a book.
Just something that makes
people understand that
executing the way it always is
is gonna lead you to a place
where you're not going to win.
Life's funny bro.
And I think that a lot of people
are sitting here for
another reason in those two.
Fear, judgment of others.
This one I'm obsessed with
if you're following me
and I just think most
of you lack patience.
I tell these 23 year olds,
26 year olds all the time
to be patient because they should.
How old are you?
- 44.
- I'm 40.
Do you know how young we feel?
It's,
when you were 26, did you ever think
that this is what 44 felt like?
- No.
- You thought that that was finished.
- Yeah.
- Like, you think of 40 year olds,
when I was 25 years old,
I thought a 40 year old was finished.
I don't even feel like I'm starting.
It's a balance of regret and patience.
Like you can go hard on for three years,
do nothing right, wake
up and be young (bleep)
You should really go to
a retirement home one day
and volunteer and just talk to them.
It will make you wanna use
(bleep) every minute of your life
because when you see
regret in a man's eyes,
it's (bleep) painful
because you can't do (bleep) about it.
When you're 90 and you're not mobile
and you're tired and it's over,
you can't do any, you can't do it.
You can't build that company you wanted.
You can't spend that time with your kid.
It's regret.
And that (bleep) drives
the (bleep) out of me.
I think that patience
has been the disproportionate
component of my success.
- So what should we do, Gary Vee?
Let's wrap this up.
What should we do?
What should people do?
- People should stop complaining.
- Right, good call.
People should figure out
who the (bleep) they are.
- Good call.
- People should not listen
to America propaganda
of fixing the (bleep) they suck at.
They should be tripling down
at what they're good at.
They should be competent in certain areas
but you're not gonna become Beyonce
or you know, like your bone
structure is a certain way.
Like you're not gonna solve everything.
Your IQ can get a little bit better
but don't worry about the incremental.
Figure out what puts you on fire
and you're halfway decent at.
If you're lucky enough
right now to be listening
and you're good at what you like,
become tunnel (bleep) vision.
Because there's way too many voices
telling you what and how
and here's the other thing
and this is the big one, Joe.
Have the conversation
with the person that's holding you back.
The reason most people who
are listening right now
are not doing that thing,
is they're worried about
the opinion of somebody.
Usually, their mother.
Usually, their father.
And the reality is, is that your spouse
may be the person holding you back
and you have to have that conversation.
- Cut 'em off.
- We have to get to a place
where you're doing you
because the number one thing
that scares the (bleep)
out of me is regret.
And you're gonna sit there at 72
and you're gonna say,
I wish, I wish, I wish
and whether that's money
or spend more time with your family,
there's a million ways to do this.
Not everybody wants to buy the Jets.
Not everybody wants to smoke
weed on the beach in Bahamas.
Like, everybody's got a
different (bleep) thing.
Figure out what your (bleep) thing is
and stop making (bleep)
bull(bleep) excuses.
Who the president is, your mom did this,
like, like, I missed it,
I had that idea for Uber.
Then why didn't you (bleep) do it?
There's a reason that
guys and gals like me
continue to have audiences
because people wanna be
motivated to go and do things
or they wanna learn tactics
to go and do things.
But whether I'm giving you tactical advice
like filters on Snapchat or Facebook Ads
or Instagram story collaborations
or I'm motivating you through my words,
because I communicate that way,
or through my actions,
seeing this wake up at five.
If everybody who's watching this
actually did something about it,
and then went on the course
of their version of it,
then they wouldn't be watching this.
And I genuinely know at
the bottom of my heart,
out of all the people that
wanna build audiences,
that I'm the complete
opposite of almost all of them
because 99% of people that
produce content like this
that are out there like I am,
the business of being
that is what they are.
I have businesses.
I have Wine Library and VaynerMedia.
I don't need your 14 bucks for my book
or to be in my course or this and that.
So I don't need to monetize you.
So I then genuinely want you
to never watch me again.
The problem is every time
you guys are posting,
do you know how many times I see on my,
on my Instagram, oh I needed this today?
And you know how many
times I see that person
nine months later still hanging around?
If you needed it, then take
it and do something about it.
The reason there's gonna be
a billion motivational
views today on YouTube
is that people love the
feeling of being motivated,
they don't like putting in the work
to do something about the feeling.
I hate the motivation me
until you do something about it.
