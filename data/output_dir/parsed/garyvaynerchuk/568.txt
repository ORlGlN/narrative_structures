we're fancy it's not that you
can't it's that you're not willing to
give up dumb for a better life
you're not willing to go backwards
you're not willing to make yourself
dramatically happier to move out of your
home and downsize and go into a
different neighborhood you're not
willing to go backwards that to me is
fascinating the fact that things were
their home car watch clothes going out
is holding people back from a
substantially happier life is
fascinating to me and something that we
need to debate because at the end of the
day that one at-bat is all we've got and
so if I can absolutely push you one
tangible item I see some people have
pads and pens and I'm fascinated by that
go ready go to a F uck ing
retirement home spend time collect data
realize regret is the worst and do
something about it
