you were seeing the last scene of
eight-mile the mmm movie no look who saw
it great if you're into battle rap the
way I am there's a reason that you wake
is impossible to get into a beef with
drink is figured out the same thing I
figured out and the same thing that
Eminem figures out in eight mile which
is if you put your flaws to the
forefront you leave nothing for the
other person you've got so many more
strengths than your subtle little flaws
and to playing defense on those flaws
instead of going all offense on your
strengths that's the truth
