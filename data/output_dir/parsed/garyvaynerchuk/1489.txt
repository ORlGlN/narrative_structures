let's talk about community listen to
your users like fede said absolutely but
giving a about your users is way
better people listen but they don't do
anything
doing something answering those emails
giving a crap caring about your user
base that's what you need to do you need
to care about everything and it starts
with yourself look yourself in the
mirror and ask yourself what do I want
to do every day for the rest of my life
do that I promise you can monetize that
 if you love Alf do an Alf blog you
collect Smurfs slurp it up whatever you
need to do do it
