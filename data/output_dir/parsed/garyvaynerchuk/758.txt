promise me that you understand that the
land grab of happiness
starts right now because happiness
drives everywhere I've met hundreds of
people that have left their jobs making
good money when they had college debt
eighteen percent compounded interest
because they need their mental health to
be happy and they were willing to take a
step back and in the seven year period
they won when you're 51 or when you're
91 they're gonna be stunned how little
you care how little it mattered and this
includes your parents and your siblings
there's unbelievable happiness that
comes along with self belief and and
recognizing how this plays out
please take a step back and think about
how awesome it actually is
