that was up 5 to 30 love that was
actually look love 30 he was serving
against my Playa and I lost 75 two days
ago I was playing a DJ and cornhole up
30 nothing a game to 15 and in Game
three of a three-game series and he came
back in one these two comebacks and my
lack of concentration to finish people
off is something that's totally
unacceptable
and crushes my soul and competitive
spirit as an all-time high to never let
it happen again I'm very upset I'm sorry
to myself that's my family don't let
this happen to you always concentrate
and finish things off
