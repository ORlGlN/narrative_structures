Johnny asks if the Jets never come up
for sale in your lifetime and another
NFL team does would you buy that team
instead Johnny one of the things I
worried about what this show was
answering questions I don't like to
answer and this is one of them at this
point I've been flowed with this at this
point my belief is that I would really
focus on the mix and then after that a
random basketball team so it goes Jets
Knicks random basketball team that's
your answer
