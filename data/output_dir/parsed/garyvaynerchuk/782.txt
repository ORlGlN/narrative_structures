look my friends you can't run away from
who you are you can try to mold yourself
into a politically correct world and
luckily the world is now focusing on
other variables will always have race
and religion and sex in those things but
now we're leveling up even into like
what's a butter dad and like you know
what fit work-life balance to fix that
nature look I know the optics I know I'm
living a public persona I know I have to
answer these questions
I'd like to be politically correct that
I'd like to be perfect I'd like to make
it easy on myself to not have to be
oldest prescient the optics on the
outside here is the punched I promise
you can
