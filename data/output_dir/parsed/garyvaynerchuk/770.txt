it was romance that put everybody out of
business and the thing that bothers me
about romance is it lacks practicality I
hate when I go and speak at these
companies or agencies and they go
he's a disruptor and he's a real
disrupter areas Gary and I get up there
I'm like I'm not a disruptor I'm
the most practically guy in this
room you know what I think's disruptive
trying to sell a twenty five year old in
something threw a television
commercial that's disruptive that's
 insanity and you know what
bothers me the most and I'll end with
this you know this when you walk out of
this hole you know this it's
what you do every day as a
normal human
it's what your parents are doing every
day you see it right in your face but
because this is what you do for a living
you trick yourself when you walk through
these doors that's wrong justice justice
thank you
