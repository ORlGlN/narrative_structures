there is more content being produced
today in 48 hours than has been Proust
from the beginning of mankind until 2003
let's talk about that one more time from
the beginning of me icon you know the
guy took the club hit girls I mean
thought dinosaurs from the beginning of
time till 2003 that was like five
minutes ago there was this much content
produced now every 48 hours that much is
produced no wonder our kids have a Dede
poor guys what that means my friends is
one thing it is going to be difficult to
break through it's going to be difficult
to break through and it is my belief
that we're dawning an age where the only
thing that's going to break through is
quality intent actually caring about the
end user and you know why
cuz it's scalable for the first time
