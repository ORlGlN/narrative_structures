for an entrepreneur it's war out there
right and I never I hate any
entrepreneur that is like you know sad
like like you know what I mean like it's
it's always hard like it's always gonna
be hard it's hard when it's a bubble
because everything is $150,000 for a
$40,000 worker right it's hard when it
blows because there's no money and
nobody's buying and nobody's believing
it's always hard
