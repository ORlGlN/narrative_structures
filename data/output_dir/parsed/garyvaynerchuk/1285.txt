I think there's an obnoxious amount of
talented 15 to 20 year olds that are
completely unknown and I think what I
would do and what I've told some like
companies I buys for or people looking
you gotta look at places that dribble
and forests are an amazing you know
place to look for people like that
you've got to figure out where they're
hanging out like there's always a new
place where they're hanging out and most
of all similar to what I said earlier
you can't go I'm and like just start
selling right if you're not willing to
make the investment to be part of the
community you're never going to win that
game without paying the highest price
