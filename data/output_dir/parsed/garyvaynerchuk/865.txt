you know what I don't like complaining
if you know you've decided you want to
make money and you're gonna do for seven
years I don't want to hear any fucking
complaining about it every day like shut
your fucking mouth work for seven years
save us money and go fucking serve her
in the rest of your life so that's where
my mind sets on like go all-in on what
this like twenty people make a decision
and then cry about their decision every
fucking second you made a fucking
decision own it live it sleep in that
bed move on you don't like it change it
yeah
