you hear it all the time but sometimes
the reason you hear all the time is
cuz it's really true and the fact that
matter is just way too many people sweat
the little things these micro issues
cripple you you turn them into much
bigger issues than they actually are in
the scheme of things and and really one
of the things I spend most of my time
with with the people that I mentor in
management and even my friends and
family is to level up their thinking
take it and put it into perspective
don't let those little things drag you
down because if you do if you allow the
everyday little things to make an impact
you have no shot of winning the big game
non-0
you
