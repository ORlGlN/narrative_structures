time they're growing too fast what they
can't raise enough money just slow down
there Bernhard sure I mean you only have
two options either can pay your bills or
your camp either make one enough money
to pay your bills or you raise enough
money a lot of times startups grow but
because the markets and position is so
now they can't read the capital so
you've got to turn down your burn it's
if that's not the problem
and you're just sad because you can't be
as big as you need to be you just need
to deploy patient
it's very basic right this world gets
you thinking differently but if you take
a step back there's only two or three
things your situation requires so the u9

know how are you gonna comfort was great
hello I'm Gary how are you thank you
great hey Vlad this is the vlog pretty
gotta say I just wanted to say I thought
the atom is like one of the biggest Gary
Vee supporters he makes me like learn so
much stuff from him and I'm not joking
the first thing he said to me about that
I was like you need to go meet with him
and you sit cost her about social
strategy bola also I was like okay and
then he texted me your best and I was
like that's the same baller than me
another right after I saw Joey Dibble
today thanks for all the tips of the
advice and I'm so good all right let me
have gum - nice you know you have a
reputation for just like being
everywhere talking to everyone at
Southside like a good one Darden yes but
for last year they were like he's not
going to go to the green room
you're probably just going to see this
guy attacking all these people in his
session room and that's him and that's
exactly what happened so once again I
was like so you know with the carry
I have this one compassion what are you
talking about I'm doing full Q&A
shooting well Q&N be all inspirational
you know I tend to the inspiration I
really could Gary Boyd dailyvee you know
what I'm doing I'm doing a an Alexa
voice skill in the morning while you
brush your teeth to get a little bit you
know in that cool daily the day levy
that's it
dealer inspiration daily awesome thank
you mmm on this one yeah right here that
okay okay cool
oh sure hey guys hey thanks for being
here
oh gosh film it again complain this
morning curving yes how are you messed
with you
yes stupid wow what a minute you're so
handsome
how are you he rock I don't let the ever
that seems cool like that just gonna
thank people for coming in I'll be up in
a minute you stay on the offense of
positivity if you believe it you you
manage the amount of time you spend
looking and rubbernecking at negativity
I don't give a like like I see all
the negativity I just know that life is
like this like I expect like things to
be difficult like I want to find
everybody no matter where you spit on
politics and things I make sure just
data this is the greatest era to be
alive as sad as you are about certain
things I promise you it'd be worse right
now if the Black Plague was doing its
thing and so I think we get crippled
right you know I think a lot of people
here need to go and spend more time with
80 and 90 year old and ask them what
they lived through nothing's perfect
we're always going to have it bad it's
always going to be something we've
always picked on each other for being
different
it sucks so if you're lucky and you
don't have that in you I think you do
what I'm trying to do which is being
completely utterly on the offense of
positivity because if you're positive
and you're happy and you're optimistic
you owe it to each other right now to
get louder because the only people that
are allowed are the people that are
upset right negativity is on fire and
happy people are clamming up and staying
away from it that's how we stay happy I
want the other one going right at it
putting it out every single day that's
number one but we're all wired
differently I'm able to eat at
scale for the rest of my life that's why
I'm a leader so I'm a company that's why
I put myself out there if you get the
key you'll see it's about there it's
okay to not be there every day read
every comment like you don't bust
through on day one
if you do not love the process of what
you're up to
you've already lost it's true this
shit's hard like what do you want you
want your first podcast to be
number one on iTunes who the
 are you you know what I mean that's
the part you have to love it I love when
people on me I love it when I
showed up the tech world and like the
wine guy thinks he's going to win this
thing
yep you know then I love going to
Madison Avenue and being like this
Twitter business thinks that Twitter boy
tries to start an agency I said yes
I'm about to do this TV show right on on
Apple plan of the apps we code rights
planning apps has for celebrity mentors
climate Paltrow's will.i.am
jessica alba and others when I tell you
that article made me so happy you
got to love the process I think people
have to listen to it you don't have to
be massively entertaining or really know
what the you're talking about and
when you have both you know any but
there's plenty not massively charismatic
over-the-top fastens in what they do
because they know their craft
and they say it their way and by the way
maybe they are better off and that's
what's getting everybody understand you
have to find your medium maybe you're a
great writer
maybe a great in podcasting maybe you're
in video maybe you park tuned it up like
cue McLeod's dominates this scene of the
early days of South by like you've got
to find the way you communicate if you
want to communicate to the world don't
do podcasting just cuz it's trendy got
it good love it the loudest and best
relationships never win it just with
people that aren't winning think
if the people are the best that way so
the market through the course let's go
in detail like like TechCrunch doesn't
pick the winners right like that like
you know the Wall Street Journal doesn't
pick the winners three cool kids in the
crowd don't make the winners the problem
is everybody wants to be anointed a
winner or best at what they do before
they've actually done it let me just
remind you and everybody else here
I deal the business for 18 hours a day
every day running a wine liquor store
for 13 years every day before I ever had
the audacity to come to something like
this and talk so so let me have let me
tell you something amazing if you're
good enough you will win but if you were
upset that somebody else's grandpappy
got them ahead of you then you're going
to lose everybody started ahead of me
I'm just catching up and then how would
you hang on saying enticing
haha by recognizing you have no choice
do you understand I'm the most
ambitious and most patient person you've
ever met which is why I'm going to win
real real real big find your version of
that you know like that you have no
choice who's gonna cry for you like
what's the choice are you ambitious
awesome I don't think there's patience
yeah no and the problem right now
is that we're all living public lives
and all this horseshit this is what
entrepreneurship and success looks like
 going to Bali and
 swatches and private justice all
worship horseshit
but it's with people's minds and
they're getting impatient I don't give a
 what anybody else has I'm focused
on my stop focusing on your
there's young woman how old are you I
want to punch you in the face give your
whole life in front of you you know what
I mean
put your head down and do whatever this
thing that you want to prove that you're
the best at hardcore if you actually
spent all your time doing instead of
dwelling you do much further along
awesome I think with that I got to go I
love you guys I don't know if this wall
wired differently literally and I walked
funny I just don't I can't figure out
why I was spending time on
yes there's been many people who won on
slight variations of the same thing on
the third time just because you believe
in a thesis the way you executed within
it maybe you believe in ties and pies it
into youth but maybe made a pumpkin pie
and it supposed to be a strawberry I've
got it so it could still be the same
finish all right you have to make a
change you know sitting in your
tracklist and I can do anything right so
like you have to basically get P used to
go work at like 7-eleven like you have
to get the reset the are you to do
you know what I mean like that's your
quick when you're doing a clue that's
gonna work I think what you're doing is
better for most people than what I just
did
like for me help but for me selfishly I
want to improve and that's ready for
lunches
just the health of my family business
doesn't scare me this is what I do you
know I just don't and that people click
the social aspect the homeschooling is
the thing I think is fascinating like
the pros and cons the education not
debatable like the kids are being forced
literally I would have been a blessed of
them medicated if my teachers had their
way if I grew up in today's gay night I
stop I'm not stupid
by any means I didn't before fall time
student I don't think I'm feel like do
the thing it's like like you're not
interested probably I guess Kayla I feel
like icky doing better things that's
what I got my bed is that my mom would
have thought it off because we're old
school and Senator PN said it's weird
for us to even take tylenol but I
literally watch kids that are little
knees being completely stripped of their
magic find every conversation I get some
video we sure Ken Amy and Sridhar this
is going to be a very interesting video
what got you successful isn't
necessarily going to get him successful
everybody's got a different path called
his bluff if he's such a big shot and
he's so awesome
give him a mere to prove it to you and
if he doesn't drag his ass
Communiversity
know
rolling with my heart take it down
Hey
