stop focusing on dumb shit and just keep
moving and don't be scared of breaking
anything and don't think about
perfection and there is no perfect way
to cross your T's and dot your i's and
don't be crippled and don't be romantic
and just move and have no seconds to
breathe and just schedule on schedule on
schedule 5 minute meetings 10 minute
meetings 3 minute meetings 8 min of
meetings and just move
