the social media marketing is like going
Beyonce on your customers you've got to
put a fucking ring on it meanwhile 99%
of the people here and I looked at some
Twitter and Facebook accounts and some
of the peeps in this room 90% of you
more but I'm trying to be nice are
treating social media like a one-night
stand most companies are failing and
social because everybody in social is
acting like a 19 year old dude they're
trying to close on the first transaction
it's going right
