in game I finished winning that Madden
game I run into this forum room and I
hear the following thing my friend is
sitting in front of this thing and he
clicks some buttons and I hear her couch
remember that remember paying 13
 dollars a minute to be on the
Internet AOL anyway that's
another story
so I hear this thing right if we were
getting do you guys remember that bill I
mean there's some youngsters in this
crowd you guys don't remember we were
getting killed out there
my friend signs in he goes into this
chat room he types an 8 / s / L another
classic and he looks at me because he's
sitting and I'm up here I'll never
forget this look for the rest of my life
he looks at me and he goes we can get
chicks on this thing
and as long as I let the pause just
happen now while you were laughing cuz
that made me feel really good by the way
thank you was about as long as I paused
before my brain said I can sell on
this thing and that was it my life
changed again right there and there I
waited like seven hours after every
person sat
