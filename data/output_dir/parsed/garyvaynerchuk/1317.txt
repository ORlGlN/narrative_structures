get experience not enough kids are
willing to work for free or very little
to learn getting your hands dirty under
your fingernails
it's the game I just don't know what
else to say to me that is the number one
thing that blows my mind that kids don't
want to work for it so one learn your
craft to pay attention to your friends
the young are the future and if you
notice trends like oh they don't use
email you can learn from that or endure
watching a lot of YouTube so the two
biggest things are stop being soft and
start actually working and getting your
hands dirty in the thing that you love
and number two pay attention to trends
around your friends
