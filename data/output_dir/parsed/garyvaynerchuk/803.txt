I look at losing as a positive mainly
because everybody here doesn't like
losing cuz they're worried what other
people think about their loss program I
don't give a fuck about what other
people think about my L it's my l you go
worry about yourself I got this my L I'm
not worried about my wife thinks about
my L not worried about my kids think
about my L I don't give a fuck about my
parents took about my L I don't give a
fuck what you think about my L it's my L
and the reason people don't like losses
is not so much today no like losses
they're worried about what everybody
else thinks about their loss that's the
fucking year
