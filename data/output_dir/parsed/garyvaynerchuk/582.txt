this is shareable strange terrible
level of canine happenes Petry advance
is enormous
no the Jessup the one great thing for me
on this and I think we all need it
his escapism self what the Jets do for
me is allow me not to care about
anything
during those three or four hours I'm
just sewing into the Jets and if the
internet and alcohol became illegal in
America I wouldn't care I deal with it
afterwards I think all of us need to
find our escapism and we need to balance
how much escapism we need based on our
ambition that's how we do it that's why
I love it Oh what up bird oh we're here
