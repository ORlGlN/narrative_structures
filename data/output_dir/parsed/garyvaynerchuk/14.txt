- If I was 6'4" and ran like a gazelle
I'd play for the Jets
instead of owning them.
(laughing)
I really need everybody
to have that one sink in.
'Cause it's the most important one.
(soft, calm music)
You know like, when you're
driving and the cop-lights go on
and your fuckin' heart goes,
but then when the cop
drives by you're like, oof,
you feel real good and then you
start driving with two hands
and the speed limit for about four minutes
(laughing)
and then you go back to
being, like, ridiculous?
That's how people are living their lives.
Right?
Like, Grandma gets sick
or Mom has a cancer scare
or they get sick or something.
And then they get to start
caring about real shit.
Nobody's giving a fuck
about a supreme backpack
when your health isn't going anywhere.
(bells chiming)
And so, I just don't
understand why people are
living their lives like that.
And so, fucking gratitude.
We've got the whole game
misframed, everybody's confused.
People talk about millions as like,
I've gotta make a million
as like an entry-point,
and they don't even understand
that 99% of people in America
don't make $400,000 a year.
Nobody
is putting on marathon-sneakers,
everybody wants to be a sprinter,
everybody wants it tomorrow.
A lot of people taking money
and instead of investing it
back into their business,
buying dumb shit.
And that's why I fuckin'
put scrutiny on everybody
who's trying to do courses
and pre-rolls trying to get you
to pay $4,000 for this
and $10,000 for that.
This shit is simple.
All the information is free.
There's a lot of people who'd
much rather pay somebody
to make them feel good
about why they're not doing.
Let me give you the secret
once and for all right here:
Work
A lot.
Everybody looks at the people that made it
and none of you looked
at how they got there.
Talk your truth.
Create a framework that
you can fuckin' follow.
Talk your reality.
Think about your fucking grandparents
they didn't have no internet.
They had to work the job and go to sleep.
The fact that you can
work your nine to five
to pay off your debt or pay your rent
or take care of what you have to
and then you can take on your phone
and fuckin' work from 7:00
pm till two in the morning
that's a fuckin' blessing.
That's a fuckin' opportunity
and nobody can stop you
and nobody decides but us
it's fucking crazy.
Do you have the humility
to put in the fuckin' work?
Period.
Because the only people
listening to your excuses
or your bullshit are your
loser fuckin' friends.
My friends, let's just
get to the punchline,
nobody gives a fuck about your problems.
People sit in little
circles of four people,
everybody gassing each
other up to not do shit.
People complaining downstairs
wearing $213 shoes,
shut the fuck up.
(fast paced, rhythmic music)
Get perspective.
What the fuck do you think
is going on in the world?
Everybody's pointing at everybody
else without understanding
nobody's deploying empathy.
Here's what you don't get:
you fucking lack patience.
Too many of you talk about being
it but you're not living it
You know why you guys aren't patient?
'Cause you wanna win
already to fuckin' stick it
to your fuckin' parents.
I'm trying to become
your excuse, your shield,
your thing that you can point to
because if you trip and fall
you guys are worried about failing
and I'm trying to get you to point at me
and blame me that it didn't work
versus blaming yourself so
that it gives you the courage
to actually start doing shit.
But, you've gotta understand,
instead of sitting here and
dwelling and blaming them
you're in control of your own shit.
You got one fuck in that bat
do something with it.
Listen, some of you been
consuming this for a year or two
you watch those videos
on Instagram or YouTube
you watch my Blog or this
and that, listen to podcasts,
you get hyped,
and you're like, right, and
then you stop listening,
and you walk out into your real life,
and you go back to dumb shit.
You know how many people
sitting here still dwelling
about some dumb shit
that happened in 2011?
It's binary.
This whole thing.
Your fuckin' life is binary.
Let me tell you what you should focus on:
You need to do some shit you like.
If I could ever convince all
of you that your short-comings
and your detriments are your
strengths, you would win.
You guys wanna be selfless
and be good and give back?
Be selfish first and get your shit
to the place where you need to be.
The current state of political correctness
and how you should parent,
and how you should live,
and what age you should
get married at, like,
that's all bullshit.
(uplifting orchestral music)
There's only one story like yours.
I'm not scared of losing
'cause I don't allow
any of you to judge me.
Guys, you're only scared to
lose because you're worried
about what other people are gonna say.
My losses are my losses.
(peaceful, slow music)
