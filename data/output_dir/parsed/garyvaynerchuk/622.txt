(audience applause
and cheers)
- Thanks for having me.
So I'm super excited for the Q&A
part and I'm gonna try to rush
into that as
quickly as possible.
But I'll give you a little bit
of my spiel, what's on my mind
right now and then hopefully
we can go into that Q&A.
I think the first thing I want
to talk about is the fact that
I think we're living through one
of the biggest culture
shifts of our time.
I mean look, 30% of this
audience right now is using a
cell phone to record this
conversation and are looking at
this talk through their device.
Which I'm all for,
don't put it away.
I actually think
that's exactly right.
And I think that one of the
great misnomers, for example,
so many of you are
doing online business.
You get taught or
you get talking
about how do you monetize
from your website.
This, that and the other thing
and the next 24 to 36 months
most people are gonna consume
the entire internet
through a mobile device.
Yet, most of your websites are
completely optimized for
desktop computers and laptops.
Right?
This is the thing that
I spent all my time on.
What is really happening with
consumer behavior that most
people aren't
fully adjusting to?
Where is arbitrage?
The only thing I do for living
and why I have the audacity to
think that I can buy a
multibillion-dollar sports team
is that all my success has come
from a very simple move which is
day trading attention.
My asset, the thing that I most
care about, really you know,
if you sit in this room and
don't understand the importance
of this asset,
you'll become vulnerable
and not have as much upside.
The entire game is
predicated on attention.
Before you can tell me how great
your listing is that you're
selling or how great your
product is or how you how
amazing your nine week course
is, before you tell me how great
your shit is you've gotta
actually get my attention.
And in 2016 the supply and
demand of attention has become
extremely difficult
because we're getting thrown
at us so many things.
We are now living in a world
where information is being
pounded in our face 24/7/365
and the things that are gonna
break through are gonna actually
understand not only that you
have to produce great content
but way more importantly that
you have to understand the
context of the place where that
person is consuming the content.
If you're a real practitioner in
marketing you understand there's
a substantial difference between
a video that plays on Facebook,
that plays on YouTube
and that plays on Snapchat.
These are
fundamentally different things.
My mindset is different.
A 42-year-old female in the
United States that goes on
Pinterest and then 20 minutes
later goes on Facebook is the
same woman, with the same
income, with the same scenarios
but her mindset is different
when she's on Pinterest 'cause
she's got aspiration to buy
things versus when she's on
Facebook because she's keeping
up with her world yet every day
marketers in this room and
companies all over the world put
the same picture and
video in her feed thinking
it's gonna act the same way.
My friends, we are living
through the single biggest
culture shift, single biggest
culture shift of end consumer
attention since the
transition from the
radio to the television.
It's happening
right in front of you.
Right this second and yet so
many people in this room live
their lives one way but
they market a completely
different way, right?
One of the things that bothers
me the most especially the
homework, you know, these 21
hour traveling days allow you to
catch up on a lot of work and on
the way here I paid attention to
a lot of the people in this
room that have been tweeting or
Facebooking or emailing me
that they were gonna be here.
I took advantage and was able to
three or four hours of research
to really pay attention to what
some of you guys
are doing in this room.
And to be very honest with you
and I apologize I didn't want to
come to Sydney to razz but to
be very honest with you the far
majority of people in this room
that are marketing our marketing
in their best interest and
not in their consumer's
best interest.
The lack of patience, the lack
of
content that has anything to do
with other than what you want
them to do is quite stunning and
would be a very quick indicator
to me that the return on the
investment is not as great as
you'd like it to be because you
default into caring
about yourself first.
A lot of you consume my stuff,
you've heard my spiel,
I'm a big believer
that the people that
win deploy more value
than ask for in return.
When you're deploying as
I like to say 51% of
the value, you win.
As a lot you know, I don't
play the game of masterminds or
e-books or courses because I'm
very comfortable putting out my
content for free and then once
every three years
selling an $18 book.
I'm very comfortable
in that environment.
It's also the reason that
I think I'm able to build
$100 million businesses
that don't require me.
And really I'd like to pound
that thesis down this
collective room.
I think the one thing that I've
noticed has become very clear to
me that is a vulnerability and
it runs true across a lot of
demos is lack of patience.
If you really asked me what's
the telltale sign of somebody
who's really winning or is
capable of winning versus not
it's completely
predicated on patience.
You know, way too many
people aren't recognizing,
how 'bout this?
How many people in this room are
retiring in the next 10 years?
And I don't mean
you're gonna crush it.
I mean you're fucking
old and you're finished.
(audience laughter)
How many people in this room
are retiring in next 10 years?
Raise your hand.
Raise it high, don't be scared.
So for the six of you, four of
you, you could take a lot of
what I'm about to say
with a grain of salt. Right?
But for the majority of you,
I just want to remind all of you
that only 11 years ago
YouTube, Facebook,
smart phones, Twitter,
Snapchat,
Instagram it didn't exist.
Nothing existed 10 years ago
that is now at the
forefront of attention.
I grew up, actually how many
people here don't really know
my spiel? Raise your hand.
Just curious.
Good amount.
Great, perfect, I'll
go backwards then.
I grew up poor.
I was born in the Soviet Union.
I came to US when I was three.
My dad got a job at a liquor
store and eventually saved a lot
of money over a
seven year period.
Great shirt.
And, and, oh and you too.
(audience laughter)
And eventually owned a small
liquor store in New Jersey.
I grew up an entrepreneur.
Very hustler kid,
baseball cards,
lemonades stands,
things like that.
I got to my dad's
business at 14 and
at 17 I fell in love
with wine collecting.
I realized that people collected
wine the way I collected
baseball cards and memorabilia
and that became my passion point
to wanting to get
involved in my family business.
In 1996, I launched the second
ever e-commerce wine business in
America and from 1998 to 2005,
in a seven year window,
I built my dad's business
from a three to
a $65 million a year business.
So, my first business was
retail bricks and mortar
and e-commerce.
Not information, not
masterminds, not books,
not being me
just being an operator.
I didn't start talking about
business to the public
until I was 34 years old.
I built my foundation in
building a tangible
actual business.
That's what I come from,
that's who I am.
I'm currently the CEO of a
650 person digital
and social agency.
Kind of Madison Avenue
madmen 2016 business.
I grown that business from a
three to $100 million business
in the last five years.
I'm in the business of building
businesses, I just happen to
quite enjoy putting out
information that has an impact
on people along the way because
very honestly and this is quite
simple, I'm selfish off the high
that I get when I get an email
from somebody that has had
something good happen to them
based on my business advice.
That's where I'm at.
That's my life.
I don't--
(audience applause)
- Thank you.
I'm gonna make a lot more
money on my Uber stock and on my
Facebook stock than I'll ever
make being me or selling a book
or getting paid to speak.
What I like is being
historically correct.
What I like is knowing that
I was gifted with a way to
communicate that actually
gets through to people.
For example, 90% of the people
in this room are not willing to
work as hard
as their ambition. Right?
Let's just cut to the chase.
Do you know how many of
you are full of straight shit?
(audience laughter)
Let's cut right to the chase.
You talk a big game of what you
want but you're not
interested doing--
How many people in this room
watch DailyVee, my video blog?
Raise your hand.
So what this group knows versus
the half of the room, or third
of the room that raised their
hands that don't know me is that
I work 18 hours a day.
18.
That's what I do because I talk
a big game and I want big things
to happen and so you actually
have to put in the work.
Somebody in this room sent me a
Snapchat message couple hours
ago and said, "Gary, talk
to me about passive income."
Let me talk to all of
you about, passive income.
(audience laughter)
It doesn't fucking exist.
(audience laughter
and applause)
There's no fucking algorithm
that's gonna let you sit on the
fucking coast and drink
fucking champagne while
the money comes rolling in.
(audience laughter)
It doesn't exist and if
it does you're either doing
something illegal or something
that would make your spouse be
embarrassed of who you are.
I've been to enough bullshit
marketing conferences where
I've literally watched the
spouse of the person on stage
not feel comfortable telling
people how their husband
or wife makes money.
I have no interest in having a
legacy that I can't be proud of.
I also have no interest in
telling you how to make your
money or how you live your life.
I have no audacity or ability
even begin to think about that
but what I will tell
you is this, my friends.
In a 2016 world, right, in a
2016 world everybody in this
room is the patriarch and
matriarch of their family and
I would tell you that I live
under a very aggressive thesis
of how you make your money is
more important than how much you
make and I feel as though one of
the big messages that needs to
start being talked about is some
of the emotional intelligence
aspects of running a business.
I can stand here very
comfortably and tell a lot of
you that I'm not super
IQ'd out. I'm just not.
I'm not super smart when it
comes to just information
retention of shit
that's happened.
I've read seven books,
I've written four, right?
(audience laughter)
I'm not that smart.
I'm really not but what I can
tell you is on the flip side
when it comes to the
emotional intelligence, empathy,
self-awareness, gratitude,
intuition, I'm all-time.
As a matter of fact, in my will
right now, in my active will,
it says if humans ever figure
out how to measure emotional
intelligence, I want to
be dug up and tested.
(audience laughter)
Because I can't explain to you
how I know that every person in
this room is going
to be on Snapchat
or that every person is
going to eventually--
I know the fact that everybody
in this room 20 years from now
is to be sitting in their home
or whatever we're doing in
20 years and living through
virtual reality and that they'll
be struggling to understand
if this is real life
or if virtual reality
is real life.
I also know that 80% of his room
just heard me say that sentence
and said, "Get the
fuck outta here."
(audience laughter)
In the same way that I stood
in a room like this in 1996 and
said people were gonna buy wine
on the internet and everybody in
this room laughed at me.
Because the guy that
was sitting with me on stage
worked for the Yellow Pages.
I don't know if they have that
down here but the Yellow Pages
and made fun of me and said who
here, we were bantering and he
goes actually goes, "Who here
will buy wine on the internet?"
Nobody raised, could you
imagine being here right now and
watching this entire room,
nobody raises their hand.
(audience laughter)
I looked at him and I said,
"Honestly," and this was a
different world, I said, "I wish
this was being recorded because
"I will be
historically correct and
"all of you will be
historically wrong."
And so, I do that not
because I'm smart,
not because I know,
it's intuitive.
I can feel it.
I watch it.
I see little things
and I just feel it and
so here's what I can feel.
I want to make my money in a way
that makes me proud because
I don't want to have the
conversations with my
grandchildren about
how I made my money.
Everybody here needs to
understand everything you're
doing is being documented.
All of it.
Like every landing page you
create to convert someone,
everything is being documented
for ever and I'm watching so
many of my contemporaries and
friends chase money over their
good name, over the
way they're feel and
I'm very concerned about it.
I also know that everything
that you know today is
being disrupted heavily.
I know that the hotel industry,
this lovely hotel, the hotel
I'm staying in, I know that
five years ago none of them sat
there and said, okay what's your
biggest threat in five years?
They were worried
about each other.
Nobody's raised their hand at
the Four Season Hotel senior
staff meeting five years ago and
said what if somebody creates
like an eBay for people selling
each other their
rooms in their homes?
Nobody saw airBnB
coming in that industry.
The guy or gal that owned the
most taxi medallions in New York
City he or she didn't sit around
five years ago and said,
"You know, somebody might create
an app on the iPhone where
"people are gonna hit a button
and a limo is gonna come in
"two minutes and pick them up."
We are living, email,
I literally thought email was
the most indestructible core
communication funnel
in our society.
How many people in this room,
by show of hands, are familiar
with Slack or using Slack?
What's Slack?
Google that shit.
(audience laughter)
We don't have time
for that right now.
(audience laughter)
One more time, how
many people know Slack?
I don't predict Slack, I just
look at Slack and go holy fuck.
Gchat and email in my
organization has collapsed by
80% since we've installed Slack.
So, then I text Stuart
Butterfield, CEO, and I'm like,
"Can I invest?"
That's what I do for living.
We are living through a much
bigger culture shift than this
room it is respecting and
so what I want to
do is a couple things.
Number one, and Caleb it's fun
to have you here because I use
it as a proxy, I watched
Caleb from afar and I'm like you
better fucking talk about
14-year-old things not like he's
40 years old because
he's fucking 14, right?
And he's got a ton to add.
Especially, like what's actually
happening in 14 to 20-year-old
land but I don't think a
47-year-old in this room is
gonna respect a 14-year-old tell
him how to live
life when he's 14.
You need to stay in your lane.
Too many people want to be
something before they are.
You got plenty of time for that.
The bottom line is you need
is, if you're so advice,
please fucking know what
you're talking about.
(audience laughter)
And please as an audience we
need to start understanding like
there needs to be,
listen, everything can fly.
Everything can fly.
You can do anything you want but
I'd like to start employing
some common sense.
Wouldn't it make sense to take
business advice from somebody
that's actually built a business
versus the only business they've
ever had was to
give business advice.
Doesn't that fuckin'
make sense to you guys?
(audience laughter)
(audience applause)
I don't know.
Like, it fucking makes sense.
Attention arbitrage, I built
my brand on email, YouTube and
Twitter in 2006 or '07.
Back to the story.
I built a big business.
How did I build it?
How many people your done
email marketing in their lives?
Raise your hand.
Awesome.
In 1997, I had an email
newsletter for my wine business
200,000 people that had a 91%
open rate and 65% click through.
I'm no hero though.
It was because it was early.
Marketers hadn't
ruined email yet. Right?
We didn't ruin it yet.
I tried and I do and I'm trying
to ruin Snapchat right now.
That's what I do.
Show me with there's
attention, and I'm a salesman.
I want you to buy shit.
So I'm trying to figure out
how to sell you stuff on it.
That's what I did with
email while everybody
else had catalogs.
Then something came out,
it was called Google. Right?
I was intrigued by it 'cause
they this ad product
called AdWords.
The day it came out I owned the
word "wine" on Google
for five cents a click.
And I owned it for 9 1/2 months
before anybody bid me up because
people still didn't
know what it was.
How many people here are
actively creating content
for their business?
And by the way, if you raise
your hand I will jump out here
pick you and if you're
not actually doing it,
I'm gonna ruin
your personal brand.
(audience laughter)
So ready?
How many people in this room are
actually producing content right
now for their
business on Snapchat?
Raise your hand.
Seven.
Meanwhile, it is the fastest
growing attention
graph in the world.
Now, to your credit it is
absolutely a 13 to 25-year-old
thing which may not work for a
lot of you but here's the key.
It's like running a marathon.
If you're gonna run a marathon,
it's probably good
to run a 5K first.
If you're gonna run a marathon,
it's probably good to train on
the treadmill before
you do it. Right?
So the reason so many more hands
in this room should've went up
for Snapchat was in 24 months,
much like Facebook, the far
majority of 30 to 50-year-olds,
actually I'm gonna go with 25 to
45, 25 to 42 will be on it and
it will have more attention on
it then a lot of
things you've done.
That same newsletter on my email
service now has a 36% open rate.
It's bigger, I'm much better
at it, it's things I've learned
yet it can't be as good because
the supply and demand of
attention everybody has
an email newsletter now.
I amassed a million followers on
Twitter because
I attacked it in 2007.
I rode it and now it's declining
and I'm not emotional about it.
I'm getting far less engagement,
far less reach, far less
business results for my Twitter
account than
I did 36 months ago.
Do I cry that it's over?
No, I do not.
The level of crying when
something's over is disgusting.
(audience laughter)
I'm sorry that your conversion
from your affiliate marketing or
your JV email newsletters
doesn't work as well.
Get the fuck over it.
The market changes.
Nobody cares
about your feelings.
The market doesn't care.
The market doesn't care.
You care, I care but the market
doesn't and unfortunately for
everybody in this room,
the market is what matters.
And so what happens is what
I see from far is people,
you know, I always tell my
buddies the quickest way to go
out of business is to be
romantic about how
you make your money.
The quickest way to go out of
business is being romantic about
how you make your money.
A lot of you in this room,
historically, have
found an arbitrage.
Something worked. Right?
Whether it was email or Google
AdWords or affiliate marketing
or banner retargeting or JV'ing
or whatever the hell it was.
Videos on YouTube.
Whatever it was, right?
Joint venture,
yeah, she got you.
I see you.
Your homie's got you.
(audience laughter)
Whatever it is,
you've found it, right?
Right now, I think one of the
great arbitrages is
Instagram influencers. Right?
I think one of the most
underpriced things to do right
now is to go to Instagram
accounts that have a lot of
followers, see them, hopefully
they have their Gmail account in
the in their profile which many
of them do 'cause
they want the money.
You email them and you ask
them the price to do a sponsored
post, natively and integrate
it and it works extremely well.
It is by far the execution
that I most excited about for my
current book and is doing
extremely well because that's
where the attention is and those
prices will go up as people, as
they get 15 emails a day instead
of one, the price goes up.
It's just these levers.
I'm desperate to pound this
down everybody's throat because
what's gonna happen over next 10
years is we're gonna have 4 to 7
to 11 shifts in the marketplace.
Over the next decade,
you will have 4 to 7
to 11 shifts in the marketplace.
If you are doing email marketing
everything was fine until Google
and Gmail decided to
create a promotions tab.
That wasn't good.
And everything was great for the
Twitter influencers like me in
2010, '11, and '12 when
everybody's attention was there.
But then it was gone.
It's no different than
a hit television show.
When there's a hit television
show, the big brands in the
world want to run ads and
commercials during that show.
Eventually that show is not
popular anymore and
those ads aren't as good.
This dynamic is playing
through every single
day in this marketplace.
The problem is in,
at this level,
is people are holding on
and they're not educating
themselves on what's
happening next.
They're making
emotional decisions.
I love when people tell me this.
People are like, "Gary, but
you have to understand,
"I didn't grow
up with this stuff."
(single man laughing)
And I'm like, you like that?
(audience laughter)
That was a great
laugh, thank you.
I'm like, "That's right, Ron.
"But you didn't grow up driving
and you figured that out."
Right?
There's way too much emotion at
the 30, 40 and 50-year-old level
that they didn't
grow up in this.
I've got news alert.
I didn't grow up with it either.
At the time that
I was 18 years old,
I had spent 20 minutes
on a computer my life.
I didn't grow up with it.
I just figured it out.
I love how people don't
realize that putting in work
and learning is one of the
requisites for
building a business.
Like literally
when I'm like,
"Hey, you need to
learn Instagram."
"Really?"
(audience laughter)
What the fuck's
the matter with you?
Yes, really.
(audience laughter)
Like, yes, really yes
You have to learn.
It's a weird thing.
You have to know what the fuck
is going on in the world, yes.
And so, look here's
what I see happening;
the market's moving
faster than ever.
These generations of attention
are not lasting as long.
Facebook, the reason
they created an algorithm,
where all of you
got mad that you can't
reach everybody,
it was to save the
platform because if everybody
saw everything from everybody
we'd all be gone from
Facebook a long time ago.
The reason they
created an algorithm
is now people are still on it.
As a matter of fact, people are
spending more time on Facebook
today than 36 months ago because
their tweaking
the algorithm so well.
It's so interesting to
watch this play out.
A lot of other
platforms haven't.
Whether Facebook or Instagram or
Snapchat are here in 36 months
from now or not, I don't know.
Truth is I don't care.
What I know is that I'm going
to consistently pay attention
to what's emerging.
If you are not following this
narrative and if you do not
understand in this narrative
that one of the most important
things to do is to create
quality content and you've heard
this clichéd bullshit
marketing talk your whole life.
The problem is it's true.
The problem with the cliché
thing like you have to produce
content that's
valuable to sell shit,
the problem with
it is it's true.
It's true.
You have to provide value and
more importantly you're only as
good as your last at-bat.
You're only as good as
your last piece of content.
You're only as good as that.
These logos, these logos,
you have to understand
what's happening.
This.
I think we can all agree that
this becoming a very important
thing in our lives, right?
Thank you.
It's my hotel key.
(audience laughter)
This is a very important
thing in our lives, right?
And I think this is quickly
becoming the television
and the television is
becoming the radio.
Now this is super important
because of the following.
How many people in this room
now, in every 24 hour window,
including when they sleep are
always within arm's
reach of their telephone?
I mean, it is literally the
preview of us becoming robots.
Literally, it is.
So this is the most
important device in our lives.
Do you know how
important this has become to me?
Literally, I would rather
somebody roll up on me in
New York City, steal my wallet
and stab me in the stomach
with a knife then lose my phone.
(audience laughter)
That's how important it is.
So, my friends, this
if you agree as I do.
How many people here are
lucky enough to have a 13 to
18-year-old grandchild or
sibling or child in their lives?
Raise your hand.
I think you guys
know, this is it.
Not even the laptop.
As a matter of fact, even, old
dude, 40 years old I now only
travel with my phone.
I no longer need my laptop.
I do everything on this device.
The average 15-year-old in the
world, not America, in the world
when coming home goes to their
room and spends all of their
attention time on this.
There is no television.
There's no going
through their direct mail.
There's no shit like that.
There's no going your landing
page optimization horse shit.
It's this.
(audience laughter)
And here's where it starts
getting really serious for me.
Because I view social media
and I know, I did my homework,
I know where social media sits
in this room as importance.
Let me give you a quick preview.
Shit.
(audience laughter)
Social media, my friends,
there's no such thing
as social media.
It's a word.
Let me tell you
what social media is.
Social media is the slang term
for the current state
of the internet.
And when you wrap your
head around that shift all of a
sudden it's not as easy
to kind of like diss it.
And if you wrap your head around
the following data, you'll start
paying real close attention.
This is the most important
tool and not just by the way to
14-year-old girls.
Do you know that on Instagram
the fastest growing demo taking
selfies are 42 to
45-year-old females?
Literally, cougar selfies.
(audience laughter)
So, this is the most
important device in the world.
This were all of you are
gonna sell your homes and your
information and your
office space from.
Wrap your head around it.
That's where it's gonna
be words can be sold.
And now follow me, those
five logos and the other seven
websites that are important in
social media,
they represent 53%
of all minutes
spent on a cell phone.
More than half the time of every
consumer, all ages, across the
board, is spent on those
platforms and most of you aren't
doing dick on any of them.
(audience laughter)
Zero, goose egg and if
you are you're mailing it in.
You're putting some
random bullshit.
You are playing in a place where
it's email, it's your website.
Your website that many of you,
by the way, three of you,
three of you, I don't
know you guys are.
Three of you when I went to
your website weren't
even mobile optimized.
Weren't even native
to a mobile device.
And you know who you guys are.
You haven't even made your
website work on a mobile device.
Even though in the next 24
months three-fourths of all
internet consumption will
happen through a mobile device.
So, I don't know.
I don't know what
you're waiting for.
I don't know what
process you're interested in.
What thing you're gonna do but
what I do know is that you think
that your customer is
not on it and they are.
That's your vulnerability.
I know what's happening.
You think your 49-year-old Sally
and your 57-year-old Stan
is not on it and that's who you
sell to and that's why you
disrespect it because
what you're doing is you're
disrespecting what's
actually happening in the world.
For example, how many people
this room have sent an emoji
via text? Raise your hand.
Raise your hands high.
I want everybody to look around.
This is not a 14-year-old
audience except for Caleb.
This is not--
(audience laughter)
This is not a 14-year-old
audience yet
36 months ago most of you
didn't know what an emoji
was and now here we are today
36 months later and there are
60-year-old men literally
texting OMG and sending
shit emojis to each other.
(audience laughter)
It's the truth and you know
it because what you haven't
realized is the following;
what technology is doing is
aging down people.
Guys, what technology is doing
right now is it's
aging down people.
If you're lucky enough to be
sitting here right now and you
are of the age and you're
fortunate that your parents are
still alive and you're of the
age where you could remember
your parent at the
age you are right now.
If you're lucky enough right
now, stick with me, that you're
lucky enough to know your parent
that you're a kid and you knew
your parent at the age you are
right now, let me give you a
preview, you are much younger
than they were
at this age for them.
You should, the average
45-year-olds dress and actions,
what she spends money on maps a
28-year-old woman
only 10 years ago.
Technology is bringing our age
down quickly and so you will
quickly be on Snapchat because
for the 32-year-old woman going
to be cool and important to be
on Snapchat in 40 seconds if it
isn't already and in LA,
New York and San Francisco
it already is. Got it?
This is just historical.
This is what happens and so what
I know is this entire room wakes
up in five years, five, 
I know there're six of
you retiring in 10
but this entire room wakes up
in five years and your customer
that's gonna sign million-dollar
leases and buy--
My entire social network,
my actual friends, four of them
have bought $3 million homes or
above through
social media in the last year.
My buddy just bought a
$700,000 watch from Instagram.
You know what I call that?
ROI.
GE one of the biggest
brands in the world, we sold a
multi-hundred million
dollar jet engine on LinkedIn.
Not by spamming them either.
Content.
If you do not understand that
every single person in this room
is now a media company,
then you don't understand
what's happening.
If you do not understand that
you are a media company first
and then you sell homes if you
do not understand that you're a
media company first
and then you sell wine.
If you don't understand that
your media company first and
then sell clothes or information
or this that and the other
thing, then you are not
understanding what's actually
happening and you are going
to be in deep fucking shit.
(audience laughter)
And I mean it because
I promise you this, my friends,
much bigger companies than yours
and I have been
disrupted by technology.
Borders and Barnes & Noble's
were better businesses than
yours when Amazon came along.
And this is happening at
scale and what you don't know if
you're not completely all-in
on this is what happens when
there's exponential
scale of maturity.
The internet is 20 years old.
And I know there's some,
"Actually in 19," I know, nerd,
but I mean--
(audience laughter)
I mean the consumer internet.
When normal people have
gone on it is 20 years old.
If you look at the growth of
everything that's happened in
the last five years, 
it is insane.
Yet globally still only 11
to 14% of the e-commerce is
happening on the internet.
It's just started and if you are
not adjusting to this reality
you are massively vulnerable.
So while this room 
spends a lot of time on tactics,
and by the way,
tactics are massively
important and I'm pretty aware
of the programming here,
tomorrow really fucking matters.
Those tactics are
gonna really matter.
They matter because
tomorrow matters.
And next Thursday matters and
the following Sunday matters.
Right?
You're living now but the bottom
line is everybody's way too
addicted to the quick tactic.
What's gonna make me money
tomorrow while not recognizing
the macro trend that is looming.
If you aren't, I mean I never,
I'm constantly spending 20%, 30%
of my money and energy on shit
that doesn't have a prayer to
bring me any value in the
first year that I do it.
That's called building a brand.
That's called building
a long-term business.
That's called actually building
for something more than the cash
flow that I make that year and
that is been the separator for
me in my career, that is the
separator for people that win at
the highest levels and even
if your ambition stays quite
humble, it's a prerequisite
to not be put out of business.
It's just the way it is.
Now, how much time do I have?
Good?
-  I'm not sure,
how much time does he have?
(audience chatter)
I'm gonna go 10 more minutes
and then I'm going
to do some Q&A.
I want to spend 10 minutes
on emotional intelligence.
My friends, in America, which
is the number one competitive
entrepreneurial market in the
world, to be in the top
1% of earners in America you
have to make $400,000 a year.
I really want to start
talking about practicality.
This whole notion that everybody
has to make millions and
millions and millions
of dollars is insanity.
We have to recognize if you
actually have the talent to be
able to do that.
Building an actual
business takes talent.
You don't get to just build a
million dollar business 'cause
you read a fucking book or
'cause you want it or 'cause
"The Secret" is gonna fucking
help you do if
you wish for it enough.
(audience laughter)
It's not how shit works.
There's no 17 step
process if you suck.
(audience laughter)
There's no 17 fucking step
process for me to be fucking the
best basketball
player in the world.
It does exist.
There's no 17 step process
to make the fucking Beyoncé.
It doesn't exist.
(audience laughter)
We have to, at all costs,
reframe the conversation of
entrepreneurship and
building businesses.
If you actually took a step back
and became honest with yourself
and deployed self-awareness and
understood what you were good at
and what you were bad at.
I understood that
I was built like a robot.
That I don't need to drink,
that I don't need to eat,
that I don't need to fucking
sleep, well I need to sleep,
let me rephrase but I definitely
don't need to eat and drink.
Right?
To work 18 hours a day and that
is my competitive advantage.
I don't work 18 hours a
day because it's fun.
I don't work 18 hours a
day 'cause it's cool.
I don't work 18 hours a
day for kicks and giggles.
I work 18 hours a day because
I want to win, I want something
and it is the thing that I can
do better than
anybody I've ever met.
I've never met anybody in
my entire life who can work
18 hours a day, every day,
forever until they die.
That's me!
My brother can't do that.
Nobody I've ever met can do that
and so they shouldn't do that.
A lot of people I meet can
fucking destroy it in nine hours
and have algorithmic heads
and could do amazing things and
they're the closest people I've
ever seen the passive income
because they run math arbitrage
and scale against markets and
that's God bless.
Everybody in here has three to
four core things that they're
better at within themselves than
everything else they do and the
quicker that every one of you
looks in the mirror and actually
has that honest moment with
yourself and starts to deploy
all, I didn't say some, all of
your energy against those three
or four things the quicker
you will maximize everything
starting with happiness,
followed by money.
We are spending way too much
time and energy trying to be
good at things that
we can't be good at.
It's just real talk and there
is a how big is the
business you said?
I just heard you.
The information business?
How big was that?
Good, that entire fucking
business is built on telling
people how to fix things they
suck at when they
can't maximize it.
That's the truth.
Way too many
people can't get there.
It is against everything
you hear from everybody.
I get it.
I understand how I sit on this
island very by myself in the
ecosystem, but fuck man,
let me say this: think about the
thousand people that are the
most famous and successful in
the world and they all have
only one thing in common.
They fucking punted everything
besides that one talent and
spent every fucking minute in
their lives on that one talent.
(audience applause)
That's their common trait.
Now, now, does that not mean
that you could be the best
entrepreneur that you could
be if you put in the tactics?
Absolutely but you better be
ready to swallow that that means
that you make 87,000 a year
'cause that's the
talent that you have.
You could've made 42,
you did the process,
you put in the work,
you tried really hard.
You fuckin' really wanted
it and now you make 87.
That's pretty good.
I could be a much better jump
shooter if I fucking took a
1,000 jump shots every day
playing basketball
but I still don't think I'm
getting in the NBA.
(audience laughter)
And the reason I'm coming with
this to end is the following,
not because I want to be Debbie
Downer, not because I want to be
like, "Look, I'm a really good
entrepreneur and you're not."
It's because if you start
betting on your strengths maybe
you're just organized, maybe
your great operator, maybe you
should be a number two or number
three in somebody's organi--
guys, the gal that was number
30 at Facebook made a fuck load
more money than a lot
of us being on our own.
There's a lot of ways to go
about it that aren't predicated
on just being the
number one and being that.
It is an absolute real
conversation that needs to start
happening in entrepreneur-land
and business-land of actual
self-awareness to
strengths and weaknesses.
It has to happen.
It has to happen.
The data is not on the side of
the current narrative and
so we need to deploy it.
Again, you can absolutely
maximize your marketing skills.
You can absolutely be a better
copywriter today then you were a
month ago if you practice and
you see the results but please,
please understand that practical
optimism is an absolute
blueprint for
success versus blind hope.
It's real.
It's real and you
know the funny part is?
Most of you know it.
Most of you know it deep down in
your belly and so
what is it all mean?
It means that you only have so
much time and energy and if you
can figure out what to deploy
it against you will
maximize success.
And I think it's a very
important time to start having
that conversation because there
is other things that happened.
There's tough markets,
there's downturns in economies,
there's other variables and
that's where betting on your
strengths has
the biggest upside.
So as we head in to Q&A,
what I really want to
focus on is attention.
You know, like
attention is the asset.
It's the asset.
I mean if you just spend your
time trying to understand where
people's attention is and where
is it overpriced and where is it
underpriced, you will
make a lot of money.
If your competitors are buying
ads in newspapers and sending
direct mail while you're doing
Google AdWords and Facebook,
you will make a lot of money.
You just will.
As a matter of fact, as a
tactic, I would highly recommend
spending a lot more time
surveying and asking your
friends and
customers what they do.
I mean it.
You know what's one my
favorite things to do?
Look at the home,
actually, you know what?
Everybody do this real quick.
Look at your phone.
You know wheat's really
interesting about your phone?
And this is why I grab so
many people's phones when I'm
traveling, if you look at the
home screen of your phone you
would be blown away how big of
an indicator the apps on your
home screen are to
who you actually are.
If you really look
at it, it's stunning.
I can like when I interview
people for like type A jobs
actually grab their phone a lot
to make sure there's like a lot
of like Evernote and calendars
and organize shit on there.
It is an unbelievable indicator
onto who you are and a great
insight into what that person's
about and things of that nature.
These are the places that
we need deploy our energy.
Attention and self-awareness.
They are the rocks of high
success in the future market.
Thank you.
(audience
applause and cheering)
- Alright, cool,
 so I guess 
#AskGaryVee show live.
-  Yes, let's do it.
- You up for that?
Can you do Q&A?
I don't know.
-  Hell yeah, let's do it.
- I'm just kidding, man.
200 shows, we up to 191.
- We're up to 191.
- Good. Is this episode 191?
I don't know.
- What's your name, my man?
- My name's Ross.
- Ross.
-  Gary, you sold me on
Snapchat, I'm convinced.
-  Yes.
-  I see the
value for personal brands.
-  Yes.
-  And I see the value
for big corporate logo brands.
-  Yes.
- What I'm missing is how do
I use it as a small logo brand?
Where like behind the scenes
isn't really that interesting
for my customers.
- Why would it be interesting
for a personal brand but
not a small business?
Very quick, you're just looking
for the excuse in this scenario.
It's always the story, right?
Why would it be big business and
why would it be one person but
not a small business?
What you have to do is
figure out how to make the
small business
interesting, right?
Now, the mistake a lot of people
make is they think they need to
be a charismatic individual
to help their small business.
Right?
The truth is you need to
think about your genre. Right?
There's a lot of things, for
example, I know there's a lot of
real estate people, I think the
most interesting thing that a
real estate agent can do
is own their territory.
So, for example, a small
business, an eight person real
estate firm is a small
business logo, right?
I think they should go and
interview all 100 people that
matter in that town.
The principal, the person
that owns the bagel shop.
The person that's lived
there the longest in town.
You see where I'm going?
Being a content producer is hard
but it's equally as hard for a
big business as it
is for a person as it is
for a mid-sized business.
They're all hard.
There's a lot of people, the far
majority of people don't win as
a big business.
The far majority of people
don't win as a individual.
The far majority don't
win as a small business.
What you need to do is figure
out what the right story is that
brings people value regardless
of where you sit there.
-  Great, thank you.
-  You got it, brother.
Questions.
-  Hey Gary.
- What's your name?
-  Kim. I was on
episode 172 of #AskGaryVee.
- Awesome, man.
(audience laughter)
- My question for you is I'm in
marketing and marketing business
it seems that a lot of people
trying to replicate what you do.
They're puting out
content which is awesome.
What's your recommendation on
them standing out in the field
of people that are
trying to play at that level?
- I think the way I stand out
is I don't follow anybody else.
All I do is follow people and
then I'm the first to report on
things and that's my
competitive advantage.
I think one of the mistakes a
lot of people do is they think
it's a good strategy to follow
thought leaders regurgitate it
and then be micro versions of
that and they pick up the scraps
and they do but you not to stand
out because by nature if you're
following, you're following.
What I would tell marketers to
do is actually, so I have such a
big advantage, I market for
the biggest brands in the world.
I market for Wine Library.
I market for my own book.
I sold 120,000 copies of
#AskGaryVee this week.
(audience cheers)
Do you know how many marketing
gurus sell 2,000, 3,000 copies
for the whole week
when it launched?
Again, this is why want the
whole market to
become way more cynical.
If you go look at the people
that are selling advice and they
have a book and they sell 6,000
copies for the whole fucking
first month, there's a problem.
Because aren't you supposed to
use that marketing advice to
sell your fucking shit?
(audience laughter)
Like, seriously?
What I would say is go out and
do marketing like if you going
to be marketing advice, go and
do marketing that has nothing to
do with marketing advice,
see how it actually works and
then go report on how it works.
Yeah.
 Is it on?
Just yell.
-  Testing, testing.
- There we go.
-  Awesome.
- What's your name?
-  I'm Emil Buggies,
I actually flew down
from Japan to come
see you, I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.
(audience applause)
- Thank you so much.
-  Thank you, yeah.
And I'm looking
forward to reading the book.
I downloaded the audiobook
as well 'cause
I heard it's a different--
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
-  In Japan I do
a lot of airBnB things.
Right now I'm renting out a lot
of apartments and listing them
on airBnB so airBnB management
type stuff but the end user
comes through airBnB.
We don't really have
direct access to--
- To them.
-  business or platform so
how does a business like us go
about promoting ourselves?
- So how are you
guys organized as?
Are you buying these?
Are you
representing the apartment?
What's you act, like how's
your business structured?
-  So we just we
rent apartments, okay, but--
- And then list them.
-  And then
list them, yeah.
- You're arbitraging airBnB.
-  Exactly.
- I think you need to create
a consumer facing either,
like again, this is in, back
to your similar question.
This is where I love this
question, this is where I think
I separate myself
from a lot of marketers.
Okay that's what you do but what
you can do is be a level up.
Again, think of content and
being a media com--,
if you're a media company first
like I saw a lot of you react
when I said your
media company first.
If you thought like that, 
you do apartment 
arbitrage you wouldn't
be asking me this question.
What you're doing, you're doing
but a lot of people do is you
thinking about your business and
your thinking about content as a
gateway drug to a transaction.
It's number two.
If you thought of yourself as
a media company first and then
somebody who does that arbitrage
with airBnB, you'd be putting
out content of the neighborhoods
and the area and the city.
Got it?
If you were positioned as a
information to Japan 
and we have this service
that lets you stay
in these apartments,
your whole world 
would be different.
If you had a guide of 10 best
places to eat sushi in Japan and
that was your gateway
drug to the transaction,
you'd think totally different.
We have to separate marketing as
a gateway drug to a transaction
and being a content company.
So what I would do if I were
you is start doing the, you'd be
blown away, I mean 
absolutely blown away 
by the capabilities of targeting
people on Facebook or Twitter
that are saying they're going to
Japan, putting out an article
that says eight great places to
eat sushi in Japan and then
using that as a gateway drug
because at the end of that
article or on the left side of
the article or however you
decide to UI and UX it,
there's a transaction to
stay in your places.
But that takes a totally
different commitment,
bro, right?
That takes you hiring an
editor-in-chief to be in charge
of the content when you're like,
"What are you talking about?
"I fucking rent out
fucking apartments, Gary.
"You fucking maniac."
(audience laughter)
And so when I think about
the world the way I see it, you
know, people see the
world differently.
I see all of you needing an
editor-in-chief or
you needing to be that.
And I get why it sounds weird
for your business to have one.
I don't give a shit,
I know I'm right.
So that's the shift that I see.
That's where I see you
having a real opportunity.
I would look at those locations,
I would take a 10 mile radius of
everything that's around it and
I would become the number one
content producer in the world
of every museum, park, sushi,
restaurant, fucking
theater, fuckin' everything.
(audience laughter)
You got it.
(audience applause)
And by the way, the advice
I just gave you is hard,
borderline expensive and you've
got to be patient as fuck to get
any pay dirt out of
what I just told you.
You'll hate me for 18 months and
then you'll kiss my
fucking face in 24.
(audience laughter)
Got it?
-  I see my my man Scott
Lachtman here hurting his neck
from nodding so hard 'cause
that's what he did
in his area, man.
I love it.
-  Hey Gary.
-  Hey, how are you?
-  My name's Georgie,
I've got a company called
AfterTheRock.com.au and
I'm a wedding planner.
-  Amazing.
After The Rock, I like it.
-  Thank you.
.com.au for everyone else.
(audience laughter)
Link it up, DRock,
if you're here.
(audience laughter)
Gary, I'm launching an online
program teaching brides how to
plan their wedding kind of
Marie Forleo style
in about eight months.
-  Smart.
-  And I want
to go hard on my--
-  Can
I question real quick?
-  Yes.
-  Why eight months?
-  Because I'm
practitioner like I'm in the
business with a hell of a lot of
weddings coming up and I really
want to do a massive push
with my content and my marketing
before I launch.
-  Got it.
-  And I want to
give a hell of a lot of value,
and I've been testing it.
It's ready to go, I'll be
testing it and changing
it as I go. But I just want
to be launching hard.
So I really want to know, I got
ideas of doing, well not ideas,
I've got plans of on Snapchat
series and all sorts of things
I just want to how you would
market it for 2016, 2017?
- So the one disadvantage I have
is I haven't fully audited the
Aussie market for that.
We have some clients that do
work here that I've some reads
on so I don't think people
realize Australia is one of
three best markets for
Facebook in the world.
From the thing that
I trade, attention, the depth of
interaction per content
here is unbelievable.
I think, before you fancy with
everything else, make sure you
dominate Facebook because
the ability to target is so
incredible in that environment.
The first thing comes to mind
right away is what's going on,
I don't know but the first thing
I would do if you like if I was
like really working to the
first things I would do is audit
Pinterest very aggressively
and understand what's happening
there and understand
infographics and
things that nature.
But look, I think if you're at
a place where you know to say,
"DRock, link it up," and you've
been watching my stuff,
it's the whole theme
of this talk. Right?
I mean if you think about a
bride, if we're gonna generalize
that they're not you know on
their second marriage or maybe a
woman that decided to get
married later,
they're young women
for the most part.
They only live here.
They only live in the phone.
They only live on those places.
I would say Instagram is
probably an incredibly,
that I know for fact,
in this market so Instagram
is very, very important.
I think they should probably
starting now for a 8 month from
now launch, I would be searching
hashtags engaged, all those
hashtags and I would start
building relationships right now
with women that just got engaged
or engaged in last six months
just got married because if they
could be ambassadors or things
of that nature I truly think
the attention on Instagram from
individuals is on believable.
Right?
There's a lot of models in
Australia like I would even
though they may not be engaged
or married I would look at them
and try to figure out what
your narrative is with them.
I think that's a great arbitrage
but it comes down
to quality content.
The fact that you're in the
trenches and actually do this
for a living
already has me excited.
If you scratch your own itch
on content, you win, right?
If you actually have a business
that you're building content on
top of, I'm very
fruitful on that.
That's just gonna take patience,
time, effort and so that's what
I would say.
It's nothing crazy that
you haven't heard yet.
I think what you need to do is
understand, you're not going to
get as much out of it
as you think upfront and
you just need to stick with it.
Marie, you know, Red Cross shit
in 2009 it took her 3 years to
get into a place where it
started becoming anything.
Do you have the patience and
the tenacity to each shit for
36 months is the game.
-  Yeah.
Awesome.
-  It's the game.
-  Thank you for
everything you do, too.
-  You're welcome.
-  Thank you.
-  Thank you.
(audience appluase)
-  Hi Gary, ooh!
- You're good.
-  Hi, Gary, I'm DeAnne.
I'm so excited that you're here.
I love all the shit you do
and I'm one of the ones that's
supposed to be retiring but
I'm not now because of
what you're telling me.
- I love it.
-  One of the questions
I have here, I know that you
were when you did a podcast
recently with James Altucher you
talked about the
true north of truth,
the North Star of truth, rather.
And you said that people are
putting more content out, being
more and more honest the way
that you do it every day and
then I look at the kids who are
coming up supposedly 80% who
all they want to do is make
money and be famous and
I'm thinking well, how do those
two things go together because
all we're gonna have is these
kids who are oversharing to the
point where it's almost
pornographic and
frightened me at 53,
to go well shit if I have
to go up against that
I'm in real trouble.
How do you put those
two things together?
Where do you see
it going in time?
Do we have to do what you do?
-  Well no, I mean look,
everybody has to do
what's like there's, no.
If you're gonna map, hold on
to the mic 'cause I have some
questions for you.
And I think you might've saw
this in a DailyVee and you're
gonna hear a lot of this out
of my mouth for the rest of the
year, I've no interest in
anybody doing what I do.
I have interest in communicating
what I do and then everybody
here is a big girl and boy you
can like look at that be like
alright, here's what I can do
that's this but I definitely
don't want to that
and this and that.
Are you asking me that because
so many people that are cut the
younger generation that they're
putting up so much content that
they're not going
to consume content?
'Cause I think that's it
very popular point of view.
-  Yes.
It's not only that they consume
it but they seem to overshare
about everything
that is out there and
a lot of it is just shit.
I'm not interested.
-  No, no, no.
A lot of it may be shit to you.
-  Yeah.
-  The problem is
you don't get to decide.
-  Yep, okay.
-  Right, so like when the
Kardashians become big in the US
and everybody says that's shit
television the problem is 
it's the number one
television show on TV.
Many people in here think
that footy or football or
American football is shit and
that's a waste of four hours but
it's my biggest escapism.
I said this the other day,
we are not allowed to judge
other people's escapism.
Some people think it's shit to
stay in line for four hours and
wait for Star Wars, other people
live for it every three years.
You know,
some people think,
I think it's shit to read
business books.
(audience laughter)
Let me just say
it one more time.
Let me just say it one more
time, I think it's a waste of
time to read business books.
So, you don't get to judge if
like scantily clad girls are
sharing everything
because you don't.
The market is the market.
Here's what I can tell you,
there's a great thing
about the market.
The bad thing is people get
sad when they hear that part.
They don't understand though
that the cream always
rises to the top.
There's a lot of people
that have tried to do what the
Kardashians have done.
There's been a lot of sports.
There's a lot of
pretty girls and boys.
Eventually the market
makes its decisions.
You may not be happy with what
the market picks 
but it makes it's decisions.
Instead of being crippled by
whatever, I don't even know what
anybody else does. Bless you.
Like, I don't have a fucking
clue what Tim Ferriss or
Tony Robbins or Oprah or
Altucher. I don't even know.
Don't even know and I would tell
you as much as you can take that
approach you need to worry about
what you do and what you want to
accomplish and what you want
people to get out of you and
what you want. Right?
-  Yeah.
- I have a friend who all he
wants to is make $100,000 year
so we can go to Jamaica
and smoke weed, right?
(audience laughter)
And that's awesome, God bless.
I mean I'd kill myself
if that was my ambition.
Right, so you know, everybody
gets to do what they want but
I think you're making a huge
energy waste
on trying to decide.
Do not judge the market.
Reserve all that energy and
time to focus on your thing.
You will put out stuff, your
community will come to you based
on what you're putting out
and if nobody's coming,
then you're not putting
out good shit, darling.
-  Yeah, okay.
Thanks Gary.
-  You got it.
(audience applause)
-  Gary, about, I don't
know how long, maybe five years
ago this guy was
my GaryVee then.
He tried to talk me
into it and you know what?
I did what you said,
I became a good 68 which has
been financially
fricking awesome.
-  That's right.
-  I'm not a LeBron.
I'm a really good 68 and
I rock because of his advice.
So this was my GaryVee
before I sort of played around,
I cheated on him with
the guy on the stage.
-  We can do a
threesome, don't worry.
(audience laughter)
-  Gary, it's GV.
-  How are you?
-  Yeah, Greg Vincent.
I just wanted to, I've been
watching you on your
Wine Library and I saw your book
launch at 2 o'clock the other
morning and it's
just amazing to see.
-  Thank you.
-  I just want to ask--
-  Yes.
-  'Cause real estate
agents are basically distrusted.
-  Distrusted?
-  Distrusted and
across the profession.
What are some of the things
you'd recommend from a trust
based marketing approach?
-  I have a
really good idea on this.
And this is something that I've
deployed to some friends in the
U.S. in real estate that's
really worked for them.
And it's a little bit and
it's fun that you watched
Wine Library TV.
It's a very controversial
thing to wrap your head around.
So what you probably remember is
I panned the wines that I sold.
It was my store,
we sold these wines.
I would sit in front of a camera
and I would say this wine sucks.
It's off balanced,
there's too much frite,
you know, this and that.
As a matter of fact, I don't
know how many of you know this,
probably very few,
maybe one or two.
In 1998, 1999 I was one of the
loudest voices in America about
the whole Borossa
Valley explosion in the U.S.
I was a huge advocate.
I loved here.
I came here a bunch.
I came here four
times in five years.
But then, the Borossa
Valley wines got really too big.
Way too fruity, 
way too alcoholic
and I started 
going the other way.
Didn't come here as often.
(audience laughter)
You guys weren't
super happy about that.
But it was super weird.
And by the way, these were
people that invited me into,
I would sit on camera, at one
point the show got very big.
Four, 500,000 people watching a
video where I'm tasting a bottle
of wine and saying it's rubbish
when this is was somebody three
years ago who let me
sleep in their guest room.
Very tough shit.
But I was always obsessed
with being honest
with the other person.
I don't think it's a great
way to get listings by making a
video and telling everybody that
even though the inspector will
say so I think you
need to replace the roof.
I don't think the person selling
the home is going to be pumped
with you after they
gave you the listing.
However, that might
be an extreme version.
But if you, instead of
saying this is an up-and-coming
neighborhood if you're like
look, this neighborhood is seven
years away from really popping.
If you're cool with that, great.
But too many of my friends
and I follow this space pretty
carefully are saying
is the next Brooklyn.
And they know in their
hearts that it's 10 years away.
So why the fuck
are they saying it?
Because they want the
transaction instead of
building the brand.
My friends, I didn't want to
sell you more wine
on Wine Library TV.
I wanted to become
the world's wine guy.
And that allowed me to leave
that business day in and day out
and it still does it's business
while I went on
to do other things.
Had I looked for the
transaction, I'd still be there.
Do you understand?
Do you get it?
So GV, the way you do it
is by telling the fucking truth.
And it's really hard.
When you represent her and now
you're making a fucking video on
your phone saying the
fucking lawn is a piece of shit.
(audience laughter)
And so I don't, I can't tell
you what to do but I can tell
you the further you 
get away from the truth
the more likely you're
not going to win long-term.
It's basic as fuck.
You know it's true.
You don't want to do it because
it hurts your short-term money.
I get it.
Do you but it doesn't change it.
It doesn't change the
fact that that's right.
It doesn't change it.
Do you understand?
Just 'cause you want it to be
that way, it doesn't change it.
You got it.
-  Thanks buddy.
(audience applause)
-  You need to be
prepared, young lady.
-  Hey Gary,
how are you doing?
-  I'm doing
well, my friend.
-  My name is Matt.
-  Matt.
-  The other week you
put up a bartering thing on your
book for I can offer you
something and I have to buy a
certain amount of books
to make it come true.
I offered to be your driver
whilst you're in Sydney and
they kept saying no.
-  Yes.
-  So, I'll take another
swing, I'm asking you now,
what can I do for you?
Buy books?
Sandy hand job?
Whatever is going-- 
(audience laughter)
to drive you back to
the airport tonight.
- Let me, hold on let me see.
I think they're
saying no for a reason.
Let me see if it's still there.
-  Good hustle, man.
-  The hand
job sounds amazing.
-  It's inappropriate
but good hustle.
(audience laughter)
-  Yeah, so this is
why my team is the best.
The reason I don't, the reason
I can't is that I'm leaving at
6:30 from my hotel and from
6:30 to 7:30 I'm dealing with a
pretty important business
issue, that's a negative.
They know that if it's
a negative, forget it.
I'm trying to hold on to a
client that's not happy.
I'm just not in the
right mindset to have that
conversation, you
know what I mean?
-  Yeah.
- So, I apologize
but let me think.
I'll talk to you before I leave.
Cool. I appreciate the effort.
-  In a
quiet room somewhere.
- You know what's funny?
You know what's funny is that
it's amazing to me how much
I obsess over tenacity.
There's a real no that I should
be giving you and I'm fighting
for you 'cause I just
love and by the way,
it's really important to me.
I am blown away, by the way,
the quickest reason that I know
there's so many not real
entrepreneurs in the marketplace
right now and I'm an investor in
a lot and watching people is a
real entrepreneur
just never gives up.
You're kind of like dead
before you before you give up.
I really appreciate the tenacity
and I appreciate the tactic.
It's not creepy or rude or
pulling up, it's just I mean it.
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook,"
how many people read it
or know the spiel, right?
A lot of people confused by
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook" and
that's why I started
writing articles about it.
A lot of people think it's, for
most of you that haven't read it
it's over there, here's what it
stands for give, give,
give and then ask.
Not give, give, give
and then you're entitled.
I given away 200 episodes of
#AskGaryVee and DailyVee and
answered a million fucking 
emails and Snapchat this and 
this and this, 
like all sorts of shit.
And then, plenty of people
are not buying the book.
I just read 100 tweets on the
way, long fucking flight here.
You know, 100 tweets of like
literally people that are like,
"Nah, I watched every episode of
"#AskGaryVee so I'm not
going to buy the book.
"I probably got all
the information."
Literally, literally 20 minutes
shows times a buck-eighty
and I couldn't get
them to a place
where they wanted
to buy one $18 book.
And I'm okay with that
'cause that's the market.
Because the advice
I gave you, darling,
is the same advice
I live every day.
They don't want to.
It's just the way it is.
So give, give,
give and then ask.
And it's just the ask, right?
That's all you get.
My man?
-  Hi Gary.
-  I'm well.
-  Hi Gary.
My name is Iman from Singapore.
I flew in from
Singapore to see you as well.
-  Thank you.
(audience applause)
- I remember that in one of
your big videos on posted this
recently, the breakout
video where you spoke at the
conference in the U.S.
and you talked about growing a
business with users and then
flipping it is not
a business model.
-  That's right.
-  Right.
-  That's a
business model.
It's business model
for like 11 people.
Building a big business that
gets a million users on an app
and then you raise more money
and you're still
not making money.
It was a business
model for Instagram.
He made $1 billion.
The problem is there's
four fucking Instagrams.
And there's 80,000 apps that 
were deployed to 
the app store today
that have the model of 
I'm gonna get a million users
I'm going to raise money and
then I'm going to exit.
And so, in the context of
that conversation you just saw
everybody is grounded, it is a
business model,
I'm just not 
super intrigued by the
.00001% business model.
-  I absolutely agree
and I believe that that so many
people in Singapore and
Asia need to see you.
So my question is how many
people are we going
to speak to in Asia?
-  How many what?
-  How many people in
Singapore would you
like to speak to you?
-  All of them.
How many would I like to?
-  Yeah.
-  You want me to
go to Singapore with you?
Tonight?
(audience laughter)
You'll drive us, 
we'll get hand jobs, 
we'll go to Singapore,
it'll be great.
(audience laughter)
-  But this is an
absolutely serious ask.
-  So honestly, 
on a serious ask we,
you're gonna love 
what I'm about to say.
We open VaynerMedia
London next month.
-  Yep.
-  And I've already got
all the paperwork in place,
we will be we are going to open
up VaynerMedia Singapore in the
next 24 to 36 months so you'll
be seeing too much of me in Asia
and in Singapore specifically.
-  Thank you.
(audience applause)
-  Up the back, up the
back, up the back, at the back.
You gotta stand
up, my beautiful?
-  Hi Gary, thank you
so much for coming in today.
So my question is well today
you spoke a lot about
playing to your skill.
-  Yes.
-  And I'm just
wondering how did you find--
-  And by the way, by the
way, not only skill, strength.
Right?
-  Strength, yeah.
-  How did I find it?
-  Yeah,
how did you find it?
Did it just click one day
or did you always know it?
-  So for me it did
but I got different stories.
I'm wrong, I'm the
wrong kind of blueprint.
I realized it in
third grade. Right?
I basically gave up at school
when I was like 10 years old
'cause I already knew.
This is why I'm trying to
figure out self-awareness.
Why did get so lucky that even
at 10 and 11, do you know how
tough it is to be ridiculed and
be called stupid at 10 and
11 years old when you
know you're special?
It sucked.
It was like, talking about
eating shit, I ate shit for
basically most of my childhood.
My friend's moms literally did
not want, my friends hanging out
with me because I was an
F student but I was spending all
my time honing my skill
that I knew I had and
I was really working on it.
I definitely feel better about
giving this advice than I do
finding self-awareness,
I would take every inclination,
every passion, every curiosity
and I would spend every minute
even at 90 or nine years old
trying all the things that come
to mind and trying them.
Guys, if you have the audacity
to want to live a highly
financial successful life,
if you have the audacity,
if you're sitting here, I mean
this is a business conference.
I don't think you're here
for fucking kicks and giggles.
I don't think you're
here to hear music.
If you have the audacity 
to be financially successful
you need to understand a
couple of things.
One, it's rare.
Like, it's rare.
There's not that many
people that have it.
Number two, you need
to give up on leisure.
Like, if you want the good stuff
you're not going to
able to golf every day.
You're not going sailing
the whole fucking summer.
I had my first kind of summer of
my life last year which meant
we bought a house 
in the Hamptons
and I went there
for the weekends.
You've a lot of time.
If you're willing, if you want
good stuff, if you want to be
happy and rich,
you have 15 hours a day,
minimumly 12 
where you can do shit.
You can work your job and pay
your fucking bills for seven or
eight and then you have
fucking six, seven other hours.
I always say this in the U.S.,
stop watching "House of Cards."
Stop playing
fucking "Call of Duty."
Stop going to every
fucking footy match.
No more fucking happy hour.
Go and fucking sing and then
paint and then try to copywrite
and then fucking be a robot,
I don't fucking know but go.
It's a very easy answer.
It's very easy to
find your skill.
Go try shit.
(audience laughter)
It's just that, I have an
entrepreneur right now whose
business going to go out
of business in four months.
He's burning cash.
It runs out in four months.
Nobody is giving him money for
his next round because funding
is getting tough in the U.S.
Fucking went skiing
the last two weekends.
I don't know what the
fuck's the matter with people.
(audience laughter)
And then I have people,
my friends complain.
Do you know much how
I hate complaining?
You will never hear me complain
that I don't spend enough
time with my family.
I made my bed.
I'm sleeping in it.
Don't go to Australia for
11 hours if you want
to see your family.
My buddy is like complaining.
Guy's made hundreds of millions
of dollars and I'm having dinner
with him the other night he's
like complaining the whole time
about not seeing his family.
I'm like, "Fuck you.
"Just go spend time
with your family.
"I have no empathy
for your bullshit."
In the same way I don't have
empathy for my friends who are
like, "Oh Gary,
you're so lucky."
I'm not fucking lucky.
I fucking worked.
Fucking worked my ass off.
I'm lucky?
You fucking get home every night
at five o'clock and do dick.
(audience laughter)
You're lucky.
(audience laughter and applause)
I secretly took this
conference, for one,
I loved your tenacity but
secretly took it because
it's kind of a vacation to
be in a plane for 19 hours.
To answer your question, 
it's actually 
stunningly practical
and easy to find a skill
that can work for you.
It's having a process that
allows you to cut out everything
but trying things for three
months, six months, two days,
four weeks, just try shit.
You know?
It's really just trying shit.
Look, I'm a really
good public speaker.
I was 34 for the first
time I took the stage.
I didn't know.
You know?
It just happened.
So that's what I would do.
-  Last one.
You're gonna have to
put the rest #AskGaryVee.
We got one more then we got
to do some stuff
at the back, yeah?
- Yes.
-  Here's Paul but guys
if you've got one unanswered,
#AskGaryVee.
There you go, man, you got
your next little bit of content.
Paul.
-  Good day, mate.
Hello?
- Yo.
-  I'm on.
You've mentioned some awesome
stats and they're obviously, 
you live and breathe this stuff
and you do your research.
I don't know where
you do your research so
like the 53% of the public.
Where do you do your research
and keep your finger on the
pulse of where technology and
everything is going
in the next few years?
-  For me, I post-game.
I've been talking about the
phone and all this and then
people oftentimes will email me.
Like, "Did you see," and by
the way that 53% comes from
Forrester which is one of the
leading analytics places in the
world but I don't
know what they did.
I don't know if they surveyed
100 people and
then said these 53.
The truth is a lot of the stats,
I don't even care about them.
I know what's true.
I know that I'm selling more
stuff on Facebook ads that are
mobile than desktop for
Wine Library right now
that are my stats. Right?
I don't really care 
about analytics and
stats as much asmost people.
I know they work for people.
I know it's really
powerful when you hear it.
Again, I thought the most fun
for me today was when I went
through that
social media thing. Right?
Where I was like social media,
it's the slang term
for the internet itself,
the current state
of the internet.
Here's the phone. 53%.
I started seeing faces going,
"Fuck man, maybe I shouldn't,
shit maybe this is real." Right?
It's good for stuff like that
but, very honestly, I think it's
much more important to be
a practitioner and
live and breathe it.
I use it as post-game.
There is no stat that
ever made me do something.
And I think that, that's what
I would like everyone in
this room to understand.
Why are you not
willing to use common sense?
Why were you not willing three
years ago when your buddy Hank
who's 68 and works in the steel
mill, text you an emoji do you
not realize shit's changing?
You know, I would argue and
I would implore
you to understand,
you're living your life one way,
shit's happening and then for
some reason when you
put on your work clothes,
you think something
different's happening.
Let me save you time 'cause
this is a good way to end.
The reason you think something
else is happening when you put
your work clothes on is 'cause
you don't want to do the work
to adjust the reality
of the new market.
You just don't.
It's the truth.
And I get it.
Do you know how exhausting it is
for me to be right
after right after right?
(audience laughter)
No, no, no, no,
it's a funny joke.
I mean it.
At this point, I've got a
narrative of being right for a
pretty long time and to sit here
in front of you today and know
that if I'm not 
right in 24 months
 that it's over.
I don't get to sit at
the place where I sit.
You're only as good
as your last at-bat.
The market's constantly going
to change and so the copywriters
that when the best at magazine
that didn't believe in the
internet because they were
making money doing copywriting
in the back of a magazine,
well they fucking lost.
Do you understand?
They lost.
One great thing for all of
you to read and I don't know if
anybody's written the book on
it because I don't read those
things but you can Google
this, go educate yourself what
happened when the radio lost
it's number one
spot to the television.
It's the only thing you fully
understand philosophically to
understand what's about to
happen over the next 10 years.
If you understand that, you will
be more mentally prepared for
what you're about to deal with
and please and I'll leave you
with this 'cause
I know I'm leaving now.
Everything that's happened
in the last 10 years,
mobile devices, Facebook,
YouTube, all this shit,
it's gonna seem boring and
slow compared to what our
next 10 years are going to be.
It is.
It's exponential.
Caleb's generation doesn't
even know about anything else.
In 10 years, Caleb's 24.
He may rent an airBnB and
he's not gonna know anything.
He's not gonna know
what a banner and is.
Do you know what I mean?
He's not going to know.
They don't have email.
They're not going to
know any different.
It happens fast.
Don't disrespect it because
it will run your ass over.
All of you, including me, is
disrespecting it right now 
and some of you in this room
are really fucking lost and
disrespecting it a lot.
And here's your business
strategy (loud inhale).
(audience laughter)
You're hoping
hoping it doesn't happen.
You're sitting and saying
maybe if it just takes 15 years,
I'll be out and on the beach.
The market will put you on
the beach real fucking fast.
(audience laughter)
-  Thank you.
(audience applause)
Thank you.
(applause)
(rock music)
