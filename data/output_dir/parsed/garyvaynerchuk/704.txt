it is practical to make money around the
thing that interests you the most it's
amazing
even though crush it is the furthest
thing from what I've done in this space
it's still the truest we live in an
Internet age where niches are long and
deep and you can make money doing
anything and the thing you'll make the
most money on is the thing you like the
most because it's the thing you like the
most will allow you the work the hardest
and that will be the variable of success
and if you love it so much
you'll also research it more because it
was what you'd naturally do anyway in
your free time and then you'll work
harder and then you'll make money not
you're a fucking life coach
