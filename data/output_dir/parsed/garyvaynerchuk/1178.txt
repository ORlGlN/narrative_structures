ozzie asks why is your phone always in
the shop my phone is always in shot
because my phone is always with me plus
my adorable sans on there I don't want
to show his pictures Lizzie doesn't let
me share kids photos that much but the
other reason is because if you haven't
heard this is an extension of you as a
human being every one of you rarely is
ever arm's length away from your phone
in every 24 hour window including while
you're sleeping and showering this is an
extension of us this is you know
eventually it's gonna be here and here
and how a man eventually directly in us
this is the extension point and so it's
always with me because I need it to be a
human that's right it sounds sad
plenty comments coming like a but that's
just the way it is
