we wanted to change the roof.

They said forget it.

No, this is unpopular topics.
Say something out loud that you
think you actually believe
but a lot of other 
people don't agree.
Husain's laughing 
'cause he feels like that's his,
(group laughter), yeah.
You love being a contrarian.
This is a great 
game for contrarians.
By the way, I actually 
know that about you.
And actually, I know that about
you because the number one thing
that I look for with employees
is the ones who push against me
because they think, like 
India for example, right?
You know push for 
the sake of pushing and
actually don't believe it.
I do believe what you just said.
I think the current state of
parenting is fundamentally
broken and will be looked upon
as a bad place because I don't
believe in two 
cooks in the kitchen.
The blending on it 
is hurting parenting.
That divide and conquer of the
'50s and '60s actually is more
ROI positive.
Kind of like higher thought
of two cooks in the kitchen.
That there's a struggle, people
agreeing on these things is a
very difficult thing.
I think we all and I think it
creates an un-united front.
I think so.
Guys, you have to put 
teeth around it otherwise,
it's not gonna work.
No, really.
It's got to be 
things like parenting,
it's got to be the taboo shit.
- Well here's a 
related on to yours.
I think that there 
should be flights offered
with no children on them.
- Oh, that's interesting.
That's just a good idea.
(group laughter)
-  A whole airline.
- Do you believe that or 
is that just a random idea?
- No I don't 
like flying with kids.
- Yeah, I've always 
known you were a bad person.
(crosstalk)
Guys, with the technology 
around headphones and
things of that nature, 
it's become a non-factor.
- No.
-  No way.
