00- The fire I see in the eyes 
of the 19, 20, 25-year-old
that feels that 
they're entitled to this
and then the flip side
the diminishing just 
a little bit of ashes
with a little smoke left 
of that same entrepreneur
when they were 22 at 46
when practicality and
family dynamics and the history 
and the market tearing down
and the lack of that same 
opportunity has just
dwindled down to a moment 
where they don't believe that
they've got that shot and 
I'm here to tell you
you absolutely do.
There are absolutely a ton 
of entrepreneurs that started
their companies in 
their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s
when it was difficult 
to do such a thing.
Sidney Frank 
who created Grey Goose
didn't invent his big thing 
until he was in his 70s.
And so, I'm desperate.
I'm desperate to give 
you the springboard to say
"You know what? 
Instead of watching
"'House of Cards' seasons,
"instead of trying to 
go to ball games
"or things of that nature,
"yeah, I do have 7 P.M. 
'til 2 in the morning
"Monday through Friday."
Heck, for a lot of you the 
kids are out of the house.
Let's get into the 
practicality for the
late 40s, 50s, 60-year-olds 
that are watching this right now.
The kids are out of the house.
Yeah, you could pick up golf
or you could finally 
start that candle company
because you put pretty pictures
of candles on Instagram 
and it happens.
Learn the craft.
Figure out the 
opportunity at hand.
Go attack it.
You only live once.
When you're 90 to 
100-years-old and
you're regretting that you 
never built this business
and you let this era pass,
this moment where there's
so much entrepreneurial upside,
you'll regret it and 
regret is the worst.
I mean that's what it is.
