shit's changed the ship has sailed this
is here the ability for us to
communicate with each other is on like
Donkey Kong and that is absolutely
fundamentally changed everything and
we've seen it change dramatically the

watched by more people than are
subscribed to Wine Spectator and Robert

marketplace in 24 months leveraging the
power of these tools and that was oh six
pre-twitter and I was scared to use
Facebook because I didn't want to be the
creepy old guy peddling wines to the
kids
