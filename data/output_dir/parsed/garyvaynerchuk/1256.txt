matthew asks is it better to update your
social networks once a week with great
content or daily the poor content
Matthew why does it have to be one or
the other why not both I am so tired
that people think that this is kind of
like the thing that pisses me off the
most Oh Gary I see you hustle so much
but I don't work hard I work smart well
hey dickface I work both I work
ridiculously hard and I work obnoxiously
smart and that is my answer to this
question why not just put out a lot of
content often that is quality why does
one have to suffer or the other that is
a mistake mentality that is a middle
mindset go all in you can do both I do
