I'm here for business and so business is
inevitably going to understand that we
live in a very different game that the
rules have shifted the Internet
forget about social networks has changed
our world there were only twenty years
into the internet not even the internet
in the u.s. is basically Windows 95 got
people on your minds more 18 years it
it's early and so I think what they're
gonna realize is wait a minute
there is significant value in taking
money and putting it into people instead
of putting it into working media
shouting is fine
when it was the only alternative but
it's not anymore
