go map who you want to be like email
them cold and their inner circle until
one of them says sure you can work for
me for free as my admin or like chief of
staff and move to LA and do it it will
work here's why you can always go back
to what you're doing now in 24 months
the practical world is always open armed
so the whole thing is built for that's
what people don't get the practical
world the way school is built to be an
employee they're waiting for you always
they're always there for you is to me
that's how I see the world it's actually
a no-risk game it doesn't go away it's
always there
