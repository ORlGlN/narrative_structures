hunger is so massively underrated
absolutely you know when I I mean
everyday when there's something going
bad in business I think back to the fact
that my mom walked three miles to Kmart
to buy me two Star Wars figures when I
was six and I cried for two days two
freakin days because I knew we couldn't
afford it right well we'll find anything
I wasn't even 40 or so honestly the
biggest thing that separates people is
hunger
