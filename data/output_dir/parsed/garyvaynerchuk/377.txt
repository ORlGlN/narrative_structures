like we have to start getting into
meritocracy like somebody should leave
if they're not seeing where the puck is
going if you're driving a truck today
you know it's coming
you've heard it somebody told you at a
bus stop at a truck stop over dinner
somebody brought up this theory so
either you take it seriously and you
start educating yourself or you don't
like that's the game nobody's going to
fix that nobody can help you with that
that's life and that's the historic
nature of human beings forever
so just because we're now living and
it's our turn to go through something
this is always happened right it's
happening faster okay great so just
