into this notion of try your best it's
not about hiring it's about firing
that's the key it's not about who you
let in it's how you get them out if
they're not right that's the skill that
we should all be focusing on because
you're gonna miss too many in the up
front and so you know that's how I do it
I you know I'm an optimist I'm a half
glass full guy like nobody wants to be
interviewing at vaynermedia because
people walk in they have no skills are
like I feel it
this kid's got it rigged it's like like
Wall Street to to who's gonna be a ninja
like I'm bad I do everyone I think
everybody can do it so they kind of try
to take me out of the equation of hiring
a Boehner but then I always clown them
like but I hired you
