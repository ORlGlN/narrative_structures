-  Yeah, good so 
far in L.A., big day.
Big promotion day 
for Planet of the Apps
later with a 
little bit of a party.
And you're gonna get 
some real footage there, huh?
Did you get 
clearance to be there?
That'll be interesting.
Anyway, grinding,
grinding, grinding,
grinding, grinding, grinding.
("Where Im Going" by Jerry Folk)
- Why is there so little
energy around creating new IP?
Is it 'cause the studios don't
have appetite to take the risk?
The economics are so much
more fun with guaranteed--
-  The studios have IP 
that we could exploit,
but that's a good 
spot for them to work.
And...
- But everybody's 
just rebooting right?
It's just good ROI, right?
-  Yeah, and so for them 
it's a good business to just...
("Where Im Going" by Jerry Folk)
- Perfection is poison.
It's just another 
fucking excuse for not doing.
So many of you are using 
it as a high-brow excuse.
Everybody's always 
trying to tell people
why they can't 
or why they aren't.
Like excuses man, 
it's fucking poison.
I fucking hate excuses.
Prefer people that use 
like bullshit one's like
Uh, I grew up in 
a bad neighborhood.
The perfection one 
really fucking pisses me off.
'Cause people think they're
being clever and hiding it.
Oh, I'm a perfectionist, 
I do it right.
You don't do it right, Dick.
You're not doing it at all.
That's the problem, you're
doing it right theoretically
so often you 
never put anything out.
You know what's subjective?
Everything, 
everything is subjective.
Your song, your video, 
your social media posts,
your business idea, 
all subjective.
You know what's not subjective?
Putting it out on 
time, putting it out.
You know what's not subjective?
12:05 Eastern P.M.,
Tyler.
That's not subjective.
You know what's not subjective?
When you fucking grind 
on your flight out here
and get my inbox from 300 
things I have to do to 84.
Not subjective.
What was subjective 
was should it been 86
or should it been 82?
That's where you 
had to make a call.
People are crippled 
to not make calls.
So, they don't 
end up doing anything.
And then all you fuckers who
use perfection as a disguise,
you think you're 
smarter than everybody.
You may be 
tricking the losing players,
but the winning 
players see right through you.
(DRock inaudible)
I'm mad about 
this perfection thing.
I see it at VaynerMedia,
I see it with 
my business partners,
I see it with my start,
no, no, no, 
it's gotta be perfect.
I'm so close to 
having it perfect.
No you're not, you just 
don't want to get it done.
I don't like high-brow excuses.
I like low-brow excuses.
I like people, I like 
that dude the other day
at Washington Park who's like
"I'm just watching Netflix bro."
That's honest.
Somebody who's 
like, "Oh you know,
"I need to be inspired 
to get it exactly right
"'cause if I get it 
right it will win."
Just that stuff is like,
"Or you don't get 
it" like "I'm an artist.
"This is gonna 
be real right soon.
"I just need to..."
Shit, fuck that shit.
("Doo Wop" by J.I.D)
- How you doing, man?
- Man, good. How about yourself?
- Real good.
- Big shout out 
to you real quick,
because that day 
you posted my song man
I got so many people 
scoop my song off iTunes.
So, shout out to you for that.
Man, you stay on a plane, bro.
Every time I see 
you you on a plane.
- I live at the airport.
So what's been going 
on man, how's it going?
- Honestly, I've 
just been grinding.
You know, like 
really smashing it.
Just drop, 
after drop, after drop.
And each time I drop something,
I mean I can see 
the numbers go up.
So, you know, the consistency
it kinda feeds my--
- How often, once a week, 
once every two weeks?
- Last week 
I dropped three songs.
- Last week?
- Yeah, last week 
I dropped three songs.
A week before that 
I dropped two songs.
And it's usually 
one a week, but I just,
I'm just really 
trying to pump 'em.
Like I'm trying to make
sure that something--
- Is your mind in the 
place where I'm at which is,
it's just a matter of time.
It's literally just once--
- 100 percent.
- Like the reason you 
want to drop two or three is
it gives you more 
chance for have that song
that changes everything.
- Exactly. Exactly, it's--
- It's a numbers game.
- Yo it really is, it 
really is a numbers game.
- I believe that man.
- I genuinely believe it too.
I listen to your audiobook of,
the most recent 
one what was that?
- #AskGaryVee.
- Yes, dude, yo and 
this isn't to take any shots
because it's a bunch of 
amazing factual information.
The biggest thing 
I took out of that book
is pinpointing why I have been
so confident and successful
and it is because of 
how my mom raised me.
And I was never able 
to put my finger on that
until I saw you 
say it in that book.
I was just like you know.
- That makes sense.
- It literally, thanks to my mom
I feel like I can do anything.
- It's the best.
- I feel like she pumped 
me full of this confidence.
And I never pinpointed it--
- Did you call 
her and say thanks?
- Yes I really did.
She's my reason for everything.
(DRock inaudible)
What was that?
("Where Im Going" by Jerry Folk)
- Heading over to film
a TV show called (censored).
Gonna teach the aspiring
(censored) how to use social media
for my homie (censored).
She's awesome.
This should be interesting.
Shhh.
("Doo Wop" by J.I.D)
Just filmed a quick little TV
cameo that I'm gonna be doing.
So you'll be seeing that.
I'm not even sure 
if I can talk about it.
I'll hit up the peeps 
and ask them if I can.
Anyway, just 
business call, business call.
I've got an interesting meeting
with a holding company 
conglomerate that owns brands
that could be for VaynerMedia,
could be for my 
future ambitions.
Take a lot of meetings that
are not as black and white.
Way too many 
people only take meetings
where they get 
something out of it right away.
To me, I like 
taking meetings that
could bring value 
three, four, five,
six, seven years from now.
And if they do 
bring value right away,
then Mazel Tov.
Driving my social.
Getting serious 
about Snapchat again.
See a little opening there.
Work.
("Where Im Going" by Jerry Folk)

And we'll try not to hog you.

Forever.

- Awesome, sure thing, awesome.
("Doo Wop" by J.I.D)
So our commercial just aired.
My phone's blowing 
up, so that's cool.
And let's see what,
let's see what the buzz is.
Jason, I will 
never be big time, baby.
I'll always be a 
boy from Belarus.
Appreciate the love.
I could swear I just heard
your voice in the NBA game.
You know, it's funny.
This is a really 
interesting scene
because the 
event's going on inside.
Everybody's 
drinking a vodka martini
and I'm on Twitter 
engaging with everybody
who just saw the commercial 
during the NBA Finals.
It's just so fucking,
this right here is 
the difference moment.
I'm not in it for 
the glitz and the glamor.
I'm in it for the fucking,
the blood and the dirt.
Everybody can go party it up.
I'm fuckin' here workin'.
Okay.
It's still just a commercial.
Not that much chatter.
-  Really?
- Yep.
People don't get it, man
but let's not for this party.
- Who's that?
- It's me, it's GaryVee.
- Who's that?
- What?
- I've heard of this guy.
- I'll teach you, Jess.
That's what I'm here for.
(upbeat music)
-  Terrible.
-  Look handsome together.
-  Alright, photos.
- Come here for a selfie.
Keavis, Get out of the photo.
- I didn't know.
- Alright.
- Is this a Snapchat?
-  I kinda 
wanna be in that picture.
-  I'm the greatest.
- Jess, why are 
you the greatest?
- 'Cause I was born that way.
- Born that way.
(laughing)
