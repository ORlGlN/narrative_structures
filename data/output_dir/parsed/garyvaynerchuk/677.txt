I just genuinely want that for people to
understand look yourself in the mirror
in your hotel room tonight and say are
you putting in the work that supports
the words that are coming out of your
mouth my buddies always tell me I'm
gonna be a millionaire I'm like you're
on six softball teams John is your work
ethic mapping the bullcrap that's coming
out of your mouth cuz you talk a good
game you all talk about what you're
gonna do but then the work doesn't
support it
