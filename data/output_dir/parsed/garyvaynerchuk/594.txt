I think most people don't in but I think
the biggest reason most people don't win
is they don't know themselves or they
don't want to believe in what they know
about themselves and I think if you
could figure out who you are you're just
gonna be happier it's not about making a
million dollars a year there's so many
people listening right now that make two
hundred thirty seven thousand dollars a
year and they're miserable and they'd be
so much happier making a buck forty
three from eighty nine doing they
love or they're good at and we just
don't do that more and for what Lance
for like an extra like bike or wine or
better tickets to the Cowboys or Jesse
