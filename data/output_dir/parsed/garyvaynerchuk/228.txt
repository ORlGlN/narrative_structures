Look, I think the reason that you're seeing a lot of people in the biology sector
我觉得你在生物学领域看到的这些
biotech,  things of that nature...
还有生物科技等相关领域
Struggle is that people hold on to romance
问题是人们太一厢情愿了
People hold on to the establishment

Decision makers in your field
你所在领域的决策者们
oftentimes don't want to change
普遍不愿意做出改变
An entrepreneurship --
这种负能量对于企业经营
that energy is always disruptive
经常都是破坏性的
and oftentimes takes people that are on a pedestal
很多身居高位的人也因此
off that pedestal

There's human behaviors of defense.
人类有一种防守的本能
You have to understand that once somebody is at a pedestal

that they feel is the height of where they are

they start going on defense

the enormous advances we have in science is
我们得以在科研上取得的最大优势就是
everything is vulnerable
一切都变得不堪一击
I often say in entrepreneurship which I understand much better than biology
在创业领域——我对此比对生物学领域的了解要多得多
that Amazon put bookstores on notice early
亚马逊干掉了实体书店
Uber put car service
Uber把叫车服务
black limo companies

cab services on notice
还有的士业务干掉了
But everybody is vulnerable

I would argue because of the advances in technology
我觉得由于科技的高度发展
literally everything in every sector is today vulnerable
真的在所有领域一切都会在接下来的20年
over the next two decades
变得很脆弱
And so for me
所以要是我的话
I would take your energy and deploy it against the thing you're most passionate about.
我会把所有的精力都投入到最热爱的事情当中
Because it inevitably will be disrupted over the next two to three decades.
因为不管是什么在未来的二三十年都会被颠覆
This is gonna be fun. 这一集会很有意思

I have a question.
我有个疑问
For AI startup
对于人工智能领域的创业公司来说
it's very difficult for them to collect a lot of data
收集大量数据是很困难的
in their first 3 or 5 years
特别是在成立初期的3-5年
and they really need these data to improve their products and the algorithm

Big companies like Google-
其它像谷歌之类的大公司

and they can develop similar products using this data easily.

my advice is to not fight Google in a game

The number one rule I have about startups and entrepreneurs is
我对创业公司和企业家们的首要建议就是
when David is fighting Goliath

you never fight Goliath's game
你当然就别站在歌利亚这边了
So
所以
Your question
对于你的问题
if anybody was paying attention to如果有人也在考虑这个问题
makes this very easy
答案其实很明显
which is
那就是
Creating a business that is vulnerable to the Google infrastructure
经营一个直接面对行业巨头竞争的生意
or any other company for that matter
跟谷歌之类的大公司直接竞争
whether it's Amazon or Apple or Facebook
不管是亚马逊、苹果还是Facebook
It's just not smart
都是非常不明智的做法
and so what you need to do

that either you hope you can move so quickly in
那样你有希望可以快速发展
that by the time they decide to attack it
到了巨头们决定入局的时候
they're better to acquire you

这样无论你做了什么
once they enter
即使他们进入该市场
will still be meaningful

Very similar to the case study
我给你一个类似的案例
I'll give you a great one.

They found their niches.
康柏电脑找到他们的细分市场
They found their product fit

and they teamed up with their competition.
更是和他们的竞争对手抱团合作
I think if you want to spend some time on Google or whatever search engine you'd like
你可以花些时间上谷歌或者其它搜索引擎
to look at the Compaq Computer story of how they were able to navigate and grow to such a ...
好好看看康柏电脑的发展过程
That is a perfect story
这个案例太完美了
and we see it every day.
而类似的事情也每天都在发生
It's speed.
一定要速度
Only speed
只有速度
trumps somebody that's bigger than a giant
才有可能战胜行业超级巨头
Play your game, and so find niches and go extremely fast.
发挥你的优势，找到细分市场然后狂速推进
Otherwise you have no shot.
不然的话你没机会的

Can you give me some suggestions?
您能给我一些建议吗？

- This is like 90%...90% of the students don't know what to do...

I mean look.
其实
The good news is 90% of all students don't know what to do

如果你不能在短期内获得成功
if you're not succeeding in the short-term
人们就会开始对你指指点点

Can you give us a suggestion on how we should think?

Thank you very much!
非常感谢！
-  You're welcome very much.
-  不客气
1996年
eBay was around
eBay出现了
Amazon was around
亚马逊也出现了
The world hadn't accepted its upside
但是在线购物还没有被大众所接受
I bet on consumer behavior
and innovation
and things changing
我在消费者行为上赌了一把，形势也慢慢改变了
so I didn't predict the future
所以我并没有预测未来
Were there five?
当时在美国有没有五家
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
一、二、三、四、五
Were there are 5 liquor stores in America
that had online stores when I launched?当时我开始做电商的时候在美国有没有5家酒商开了网店？
No.
没有
So it feels like I'm predicting the future
所以看起来像是我预测了未来
but I'm taking innovation that's happening around me
但实际上我只是利用了当时已有的新模式
and I'm deploying it against my own reality at that time
并且把它跟我的实际情况相结合
My bet was that we would pick convenience over history
我当时赌定消费者会因为方便性而放弃传统
Because that's what humans always do
因为人们一直以来都是这样做的
and that's why it was so obvious
这个趋势那么明显也是因为如此
It'd be the same reason that I know that AI is going to be very important
我觉得人工智能很有前景也是这个原因
It's the same reason that I know voice is very important.
语音服务行业也是一样
All the things, my friend,
所有事物的未来
about the future
我的朋友
are happening right now
其实都已经在发生
The question is
关键在于
"Have you calibrated how big they're going to be in
你是否看到了他们在未来的7到10年里
7 to 10 years
发展潜力有多大？
and are you looking the other way while it's right in your face?"
还有你是不是还对此熟视无睹？
I've been very good at understanding
20年来我一直都很擅长于
the arbitrages of attention
理解大众关注度背后的商机
and infrastructure that drive business over the last 20 years
以及驱动商业发展的技术基础
and I plan on doing it for the next 50 years of my life
接下来50年我还打算继续这么做
So for me
所以对于我个人来说
I'm giving it to you right now
我现在就说给你听
Whether it's using KOLs to drive your business
不管是利用网红促进销售
whatever it may be,  right?
还是其它的什么新模式
There are so many opportunities out there
that are so black-and-white obvious
外面的这些机会就如白纸黑字那么明显
Yet, we tend to look the other way
然而很多人还是选择视而不见
because there's no historical reference point
因为不存在所谓的历史参照
directly to that attribution
可以直接进行对比
But there is
但其实也还是有的
Celebrities have been selling products for a 100 years
利用名人效应做商业宣传已经存在了100年
They are just new celebrities, got it?
网红就新一代的名人，明白吗？
So my punchline is very simply
所以我的理念很简单
The future is always the present
未来就是现在
Right?
不是吗
If you're guessing the future, you're guessing
如果你只是猜测未来，你就只是在猜想
If you're moving quickly in the reality
如果你对现实快速做出反应
it seems like you're predicting
虽然看起来你是在预测
but you're just reacting
但其实你只是在快速反应而已
You like that one, right? That was a good one.
你喜欢这个答案对吧？确实不错
-So cool
-真厉害
- Can we ask one?
- 我们能提一个问题吗？
- Yeah, of course!
- 当然可以!
Was that it for them?
他们的问题就这些？
OK, Go ahead, you get to ask one.
行，你可以提一个问题
- My question is
- 我的问题是
In China, Alipay, WeChat, Google payments...
在中国，支付宝，微信钱包还有谷歌钱包等等
are in the trillions
都是万亿级的市场规模
In the U.S., only $60 billion maybe from mobile payments...
而在美国，移动支付应该只有600亿这样...
- Because there's fragmentation.
-因为美国市场分工比较细
So go ahead, what's it going to take?
所以你的问题是，美国移动支付的发展会怎样？
- I'm saying, why is the U.S. lagging behind?
-我是说，为什么美国在这个领域落后那么多？
-  The reason the U.S. is lagging behind
-  美国之所以在移动支付领域发展滞后
is because the giant internet companies in China are fully integrated
是因为在中国的互联网公司巨头的整合程度非常高
If Apple and Facebook merged tomorrow
如果苹果和脸书明天合并了
you'd have it
那么美国的移动支付规模就起来了
The end
就这么回事
I mean, it's it's just the dynamics
我的意思是，这只是市场的动态变化
Look
你看
there's one thing that people give credit to the Chinese entrepreneurs人们在谈论中国企业家的成功的时候
that isn't taken into account
往往忽略了一个因素
which is the government involvement matters
那就是政府的参与
That's not how the U.S. works
美国就不是这样的
You know... like ...you know 就比如
Steve jobs wasn't able to call
当年乔布斯也不可能
at the time, George Bush and say,
给小布什打电话说
"You know that Facebook thing that's emerging.“你看facebook这发展势头这么猛
Yeah, I need I that."
对，我想收购它。”
I love when...
我喜欢...
Listen, as you can see你也知道
my energy so pro-Asia, plenty pro-China
我很看好亚洲和中国市场
But we can't forget that但是我们无法忽视
the big dogs had competitive government advantages很多巨头公司凭借政府优势
that created a full stack
成就了很多
In the U.S., it's called Apple, Amazon, and Facebook
在美国，我们有苹果，亚马逊和Facebook
In China, it's just all integrated
在中国，这些都被整合在一起了
Yeah.
没错
Is there one more?
还有吗？
- Actually there's one question from the guy who just left.
- 刚离开的小伙子有个问题
-Ok
-可以
-Darren
I think we should do it for him
我觉得我们应该替他提问
- Yeah, why don't you ask one. I think we're good
- 行，你也可以提问的
- Actually, the one that I prepared, I asked back in the event
- 我准备的那个问题在会上提过了
- Oh you did...right right ok good
-  While we're hanging out here having a good time...
-  趁现在我们聚一起探讨问题，也都很开心...
What you're seeing, what you're vibing
你们在这里所看到的，感受到的
is just a very thoughtful, exciting moment in my career
就是我的职业生涯里一个经过深思熟虑的，激动人心的时刻
To me
对我来说
looking at the Asian market is almost as
亚洲市场让我满怀希望而且激动不已
wide open and as exciting as when I started Vaynermedia
就跟我当时我创立范纳媒体
or when I started to get involved my Dad's business with Wine Library
接手我爸的葡萄酒生意WineLibrary
or when I discovered the internet
发现互联网
or when social media Web 2.0 was emerging
from the Web 1.0 era
还有Web1.0时代转变到社交媒体Web2.0时代的时候一样
You've got a question?
你有问题要问吗？

Punchline being
总而言之
this expansion into the Asian market
对亚洲市场的拓展
both in Mainland China and surrounding marketplaces
包括中国大陆和周边的一系列市场
is going to be a really fun frontier
将会非常有意思
Go ahead
开始吧
- So this question is from Darren
- 这个问题来自Darren
He asked about "How does one start a process of architecting one's business?"
他问“应该如何构建一项生意？”
and "When you are architecting your own business
还有“在你进行商业构建的时候，
how do you gain support for an unpopular decision?"
你如何为你的小众决策争取支持？”
"How do you convince your team to work on it?"
“你怎么说服你的团队去执行它？”
-  Yeah. So you convince your team by one of two things
-  说服你的团队有两种方式
Either motivating them through enormous optimism
要不就是通过极致的乐观主义来鼓励他们
or forcing them through dark dictatorship
要不就是通过黑暗的独裁统治
The middle one --
中间那个问题稍后回答
The first one is
第一个问题的答案是
how you begin to architect is backwards
对生意的构建方法就是逆推
You try to figure out what you're doing backwards
通过逆推的方法来决定你需要做什么
You try to figure out why you're doing it
首先要明白你做这件事的意义是什么
and what the opportunity is
有哪些机会
and then once you understand
当你搞清楚这些之后
-- So for me, when I started Vaynermedia
用我的例子来说，我刚开始创立范纳媒体的时候
Oh my God
我的天啊
Oh, wow
哦，你看
there's a lot of reasons why the biggest companies in the world世界上很多大公司的营销推广做得不伦不类的
don't market properly
为什么呢
They're not smart enough?
因为他们不够聪明？
Not really
不是
They don't care?
他们不在乎吗？
Kind of
有点
But wait a minute
等等！
There are four major marketing companies that dictate the entire world
有四个主流的营销公司垄断了整个行业
and they're pushing the profitable items for themselves
他们为了自己的利益不断推出高盈利的产品
And there's not a lot of talent that sees where the world is going
而且基本没有谁看得到市场营销领域的未来趋势
What if I built a machine
要不我就打造一部机器
that was so incredible at marketing
市场推广做的比谁都强
that then when I bought brands in the future
然后当我以后买进一些品牌
and I ran it through them
再利用我的机器进行推广
I could take the value of a brand
我能把品牌的价值
like K-Swiss
像K-Swiss之类的品牌
from $100 to $500 million in sales very quickly
很快地使销售额从1个亿增长到5个亿
because I only did KO... influencer marketing
因为我只做网红营销
I only did Facebook

I only did blahblahblahblah
我专注于...
OK. Why don't I do that?
没错，为什么不呢？
OK. Now
行，现在
the way I'm going to do that is
实现这个目标的方式就是
I'm going to build an agency打造一家营销代理公司，

It won't be popular at first
在一开始肯定不受欢迎
but I have to do it
