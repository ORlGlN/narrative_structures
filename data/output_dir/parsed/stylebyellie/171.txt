- (bright uptempo music)
-  Hello everyone.
Welcome to our beautiful
island, Castaway Key.
In a few minutes,
we will be arriving in
our final destination.
- Jackson, do you know where we are?
- At the ocean.
- We're at the ocean.
We're at Castaway Key,
the last stop before we go home.
What do you think we
should do first today?
- Go swimming.
- Let's go swimming.
- With my goggles on.
- Let's do that.
Did you find a seashell already?
We haven't even been here 10 minutes.
- This is for me?
- Yeah.
(bright uptempo music)
- I'm gonna try and push up underwater.
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.
(underwater bubbles)
-  Hello.
- Hello.
Hey Jackson, put your goggles on.
- Hello.
- One two three, woo!
(laughing)
(bright music)
(yells)
- Castaway Key was amazing
and I think that the kids had a blast.
And that is what I want.
I want the kids to have a lot of fun
and they have.
But you can't leave a vacation
without some souvenirs.
And the other day I picked
up a handful of these mugs.
I thought they looked very
cute and sweet and classic.
My parents, I believe
I have the story right,
on their anniversary, they
had gone to Disneyland,
or sometime they had gone to Disneyland
and they bought 20 of these Disney mugs,
and I didn't ever appreciate them,
but now that I look back,
they are so classic
and I'll try and have a picture posted,
(bell dings)
because they are beautiful.
But I grabbed a handful of these mugs,
so we have some mugs
to drink hot chocolate
in the fall.
It's October 1st soon,
and when you guys see this,
it'll be past October 1st,
I can't believe it.
And we got the boys some shirts.
Jared saw the Nemo shirts,
and we had to get the
boys matching shirts,
and then that's Calvin's.
-  Go show Mom.
Okay, go show her.
- Mom!
- What did she make you?
- A heart magic wand.
- A heart magic wand.
You got to meet her?
- Yeah.
- Was that cooL?
- I made if for you.
- Oh my heart, thank you.
Are we gonna watch Mickey Mouse
do a dance party soon?
- Yes.
Where's Calvin?
- He's right here.
- He's right here.
-  Awww.
- I do hate that they're separate.
So it's fun when they see each other.
Look, Jackson gave that to me.
Tinkerbelle helped you, huh?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
(bright upbeat music)
(signal tone)
- Hi guys future Jared
coming in here real quick
just to tell you a little
bit about this time lapse.
If you notice in the
freeze frame right now,
you'll see all of the
cast members on the dock
are actually bowing.
And this was such a cool moment.
Whenever we would leave a port,
a good amount of people
would be on the outside
of the ship, watching as we leave.
But on this particular
day at Castaway Key,
nearly everyone was on
the outside of the ship,
watching us depart from the port.
And it was very very cool to
see all of those cast members
down there, waving to
us with Mickey hands.
And then they bowed.
And it was this cool moment,
and everyone on the ship
cheered that could see them.
And it was the coolest thing,
and I wish I wasn't doing a time lapse,
I wish I was just doing an actual video,
so you could hear that.
But I wanted to pop in and tell you that,
because it was really
really cool to see that
and to hear that.
All of the roaring applause
for these cast members.
And it made it feel like a good departure
of the cruise as well.
(signal tone)
(bright music)
- We are getting ready
for the Mickey Mouse
character dance party!
Everyone's starting to dance already,
especially your brother.
-  He's killin' it.
Yeah.
Wow.
(bright music)
(bright music)
Whoa!
- Chip and Dale totally
butt-pushed Calvin.
It was funny.
- Bye!
(cheering)
- Three.
- Three.
- Four.
Okay, let's do it together.
One
two.
One
two.
- When I picked Jackson
up at the kids' club,
he said, I did so many things,
I don't even want to tell you about it.
He had so much fun at the kids club,
because every time we came to pick him up
I'm like what did you do, what did you do?
And I think today he was like,
I did so much.
They're doing something
special for dinner tonight.
So Ashley and Calvin has
been drawing Calvin's,
and then everyone has to
draw in the white line.
We may have to give
you mine and you do it,
because we can't draw out
of the white line, okay?
(Ellie laughs)
Now draw a big smiley face.
-  Yeah.
- Can you draw the shirt
inside the white line?
Perfect.
- Perfect.
-  There you go.
I think my character's really really happy
to be alive right now.
You know, don't you think?
He's just happy to be alive.
- That's so true.
-  His hands, I'm
not sure about that though.
-  His eyes, I look over,
yep yep, they're out.
He was literally watching the iPad,
and it was like oh yep, he's out.
Aww, he's gonna miss dinner.
Extra dessert.
They're gonna show your drawing
up on the screen for everyone to see.
- A colorful entrance (laughs).
Oh hiya folks.
Gosh, thanks for all
of the great drawings.
These are just what I need to whip up
a little animation magic.
(laughs)
-  Only at Disney, will you insist
on making a bed for our child.
Only at Disney.
Thank you.
We said no, but they kind of insisted.
- Only at Disney, you know,
only at Disney.
(Ellie laughs)
-  They even made a pillow for him.
And there's a block right here,
so he can't fall off.
Thank you guys, thank you.
- My pleasure.
-  Thank you.
And wait for it, wait for it,
and he's out too.
Aww man, the show hasn't even started yet.
- He's so tired.
(Jared laughs)
(magical music)
-  Oh that's mine right there!
There's mine, Ellie.
There's Mom.
(clapping)
Yeah!
(enchanting music)
(stopwatch ticking)
(signal tone)
We just had our last dinner
with all the people that we
have been enjoying dinner with.
Our server Ashley, his partner Diogo,
our friends Allison and Ken,
and it was just awesome.
I've been telling everyone
that I've been talking to,
on board, all of the cast members that
it's really hard to describe exactly
how I felt about this cruise,
because I just don't think magical
really expresses the way that I feel.
Magical is the word,
but I just feel like there's enough
power behind that word.
It is magical,
and we had such a great time.
The cast members here, I was like,
are we getting special service,
because everyone here has been so amazing,
and Allison and Ken, who actually work
for Disney Cruise Lines, they were like,
no that's just how everyone is here,
and I was like holy crap,
this has been amazing.
- Like when Calvin fell asleep.
- When Calvin fell asleep, exactly,
and they made a bed for him
so I could eat dinner.
- It's been a very innocent week.
-  Yeah.
- It's been so
I think my favorite thing this week
was dancing with the characters.
-  Oh yeah, the dance party.
- The boys loved it.
Calvin and Jackson were
on cloud 10 dancing
with Mickey and Pluto.
And I loved it.
That was like one of my favorite parts.
- Absolutely.
We've had so many fun parts of this trip.
I can't even put a finger on exactly one.
The variety shows, the Broadways shows,
the ports
- The Broadway shows at night.
-  Yeah.
-  The kids,
when they stayed up late
and watched those, loved the shows.
- We are just packing up
and I'm just trying to
think of the best way
to describe it.
And magical, I mean it
was just magical for us,
magical for the kids,
and I think that's the
cool thing about it,
is Ellie and I are adults,
Jackson and Calvin are
two and three years old
and they had a magical time too.
This is one of the best trips
that we have ever gone on with our family.
I told Ellie, I said
this is the best vacation
we have ever been on.
So definitely consider a Disney cruise
for one of your family vacations.
- This has definitely been refreshing.
We have decided to turn off our phones
and just be here,
and that has been amazing, as well.
- Absolutely,
and I think that's one thing that,
this is the first time we've done this
since we started daily vlogs
and I think it's nice
to be able to have this,
and so I think, not all of the time,
but this is something that we may do,
something like this just like
an unplug session, to just
-  Once in a while.
- Goosfraba every once in a while, so.
(howling)
(laughing)
- Mecham family vacation,
(howling)
And this is kind of how
a lot of our nights went.
- We're watching Peter Pan.
- Yes, we are, we would
have a little movie playing
for the kids, because
they have every single
Disney movie in the whole
entire world on these TVs.
We're just having a little
snack before dinner.
- And Jared always goes
to this certain place
to get his pizza because it's thin crust
and it's so good.
-  It's so stinking good.
- This is our night routine.
- Yeah, our night routine, it's so fun.
And I love this.
This is like a memory
that we'll have forever,
is us sitting here eating pizza
watching a Disney movie.
- Late.
- Yeah late at night.
Way past your bedtime (kisses).
Way past your bedtime (kisses).
Did you guys have so
much fun on this cruise?
Yeah?
Did you have so much fun on the cruise?
Yeah?
- You know what, I want
to stay on here forever.
- Oh it was that much fun, huh?
That was our trip.
That was our vacation.
- Back to reality.
- Back to reality.
- Smack into force gravity.
- Oh there goes gravity,
something about Mom's spaghetti.
Okay, we will see you guys next time.
Thank you so much for
watching our wonderful
Disney cruise vacation.
It was magical.
Say goodnight nose picker.
Say bye bye.
- Bye.
- One two three.
(howling)
- And that's a wrap on
the Mecham vacation.
- Yay, bye.
