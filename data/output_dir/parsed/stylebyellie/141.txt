- Alright, we have our favorite beverages.
- Cheers!
So today--
- You gotta drink it!
- Oh, sorry, that's the
whole point of cheers.
Let's try it again.
(both) Cheers.
(exhales)
(laughing)
It's been two years, over two years,
since we started planning to buy a house.
And now we have lived in
here for over one year.
That just boggles my mind.
- It went fast.
- Yeah, it's crazy.
So we wanted to do a Q
and A about the house,
the building process, and the
things that go along with it,
and so a few days ago, well
I guess by now, a while ago,
we asked you to ask us
questions about the house
and we're gonna answer them.
- Totally.
We tried to answer
questions along the way.
I filmed several videos
on my channel kind of,
the fun process of us
picking out tile and carpet
and so this will be nice to,
now that we've been in the
house, to answer some questions.
- We'll have that playlist linked
in the description down below.
It's all on Ellie's channel.
Can we just note real quick,
you're sitting on your
feet, so I'm gonna try--
- And I'm kinda slouching, but
I just wanna be comfortable.
- I'm just tryin' to be a
little bit taller than you--
- Is that okay?
It's cold in here.
(mumbling)
So what the first question is,
I love your house, thank you,
I love the layout and
how you've decorated it.
When I followed the building process,
I remember being surprised how much wood
they used to build it.
Is it normal to build like that in Utah
or did you choose a wood house?
Love your vlogs, from Nina from Denmark.
- Well, that's actually a
question that we got a ton
during the building process.
We answered it a few
times in the comments,
but just to kinda go over it,
depending on where you live in the world,
depending on the climate,
there's different building processes.
I am not a foreman.
I'm not a construction
worker so I don't know
all of the details with it, but,
for example, in California,
you're roofing material
is different than here in Utah.
But for the most part, the
climate that we live in,
most of the houses in
Utah, Washington, Idaho,
are built from wood mostly.
- Yep, that was very normal and so when we
would see those comments,
I think it opened our eyes
to be like, we do have
a very wide audience
that's all over the world.
This is so foreign to some people,
when it was so normal to us, you know?
- I mean, some houses
are made out of brick.
You'll drive down the road
and you'll see brick houses,
but for the most part, it's wood.
And I think that's just
more cost-effective.
We don't have a lot of
wildfires here in Utah,
so I don't think that's a huge concern.
And I know that's something
that people brought up too.
So our next question is,
Are you planning on doing something else
with the playroom when the kids grow up?
The option is there to
do something different.
So that wall opposite of the kids' room,
where we have shelving,
is actually plumbed for a kitchenette.
We didn't want the kitchenette
while the kids were there
because we didn't want
them playing with water
or anything while they're
playing downstairs.
So it's plumbed for it, so
when the kids are older,
we can have a kitchenette there,
kind of like a half kitchen.
- Maybe get a foosball table?
- Yeah, just have it more
of like an adult playroom?
- Yeah.
- Does that sound appropriate?
- Yeah, totally.
Somethin' for the teenagers to play in.
Yeah, and for us.
But I think eventually we'll even take out
that wall space that has
all of the kids' toys in it
in years to come and it--
- The shelving?
- Yeah and be just a fun,
I mean it already is
a fun open area as is,
but just to give us even more space,
we could put a few--
- Like a ping pong table?
- Yeah!
- Do you remember that?
- I think people gave me
a lot of crap for that
because they thought I was saying no.
- Yeah.
- You always put that on me!
- I did, and I feel terrible about that.
- We can get a stupid ping pong table!
- We can get a ping pong table.
It just doesn't make sense
when the kids are that little, to do it.
'Cause that's their play area.
- I just don't know if
we'd play with it tons.
- Yeah, I would, but (laughs).
- We can get a ping pong table!
- I am giving her a hard time.
Please don't give her one too.
- Who did your painting,
your extra large painting
in the living room upstairs?
That was my friend that
lives in the neighborhood
and her name is ChelsMade on Instagram.
And I will have her in the description.
- Super talented artist.
- Love her!
She's my really good friend.
What special tweaks
did you add to the home
that you never use?
- Well, I mean, that
secret room in the attic,
did we tell them about that?
I'm kidding, no we didn't do anything.
Because we made it the way that we wanted,
we've used everything.
Like the half-wall in our bathroom,
the toilet in the laundry room,
which I guess it's controversial (laughs).
- Yeah, that was interesting.
- Which is totally normal for everyone--
- Here.
- Here, yeah.
- The things that we tweaked
is pretty much what we use.
I guess the one thing
maybe we don't use as much
is in our pantry, I had
that little half-wall.
But I like it because it still holds
my mixers and everything.
So I would say we don't use that space.
I thought I would go in and use stuff,
which I do with the toaster, but--
- It's not like a preparation
area like you thought.
It's mostly just like a storage area.
- I never thought I was gonna prep there.
And a lot of people
were like, That's silly.
But I never said I was gonna prep there.
It was just to hold cooking pans
if tons of people came over.
Yeah, it does that.
- So maybe that's the spot.
- I guess.
- What was the hardest part
about building your house?
And what is your favorite room in it?
So the hardest part, for me, anyway,
and it's not something that I really had
a ton of control with,
is making sure that the
different contractors
did their job on schedule.
We got pushed back a little
bit, due to weather, I mean,
things that happen.
- Normal stuff.
- And we understand,
I would say that was the hardest part
is because when it was getting
into winter time, or October,
we were like, Okay, we
may be able to get grass
if we're a week or two
early than we are now,
which is still behind schedule.
I think that was the hardest part for me.
- And hearing a lot of people that build,
which is totally normal, but I do think
that's hard for the other people as well
because they're just so excited.
- Absolutely.
- My neighbor, she just moved in,
but it took them about four
months longer than they thought
and that was due to weather, materials,
so kinda stuff that's
out of your hands anyway,
but just, it's hard on your family.
She has a family of five, so.
- These things happen and
they're to be expected,
but it doesn't mean they're not difficult.
- I think the hardest part for me was,
it was just one incident,
and it was one contractor,
I was just trying to convey what I wanted
and them having a hard time
picturing what I wanted.
Like how the layout would
be of tile, or something.
That was the hard part for me.
But other than that, the communication
was actually pretty smooth for
us and I really enjoyed that.
Alright, what is your favorite room?
- Oooh.
I mean, obviously I have a
special place in my heart
for my office, because I
spend so much time in there.
But really, when you walk into the house
and you just see the
living room and the kitchen
and the dining, the great room.
I think that's my favorite.
- I would say the room that
I spend the most time in,
aside from the kitchen,
is definitely our bedroom.
I think one of the kids'
favorite rooms as well.
They each have toys in their room.
But I have a little bit of toys in my room
that they play with and
I like cuddling in bed
and watching shows with them.
The tub, the kids love
taking baths in my big tub.
So I would say my bedroom
is probably my favorite spot
in the room, (correcting self) house.
- This question is for
the house and Penny, ooh!
How are the floors holding
up having a big dog
like a lab in the house running all over.
Do they get scratched
or messed up a bunch?
Well, so that's, it's
funny that you ask that
because we just spoke with the person
who did our hardwood
floors and we're noticing
that the coating is just not holding up
the way that we wanted it to.
There's some splits down the lines.
And I'm not sure if that's to
say because of Penny solely.
But I think that has,
definitely, some part to it.
You know that we take off
our shoes in our house
so I feel like we're not that
crazy with the hardwood floors
but we're definitely ready for a new seal.
So we're gonna be doing that as soon
as we get back from our trip, actually.
- Yeah, with Penny, with
the wood floors though,
there are definitely scratches on them.
We have some protectors
that protect the bar stools
from sliding, so it's smooth.
- Same with the couches.
- Same with the couches,
but there's definitely
scratches from Penny's nails.
And I think, honestly,
it's not really Penny
that has scratched them up as much.
I think the hardest thing
that happened with the house
was when we, we weren't able
to get the yard in first.
And so there was a lot
of dirt and mud and snow
and even rock that was in
the house in the winter
and then along having
a dog running around.
That kinda scratched up
the floors quite a bit.
So I think that's where most
of the damage has come from,
was just not from a finished yard,
lots of dirt, lots of coming in and out.
So we are gonna get it
sanded and resealed,
though, this month.
- Which I think will be really nice.
Smooth sealing.
- Oh yeah.
- What is your favorite memory
in the new house from the past year?
- I would have to say Christmas.
Because I've always kind of envisioned
just my own family in my home,
and it was really special and romantic.
- It's a bucket list
dream come true experience
that you get to have.
Mine is very similar.
Same timeline.
I think one of my favorite
memories is when we got Penny.
- Aww, yes.
Made our house a home.
- That was very sweet.
Yeah exactly.
- You guys wanna come in?
- Do you wanna come in?
- (mimicking) Yeah.
- Alright, this next
question, I'm not gonna go
into huge details because I
already have a video on it,
but it talks about what
it was like working
with the contractor and builders?
Did you search awhile to find one?
We knew what builder we wanted,
but we also interviewed about five,
four or five other builders
before we settled with one.
That way we felt the communication,
each building process has
different price ranges,
so yeah.
But I do have a video
specifically on that.
And we really enjoyed working with
the contractors and the builder.
I think that they respected
us and we respected them
and it was a very, very smooth process.
- Absolutely.
Do you think it's more,
less, or equally as expensive
to build a house rather
than to buy a house?
So with us,
whoa.
With us and our situation,
we actually looked at that.
Yeah, where we live, that's
a huge factor into the cost
of housing, is where you live.
Housing is not terribly expensive in Utah.
So when we looked into building,
we looked at buying houses
and building houses.
The cost was not that different.
It was very similar to build
a house or buy a house.
So we thought why not build a house
if it's gonna be about the same
and we'll get exactly what we want.
- Yeah, we did find a
house that we really loved.
The back yard was beautiful,
the setup of the house was
fairly similar to this.
- The neighborhood was amazing.
- We really liked it
and we were very close
to putting an offer on it,
but it was a little further
away than we wanted it to be.
And the price was very similar to this.
(cute babbling)
And we thought that it
would just be fun as well,
to build, and to have that experience.
- Absolutely.
- So that's why we ended
up choosing building.
And I like it--
- I would never go back.
(cute babbling)
- What was the easiest part
of designing your own home?
- It was easy because
we went to the builder,
we said we want an open
concept, we need an office,
we need at least three or four bedrooms,
and he pulled up 10 house plans
and he said, Well I like
this and I like this,
this is a newer house plan,
I think you'll like this the most.
We looked at it, we went
and looked at the house
that he built that house plan on
and I was like, Yeah I love it.
So that, I mean it was really easy.
It's not like we started from scratch
and really laid out the house
ourselves with a contractor.
He just had house plans.
- He had house plans
that looked really nice.
- And that's how all the
builders that we interviewed,
how it was, you could do your own.
- But they have floor plans
that you can choose from
just to make it easier.
(babbling)
- Are there any more rooms
or spaces in the house
that you thought you would've
used more but haven't?
Definitely, a lot of the
space we haven't fully used
because we're still a young family.
We haven't quite grown into the house.
But I would definitely say
space we don't use as much,
Oh heavens no! (laughing)
- I'm trying to get him to cheers with me.
- (laughing) Oh!
I thought you were giving him that.
- Cheers.
- But a space that we don't use
as much as I thought we would
is actually the basement.
- Yeah.
- The play area.
I felt like we would be down there more.
We definitely use it,
but the kids really like to
still be by Jared and I a lot,
and so they're often upstairs with us.
If I'm in the kitchen, the
kids are with me cookin'.
If I'm getting ready, the
kids are in my bathroom.
- They just like us
and I'm not sure why.
- I don't know why!
(laughing)
- Yeah, so they like to follow us around.
- Why do you like me?
(babbling)
It's 'cause I give you chocolate milk?
- Yeah!
- Oh!
- That's a pretty good reason.
Were there any ideas that
you had for the house
that you really wanted but
didn't make the cut in the end?
- There was a few things
that would've been fun,
but wasn't a necessity.
We thought about doing some
water features in the back
because we do have a lot of rock work.
The price of water features--
- They're expensive.
- Are even more expensive than,
I mean the rock work alone
can be really expensive,
bringing in rocks, so we
decided not to do that.
Even, we even thought about maybe building
a space for me to cut the boys' hair.
You know, a sink, and I
wish we would have done it,
in a way, 'cause it would
have been very convenient.
- But it hasn't been like,
Oh I really wish we would've had this.
- But we don't, we haven't,
it's been okay not having
a sink to cut their hair.
So they would've been fun,
but those are things we just,
didn't make the cut.
How did you guys start
saving for your house?
I am still in college.
- So, what we did,
and from the beginning of our marriage,
we've always had a budget
and we stick to that budget
as much as we possibly can.
So we have a car fund,
we have a house fund,
and every month that we--
- We have a clothing fund.
- Yeah, all these different categories.
It's like the envelope
system, so it's very similar.
- But in our bank.
We don't really do the
envelope cash system.
- Yeah, we do it within our bank.
But every month we got paid,
we put some money into the car fund
and we put some money into the house fund,
and then once we got to the point
where we could put a down
payment on the lot, the house,
that's what we did.
And some months, those
envelopes got different amounts.
Some months we only put
20 bucks in that folder,
but as much as we could, we did.
And it got to the point where we,
when we moved to where we are,
the city where we are now,
we wanted to get a home,
but we weren't ready for it.
So we actually waited another year,
saved up a little bit more
to do, to what we did.
- To kind of look for the area too,
that took a minute.
- Yeah, takes some time.
- Was there one issue or fight
y'all had about the design of the house
during the building or decorating process?
I would say, for the most part...
- No.
- We pretty much agreed on everything.
I mean there is, of course,
things where it's like,
No I really like that or I like that
but it wasn't a drug out fight of like,
No I wanted that!
- It's gonna be this way or no way.
- Yeah and honestly this
goes into a bigger picture.
From the very beginning when
Jared and I got married,
we talked about money,
finances, sex, kids, church
before we got married.
And then we got married and we talked
about our goals and plans.
Every time we have something,
we really try hard to talk
about it before it even happens.
Like right now, we've talked
about disciplining our kids
before we had kids, so that
we were on the same page.
- We made the decisions
before we got to the question,
if that makes sense.
So we knew what we wanted in
the house, in the designs,
before we even got to the design part.
Then there were some finite details like,
well there's this small change
here, small change there,
but in the great scheme of things,
well that, the whole
design is what we wanted
so it made it easy.
- Yeah.
And that is something that, I think,
could help a lot of people out.
And that's definitely not us
being smart, young kids at the time.
Our parents had a huge impact
on that by teaching us.
But I think that really does help
in every type of relationship.
Just expectations, talk about
things before they happen,
and I think that goes a long way.
- Question about the house,
is it energy efficient?
Does it keep you warm when you need it
and cool when you need it?
- Yes, and I think that has part to do,
we have a Smart thermostat.
So it gives us a good range
to keep the house between,
so it's not always
cooling or always heating.
It does a good job.
And I've actually noticed our energy bill
has gone down quite a bit
just by installing that.
- Yeah.
I talked to Bonnie the other night
'cause she had spent the
night and she was like,
Your house is very well insulated.
And it's a newer home,
so I do think it does
stay warmer when it needs to, and cooler,
because of the way it's
insulated 'cause it's newer.
She just talked about how
her home isn't quite that way
'cause it's a little older.
So I think just because
it is newer, it does.
- Keep the temperature.
I might be wrong, but
there's a second story
"nook" thing above your
house, above your office.
I've wondered about it
since you started building.
Does it have a purpose?
So that is my secret room that I mentioned
earlier in the video.
I don't show the inside of it.
I don't want anyone to
see what goes in there
because it's very private
video game playing.
I mean, shoot!
I've given away too much.
No, it's just aesthetics.
The windows are blacked out.
It's just the attic, is really what it is.
- And I've never been in the attic.
You went in there--
- I did.
- And Jackson went in there.
I've never been in the attic.
- What made you decide to live
in Utah other than family?
Thank you for sharing your daily life.
Awe, thank you so much.
Honestly, family has had
a huge factor into that.
Lots of my side of the family
and Ellie's side of the
family lives in Utah,
so we can't just let that go
and say the family hasn't had a big part.
It has.
- Yeah, I would definitely say so.
And I think the living.
I think it's a good price to live here.
I think if it wasn't here, I
think Texas is a good place.
There's places that we've
visited that we've been like,
we could totally see
ourselves living here.
But then, every time we come back,
there's something about the
Utah mountains that keep us.
It just feels like home.
I dunno.
Maybe one day we'll go crazy and just say
let's pack up and go.
- To New Zealand.
Done, 'kay.
- We want to visit there.
We will.
We have places we want to
visit, but still young family.
We've been lots of places.
- Yes we have.
It's been a blessing.
- Are you using the dog wash area
as much as you thought you would?
- I would say yes.
I mean, I use it for more
than just the dog wash.
And that's kind of a purpose.
It's just like, when we
get muddy and everything,
that's where we take our
boots and spray 'em off.
So yeah.
And the little hose
thing that we have there
has been really nice to have.
- It's been more used for not the dog.
(laughing)
We've used it for a car, carpets,
we've used it for the kids
when Jared goes four-wheeling,
muddy boots, and we've
used it quite a bit.
I thought we would use
it more for the dog.
I thought it was gonna be
built a little differently.
And this is something that we could,
we are planning on doing, is having it be
more of an enclosed area.
Because water splashes
all over the cabinet.
So that was hard when we
had bathed Penny in there.
So I definitely know that that's
something that we wanna do,
probably this year, is--
- Gotta build it up a little more.
- Yeah, have some walls on it.
But it has been used.
Not the purpose we thought as much.
- Yeah.
- Penny's probably showered
in our shower more.
- More than (laughs).
Well that is our house Q and A.
We've loved being here for the year.
We've learned a lot.
And hopefully we've been able to show you
some of that with these questions.
Thank you so much for taking
the time to ask these questions
- And to watch.
- And to watch and that is
gonna be it from us today.
So thank you so much for watching.
See you tomorrow, bye!
