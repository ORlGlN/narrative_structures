little handkerchief YouTube magic but
look how cute that is it's for we need
rules but they're so cute it's like a
little handkerchief I have a question
for you guys
this was on my mind as I was driving
home today from work do you guys ever
have I mean I think this is obvious for
everyone but I just think the whole
phenomenon is crazy like some days feel
like they go way way slow and then other
days feel like they go so so fast and I
want to know like other than like you
know time flies when you're having fun
what is this strange phenomenon that
makes the day feel like it goes by so
much faster than others and some days
feel like they're just dragging on like
no and that that's my thought today I
was just like man like why is the day
going so slow and then I get home crap
why is the day going so fast why is it
going so fast that we can't we just slow
things down a little bit let's take it
down slow
after real real slow
no lo no I said slow
no I'm going oh no slap to the face Oh
Ellie likes to slap my face and she
gives the worst titty twisters I cannot
tell you Elia has liked these pictures
of death and I get bruises really really
bad TMI every time I do it you starts
laughs and he puts his hand is enough so
he stops laughing but he was he was
laughing at the store it's gonna walk
let's go on a walk let's go let's go on
okay yes so I have a question
and this question goes out to everyone
who is everyone who has a licence in the
world one of my I have two huge pet
peeves when it comes to people who are
driving on the road number one pet peeve
people who don't use their blinker when
they change lanes it drives me crazy
like use your blinker like that's that
is there is a design purpose for that
thing in your car to do when you change
lanes and use your blinker just flip the
switch just flip it flip it good second
thing that drives me crazy
is people who tale if you are riding on
my butt and I'm not in the fast lane
what the heck are you doing I'm like
just talking about it first row case
you're at work we want to relax so we'll
drop the conversation I'll make a wish
what is it look at all this beautiful
water especially outside over there I
know we're going a little walk today
this is where we went on that hike do
you guys remember that huge waterfall
that we got on the hike just like me
like a couple weeks ago or something and
I said I can't see it now anyway we're
going on a walk now through the trail
can you feel it can you smell it
peace tranquility relaxation and a hunt
what the heck is that
oh that's a big bathroom
should I go explore it real quick I'm
gonna go explore it real quick what is
this there's like a little window
there's a wall maybe this is Bigfoot's
house oh there's a door and definitely
lost there there so he can get up here
and I can get up here hello down there

so sad
oh I just broke my sunglasses these are
like my favorite sunglasses I got them
at the outlets at Park City they're
normally like 50 bucks but they have
like three sales that were going on and
I got them for $7 sure I'm like so mad
uh I honestly am the worst at keeping
sunglasses I have had like three that
I've gotten and I've really liked and
I've lost them the next day
and so I've had these for like almost
two years and just climbing up this
stupid Hut that you can't even get to I
broke my freaking sunglasses you

with your foot yeah I stepped it I step
behind me and I couldn't see it and I my
foot got all that can I tell you guys
one of my most favorite things to do now
is put Jackson down to bed and seeing
him to sleep I love singing him to sleep
because it's like oh you like my voice
or you second singing so I'm gonna go to
sleep one of those two either one
we benefit cuz Jackson falls asleep and
it's been nice for me because like I get
up with them and I usually put them down
to bed and I'm with them all day so it's
kind of nice
