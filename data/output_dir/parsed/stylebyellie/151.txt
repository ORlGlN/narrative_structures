- We're going to meet our friend Andy.
- I feel like good things
can come from this.
- Do you realize that
you helped save his life,
because he could've died
from crying, literally?
To make him not cry.
They saved his life.
(emotional music)
- And I sticked it in there.
(laughing)
- Good morning, my superheroes.
How are you, today?
- Good.
- Good, you look so good and so strong.
So I want to tell what we're doing today.
We're going to meet our friend Andy.
Andy is about Calvin's age.
He is going to tell us
his story with his family,
and we're going to play with him today.
- Okay.
- Okay, are you excited to play with Andy?
Awesome.
Calvin?
- Is he a kid?
- He's a kid, yeah.
He's like Calvin's age.
- Oh.
- So you'll have a lot
of fun with him, okay?
- Okay.
He looks like Toy Story.
- Yeah, he has the name from Toy Story.
Last year when we did the food drive,
we met a very special
family, Andy's family,
and we met them again
at Vit Summit this year,
me and my dad, and they
told us about Andy's story
in more depth and we are
going to visit them today,
and we are going to talk
to Andy and play with Andy,
and we're going to talk with their family
and we're going to tell you their story.
(emotional music)
So we are here at the Whittaker household.
- Hi!
- We've got everyone back
here, and especially Andy!
Hey bud.
- Andy, say hi!
- Can you say hi?
(laughing)
Andy has been reaching for
the camera all day today.
He loves it.
You like to blog, don't ya?
Do you want to blog for a minute?
Yeah?
- 'Kay.
- 'Kay, say hi guys!
- Hi.
- Hi.
That is so sweet.
Like I mentioned before, we had met Heidi.
- Hi.
- And Emory.
- Hi.
- And Robbie at the food drive
that we did with Ellie's family,
and then we met them again at Vit Summit,
and every time that we've talked to them,
we've talked about Andy.
Andy is a very very special kid.
I'm getting emotional already.
- He just really wants to be,
you want to be the
highlight right now, huh?
(laughs)
- So we were talking about Andy's story.
So we came over to Whittakers' house.
and we want them to share his story.
- I don't need to tell you how
special Ellie and Jared are,
because you already know this,
but to our family they mean so much.
When Andy was born, he was born with a lot
of health challenges, a lot
of problems with breathing.
He was in a lot of pain.
-  Hi buddy.
- Nothing was really
helping him until one day
when my daughter Emory figured out
that if we turned on Ellie and
Jared, he would stop crying
and that he would be okay
while their video was on,
which seemed kind of crazy.
We tried other people's videos,
and it didn't have the same effect.
It was just something
about Ellie and Jared,
and the crying would stop
and the suffering would stop
just during that time,
and so Ellie and Jared
got him through multiple surgeries.
They got him through so many hard times
and kind of our sanity
because it's really hard
to have a baby who screams
24/7 for months at a time.
Meeting them was so incredible
but I really couldn't tell them,
I could never explain to them,
"No, you don't understand.
"You changed our lives.
"You helped this baby so much.
"That there are no words, and
I know you're amazing people,
but you helped this baby so much!"
(laughing)
So I was so grateful for the
chance to just talk to Jared
just for a minute at Vit Summit and say,
"No, Jared. You need to listen!
"Because this baby is really okay,
"because of what you
and Ellie did for him,
"and you didn't even know it."
- When I heard that for the first time,
I mean, my heart just sunk.
My heart just dropped, because
I couldn't believe that.
Something that Ellie and I would just do
every single day would
have such an impact,
but there's more to it than that.
As much as I like to hear that, it's very,
I mean, it's very very humbling.
There's more to it than
just that with Andy.
- I'm Tasha.
I'm Andy's mom.
For months, basically
up until Andy was born
I would have to come
over here during the day
while Robbie went to work,
because I could not take care of myself.
I was in pain.
I was having gallbladder attacks.
I had to rely on everybody
to help take care of me,
because I was 27 weeks pregnant
when I got into the car crash.
-  Well, and even before that,
you had an appendectomy?
- Yeah, when I thought I
was pregnant with Andy,
I was (laughs), we were in the ER.
I was three and a half weeks and
they did the normal blood test
that they do when you go into the ER,
and they came in and they're like,
"Well, everything looks normal,
"but you're pregnant, congratulations."
We're like, "What?"
(laughing)
They did some sort of
scan, and they came back,
and they're like, "You have appendicitis.
"We have to do emergency
surgery or you're going
"to lose the baby, because it will burst."
So the next morning, they took me back
and did the surgery, and
I just remember thinking,
"I am so scared about the surgery,"
because a couple months before that,
we had had a miscarriage and emotionally,
I was still getting past that,
and I was so scared of
losing this baby too,
because of this surgery.
Even from the start, Andy
was such a little fighter.
He made it through and
even from the beginning,
he's gone through so much,
but he still is fighting.
He's such a fighter.
- So when Andy was born, his
mom had been in a car accident,
and for nearly three months,
she needed to be on Percocet.
She was in and out of the hospital.
This was a day to day decision,
because they were trying to decide
between operating on Natasha
while she was seven months pregnant
or trying to ride it out
on prescription drugs,
and we met with pediatric pharmacologists.
I mean, there was a big
decision process made.
Would it be safe to wait?
Would it be harder on the baby?
Would it be harder on Natasha?
And the decision was made to have her be
on Percocet and other opiates
for almost three months
until Andy could be born, and
then to have surgery on her,
but we knew when he was born,
that he would be going
through drug withdrawals.
That's what we were expecting.
What we were not expecting
was him to be born
with really serious birth defects
in his airway and in his jaw.
So after Andy was born,
we found out that he had,
it's a disease called laryngomalacia,
which means there's too much
skin right above his larynx.
It would close in on him, and
it would cut off his airway,
but also because his jaw
was small and misshapen,
it pushed his tongue back all
the way back into his airway,
and so when he would go to sleep,
it was almost like he was
swallowing his tongue.
His tongue would fill
his airway completely,
and he would not be able to breathe.
So we actually had to hold
him in a certain position
to keep his airway open all night long
until we could have surgery.
Or he, until he could have the surgery,
but it was really complicated,
because they took CAT scans of his jaw,
and then they had to send those CAT scans
to a company in Colorado that built
a computer-generated version of his jaw
and showing the doctors exactly
what needed to be done
to reshape it properly
and send those back to Salt Lake City.
So he was actually
hospitalized for quite a while
while we were waiting for the
ability to do surgery on him.
- I remember the day I knew
that he needed the surgery.
This was before he had been admitted,
for weeks before the surgery,
like Heidi was saying.
Fact, I think the next day
was when he was admitted
for about a month beforehand,
and I was sitting there holding him
and we were actually
watching your channel.
I just got this horrible
feeling like my baby was dead,
and I was holding him.
I was watching him.
He was alive.
He was breathing, but it
felt like he was gone,
and
I
literally heard a vocie in my head say,
"If you do not get this surgery,
that is what will happen."
And I called Robbie immediately,
and he said he had just
felt the same thing.
- Told my boss that I felt
like I needed to go home.
He was very supportive
and then two hours later,
we had to call Primary Children's,
and they sent us to the ER
and admitted us that night.
- And we were there for about two weeks
before they had the mandibles
so they could do the surgery.
It was honestly one of
the strongest feelings
I have ever had.
- There's no way to prepare
for what it's going to be like
to have a baby who's going
through drug withdrawal.
They're in pain.
It's like even though it's a mental thing,
they're in physical pain
when they don't have
that drug inside of them.
-  It's awful.
- That's where Emory comes in,
because Emory had heard
about Ellie and Jared
when she went to CVX Live
and fallen in love with them
and had gone back to the very first videos
and had started watching
them from the very beginning
and decided she was
going to lay on the floor
with this newborn baby
and watch Ellie and Jared,
and that's when she figured out
that if she turned on their
videos he would stop screaming.
Just stop, and he would watch,
and he would be all happy.
And as soon as a video was over,
he'd start screaming again,
so she'd turned on the next one.
And then they became a part
of our lives 24 hours a day.
(laughing)
Because babies who are going
through drug withdrawal,
they don't sleep.
They just scream.
So they're our family,
because they live with us all the time.
- They don't know us
but they live with us.
- Whether you want us
to be your roommates or not, we're here.
(laughing)
- There isn't a day that I
don't think about your family.
Not one day that I don't think about you,
that I don't acknowledge the fact
that you're a blessing
in our lives and that,
'cause honestly I don't.
I guess one thing I didn't explain
to you is what happens when he cries,
and maybe this is where you understand
how you helped save his life,
and I mean that sincerely.
A baby with laryngomalacia,
if they cry, they can die,
because when they cry, their
airway gets so occluded,
and it won't come back up again.
So you do everything that you
can to keep them from crying,
which is why they get spoiled,
but you do everything you can to keep them
from crying because it's so dangerous
and when we took him in to see the doctor,
he said, "Don't let him cry."
- And he's a newborn.
- You tell me not to let
a drug addicted baby,
don't let a drug addicted baby cry,
you might as well be saying,
"Hold the tide back,"
because that doesn't happen,
and so for you to come
into his life and make him not cry,
do you realize that you
helped save his life,
because he could've died
from crying, literally?
So for your family to
come on our TV screen
or on the telephone, or on the cell phone,
and to make him not cry,
to make him not cry,
they saved his life, because
his dad used to do that,
and if his dad would cry hard enough,
we'd have to call the
paramedics and resuscitate him.
It's that big of a deal.
- And that was ribs or?
- Yeah, if you were to look at my ribcage,
it's shaped like this, instead
of like a standard ribcage,
just because of how many
times the compressions
that they've done, they're just broken.
- You can feel it just by
putting your hand on his chest.
You can feel that.
-  That's crazy.
Tell me about life right now with Andy.
- It's wonderful and
scary at the same time.
He stops breathing about 27 times a night,
and sometimes it's just
really short periods.
Other times he has to
wake himself up, gasper,
and catch a breath.
He's on oxygen anytime he's asleep.
He wears a cannula all the time,
because you rip it off, it hurts.
- His poor face.
-  His poor face.
- He's had a cannula on
for almost two years now,
and his face is just so--
- Red where the tape marks are
- Red and raw.
We've tried so many different options.
- The thing is with Andy is that
you just have to be in
the right frame of mind,
because you don't know about tomorrow,
and no one knows about
tomorrow with their lives.
Things can happen, but
with him, we don't know
about tomorrow and we've
been told in confidence.
We had one doctor pull
Robbie aside and he said
he didn't believe that the right tests
were being done at that moment.
He didn't agree with what was happening.
He pulled Robbie aside.
He said, he basically said,
"You're up against a time clock
"right now, and you've
gotta get this diagnosed
"before time runs out for him,
"and that hasn't happened yet."
To have someone pull you aside to say,
"I think that there's
something really wrong,
"and I don't think your
baby's going to live
"if you don't really pursue this hard
"and get something done,"
it was a hard thing to take.
- The thing that I asked,
"What's life like now?"
Because you said he still stops
breathing 27 times a night.
Andy's not better yet.
- No, he's not.
- No, and his heart has
become involved now.
So that's the hard thing
is that not only is
his brain not sending the signal
for him to breath at night,
sometimes it doesn't send
the signal for his heart
to beat the way it should,
(baby crying)
so he's not regulating
his heartbeat or his oxygen levels either.
The big concern with
the gene that they think
might be involved is that
his brain just will not tell
his heart to beat one day,
and he just won't wake up.
- So where we're at now is
they know that his brain
isn't sending the signal to
his heart to beat properly
at times and to breath
and to monitor his oxygen,
but they don't know why, and we're kind of
in this limbo point where we're waiting
for test results to come back.
- We're testing them.
- More testing to be done.
- But nobody knows anything.
They've never seen a child
like our child anywhere near.
No doctor around here knows anything.
- And they said that Andy's
best bet at this point is
for us to find another
kid that has identical
or even very similar
symptoms to what Andy has.
That's our best bet of being able
to get this properly diagnosed.
- And that's why we're here.
That's why, I mean, we
obviously feel a small
personal connection to this.
Every time we've talked,
I think we've cried,
but hearing the story from you guys
and then, we have an audience.
We have people who have kids
that may or may not be going
through this, and we want
to share this story with you
to see if you know of anyone
who's gone through this
or is going through this
to give this boy a chance.
To give your kid a chance,
because the more kids
who have this can be tested for this,
the more doctors will know about this,
the more chances that Andy
and other kids like him
will have to survive,
and what was it that you said
with the SIDS that four thousand kids?
- The airway condition I
had, it was in the trachea.
-  In the larynx.
- I had both in the
larynx and the trachea.
The year I was born, they had
about 1200 kids diagnosed.
About half of them were
diagnosed post mortem,
just to rule our SIDS.
And then out of the other half of us
that were diagnosed while we were alive,
there were only a couple
of us that survived.
We were all under the
care of the same doctor.
-  Literally, a couple of you?
- Just literally.
There was me and a little girl from Idaho
that they Life Flighted
to Primary Children's at Salt Lake City.
And it was divine intervention.
We've gotten better at
diagnosing in the medical world,
but it's still not a very high chance.
It's more of guess work.
If you see these things, you
bring them to the hospital
and we see if we stabilize the kid.
Does that make sense?
- Yeah, absolutely.
So we wanted to bring their
story to your attention,
and we wanted to see if there's
anything that we can do.
So what to do next if you know anything,
if you have anything that
you would like to share
or if you want to even know
more about the Whittakers story,
Andy's story, I'm going
to have their channel
linked in the description
down below and in the card.
This is a difficult time and
this has been a daily thing
for you for two years now,
and you've definitely had
your ups and downs, but I
mean, we have an audience,
and we want to help, and I think
that's one of the best ways
that we can help is to get
information out to the world,
I mean, that's why we're here.
That's what we want to do for you guys.
I've been touched by
your story and by Andy,
and I want to make sure that
we do what we can to help.
Like I said, all of their information
will be in the description down below.
(emotional music)
Meeting with the Whittakers
and talking made me
just so grateful for all of the blessings
that we have every single
day, and not only that,
it made me recognize and see how grateful
they were for every single day too,
especially every single day
that they have with Andy.
He is such a sweet little boy.
He is so happy.
- He loves to blog.
- Yes, he loved grabbing
the camera and blogging.
It was fun to be with them.
It was emotional.
- We met them a year ago,
but today we were actuallyable to sit down
and talk with them more
and this is something
that they definitely want.
They want their story out there.
They want to be able to get answers.
They're really hoping that with our reach,
that somebody will have what is going on
or know any more information
that can help them,
and so this was an emotional
day, and this is kind of
an emotional blog, but
I feel like good things
can come from this,
and our friends, they
definitely have approved
the video, the thumbnail, the title.
They want this out there.
They want their story to be heard,
and like she said today, it
is rough as it is and hard,
but it needs to be blunt,
and it needed to be said,
and I'm grateful that they,
that we found each other.
I love feeling their
warm spirit welcoming us,
and I feel very humble that they have felt
that way about us, and
it makes me grateful.
- Yeah, I mean, I just think about
if there is something out there,
what that could potentially mean.
If Andy's condition gets taken care of,
could that be a segue to
helping or curing SIDS?
I mean, think of all of the
people that this could help.
- That's definitely what
his grandma believes.
She's like, "I really feel
like there's a lot of things
"that are not being answered right now
"that doctors could look into,
"and they said the time is ticking,"
and they're really hoping
that this can be a blessing
for a lot of people.
- I mean, that's why--
- It's very personal,
and it's very scary to share
stuff, especially like this,
but there's a lot of unknown answers,
and like I said, they really would love.
So if anyone has any information,
you know where the email is
and we'll leave their channel
- We'll have their
- And their videos.
- In the description.
- They have more videos
talking about this as well.
It's hard to make so much
into one little video,
so definitely watch theirs,
and we love you guys,
and we can't wait to hang out again,
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
- Thank you for watching.
We'll see you later Andy.
Have a wonderful day.
- Bye Andy.
- Bye.
- Bye.
(emotional music)
