- It's show and tell
and I'm bringing this.
-  That looks awesome.
Your Ultimate Garage rocket ship.
Okay, can you go put
that in your book bag?
Can you go do that?
Your back pack, book bag,
I call it one thing, Dad calls it another.
We have a busy morning ahead of us.
And this mister, I don't
know if it's just taking him
a minute to wake up or
if he doesn't feel well.
His color looks like it came back.
He looked a little pale this morning,
but he is just waking up.
When I was at Bonnie's, I was saying
how I was a little nervous
for my doctor appointment today,
because Jared's not here
and they're doing an ultrasound
and I just still kind of have some nerves.
And my mom overheard me and she's like,
I'll come, she's like
I'll be there, when is it?
Nine o'clock?
I'll drive up.
And I'm like okay.
So my mom's gonna be here any minute.
We're gonna go to my doctor's appointment,
we got lots of errands,
I have a chiropractor appointment.
It's gonna be a great day.
I have noticed a huge difference
with going to a chiropractor,
like my neck, my head, everything
has felt so much better,
so I'm really glad that she was able
to get me in so fast a few weeks ago
and that I've been able to continue to go.
Whoa.
It fit all in there.
That's awesome.
- But I need to drink my juice still.
-  Okay go drink your
juice and get your shoes on.
- Okay.
- I can't believe it.
He gets dressed in the mornings,
he gets his shoes on.
It's amazing.
It's amazing how you're being able
to be a little bit more independent, huh?
What are you thinking?
Oh that's a smile.
That's the first smile I've seen on him.
(Ellie laughs)
Okay, change of plans.
Mister is definitely showing signs
that he would want to throw up, huh Mom?
- Yes.
-  Well we're only gonna
stay for just a few minutes.
(sighs)
- Today's the day, let's do it.
Did you just thumbs up
yourself in the mirror?
You bet I did.
Today is the day that I have
my speaking event with DJI.
If I'm being completely honest,
I'm a little nervous.
But not terribly nervous,
because I feel like
what I'm speaking about
is what I know.
It's something that I know,
something that I feel,
something that I believe in,
so I'm excited about it.
The issue is (laughs),
I waited 45 minutes for a taxi,
no Ubers were available.
It took 45 minutes to get
from the hotel to here
and I hopped out of my taxi
so I could walk the rest of the way,
because look, I'm going faster
than these cars right now.
This is insane.
The taxi that I hopped out of,
is like a block and a half away already.
(laughs)
- Calvin is going into a four hour nap.
Can you believe that?
Mom put him to bed.
- He's still laying
like he was when I left.
- He so tired.
Look a the gravy.
Mom just gave me a huge thumbs up, yay.
- Mmm-hmm, you're gonna
do it for the book.
- You're gonna do it.
- Yay.
- I got a roast, got her carrots,
we're having lunch.
If Jared was here, I would fix the camera.
I think the settings are off.
I can just tell as I'm moving it,
so, sorry Jared, he'll
have to fix it tomorrow.
I don't know how to do the settings,
but Mom just gave me approval on my roast.
- Big thumbs up.
- And as Calvin is sleeping,
Mom and I have just been talking.
And she just gave, I was
like you should tweet that.
She just gave the most
inspirational saying.
We were just talking about life
and just to enjoy it,
and she's like you need to just enjoy
the moment you're in, no
matter the phase of life
you're in or whatever job you have,
you need to enjoy it, because,
do you remember what you said?
- I can't remember what I said.
- She said because when you get there,
wherever there is, she goes,
you might not get there,
just be happy with what you're doing.
Be happy with where you're at.
- Yeah.
- You said even with you,
you're like, I don't
know where the end is,
or that light point is,
- Yeah yeah.
- just be happy,
so I liked that, good job.
- So I made it into the convention center.
We are here at CES.
And I got my badge and everything
and I'm ready to go.
But the hardest part about CES is finding
exactly where you need to go.
There are so many floors,
there's an east, a west, a north, a south,
exhibit hall and so many booths,
so I'm gonna have to check out this map
and see where I need to go.
Three.
Already found out, I
am on the wrong floor.
That was quick.
Oh my goodness gracious.
Home sweet home.
This is what kinda makes me nervous.
Look at this crowd that I'm
going to be speaking to.
-  Somebody woke up
with a smile on his face.
Are you happy?
Were you sick?
You slept from nine to 1:30.
Are you tired?
(Ellie laughs)
You look better, Cal.
You got some rosiness to your cheeks,
but you still look pale.
Hi.
You're at those chairs again.
- Yeah, I just rode in
one of those chairs.
-  I have a question for you.
- Sure.
-  Am I okay to open this?
- Yeah, yes, you can open it!
I got you a little surprise Ellie.
-  Thank you.
- You're so welcome.
-  That's cute.
- Yeah, so darnit I kinda wish I was there
to do this with you,
but do you want me to explain it?
-  Sure.
- Okay so what this is, every month
you will get a box
and inside that box, it's all based around
what you're feeling right now,
how far along in your
pregnancy you are right now.
So you're 15 weeks right now,
so this box is all catered to you
being 15 weeks pregnant.
-  Yay.
- And then next month
you'll get another one
that's like 20 weeks pregnant
and all that sort of thing.
So it's based on that kind of stuff.
So you get a present every single month
to help you get through your pregnancy.
-  That sounds really fun and cute.
- I love you so much.
-  Thanks.
- You're so welcome.
-  That's like a fun surprise.
- Yeah and how cool is it that it came
on a day that you got your ultrasound.
-  It was perfect, thank you.
- You're so welcome.
I love you so much,
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.
-  I didn't want
to open it if you don't
want me to, so.
- Oh no, you go ahead and open it
and you enjoy it.
-  Okay, thanks.
- Take a picture of
what's inside and show me.
-  Okay I will.
- Love you, bye bye.
- Well I thought that
was so cute of Jared.
Like two weeks ago, he's like,
don't look at the bank account,
and I was like, he never tells me not
to look at the bank account.
And so, thank you so much Jared.
And what a fun surprise to do it on today.
So baby is--
I'm 16 weeks.
Baby boy is the size of an avocado
and he can start to hear my voice.
He's growing his eyelashes
and his eyebrows this week
and he's forming his taste buds.
Is that cute or what?
Mom's doing my dishes.
Why are you so cute?
- Well I'm sitting here talking to you,
I thought you were talking to me
and I looked up and you're
filming and I went oh.
- No you're so cute.
I'm talking to you too.
And so I'm really excited to open this box
from what he told me.
I get one once a month.
How cute are you?
To Mom.
Cute.
Relax, we've got you covered.
This is better than going
to get a maternity massage.
(Ellie laughs)
So the boxes are 60 bucks,
it has a mask, a cosmetic bag,
a body wash, a little loofah,
wooden massager, yes, fun and some snacks.
Oh cute.
That is so cute Jared, thank you.
A little loofah, yes.
And a mask.
(gasps)
And a back massager.
Little did he know,
is he's gonna give me a
back massage tomorrow,
he probably didn't even know.
A little cosmetic bag
and body wash, which is perfect,
because I've been using his the last week.
Mom this is so cute.
Thank you Jared.
I seriously can't wait for next month.
This is like the cutest thing
to get for your wife, thank you.
Like I said, this is better
than a maternity massage.
I was thinking of maybe going to get one
and then I was like, no,
Jared will just rub my back.
I'll have him rub my feet.
This is fun.
Thank you.
This is the face and body mask.
It looks awesome.
And this body wash smells so good.
It has a very light mint
slash, yep, melon scent.
And that's exactly what it is.
And it definitely is a melon scent,
but it also is a spearmint,
like it's minty.
It's amazing.
Seriously, I'm so excited.
- I forgot to mention this
when I was talking about
being in a taxi earlier today.
The coolest thing about CES and being here
is you never know who
you're gonna be next to.
When I was in the taxi, I
actually shared the taxi
with someone and he was from Volkswagen
and he was talking to me
about the autonomous vehicles
that they are presenting today.
And I just thought that
was the craziest thing,
like we just so happened to
be sharing a cab together.
This little dad YouTuber
and a guy at Volkswagen
talking about autonomous vehicles.
That's the coolest thing
about these conventions.
You never know who
you're gonna be next to,
who you're having a conversation with
and who you're working on
your next project with.
And speaking of projects,
you never know who you're gonna meet
and what you're gonna do.
There's a couple cool cars behind us
and I think we might have some fun
with those cars here in just a second.
Ah, those are Teslas!
(growling)
(Calvin vocalizing)
(laughing)
-  Dangit, we embarrassed him.
- Look at his head above the couch.
Look at his head above the couch.
- I wanted a picture.
(laughing)
- Did you hear him?
Yay.
-  He was so cute.
- That was funny.
I did not think he was going
to run and hide.
He's a shy guy.
- Well I loved that you could see
his little head popping up
across the top of the couch.
That was so cute.
-  Bonnie just came over.
We cut Mom's hair, it looks great,
trimmed it a little.
- And by we, she means I watched.
-  I did it, it's okay.
(laughs)
- So we are back with Zack and Dan
and we met up with our
buddy Ben from Teslanomics.
And we've got two Tesla's here
and I'm kind of freaking out guys.
We've got a Model X and
a brand new Model 3.
If you didn't know, I have my eye
on the Model 3.
It's my dream car I guess right now.
So we're just gonna
drive around with these
for a little bit.
Dan has a fun video in mind
for the Teslas and we're
just gonna have a good time.
- Why don't you get one already?
-  I want to.
- He doesn't like my
tweets ever, like ever.
But if I ever do anything with the Tesla,
he's like heart, liking it,
sometimes he comments
on it with heart emojis.
- It's like the cry face emoji,
like it's so beautiful, oh all that.
Ellie, I mean come on,
you're kind of the limiting factor here.
Maybe we can make something work.
(laughs)
So one thing that we're doing out here
in the desert of Nevada,
(car motoring)
is we're testing out the shocks
of the Model 3
(car motoring)
which is right there,
and then the Model X.
The Model X has air suspension
and the Model 3 has coil suspension
and they've been driving by.
(cars motoring)
It's been pretty cool.
So how does it feel guys?
- It felt great.
It felt--
- Yeah?
- That was better.
- Yeah.
- So there is a quiz going around
that I shouldn't prompt you of what
I'm going to ask,
but I'm gonna ask you some questions okay?
First let's wipe your mouth.
Calvin are you coming up here?
Okay.
(playful music)
What makes Mommy happy?
- Smiling.
- Smiling?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes.
What makes Mommy sad?
(growling)
Oh when you do scary faces?
That does make me sad.
What is my favorite thing to do?
What does Mommy do a lot?
- Get ready.
- Get ready?
(laughing)
Yes, what is Mommy's favorite food?
Do you know what I eat a lot?
- Cereal.
- Cereal.
What does Daddy drink a lot of?
- Dr. Pepper.
- That's a good answer.
Do you know who my best friend is?
- Uh-huh.
- Who's my best friend?
- Philip's mom.
- Philip's mom?
(laughs)
- I mean Parks' mom.
- Park's mom Chelsea?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, Chelsea's my good friend.
That's cute.
If Mommy could go anywhere,
where would she go?
- Bonnie and Joel's.
- Bonnie and Joel's, that's a good answer.
Do you think you could live without me?
- Nope.
- Why?
- Because I want to stay at the house.
- Yeah, I want to stay at the house too.
How old am I?
- 13.
- I'm 13?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, what is my favorite color?
- Pink and purple.
- Pink and purple.
And how much do you love me?
That much?
I love you so much.
- I love you badder.
- You love me badder?
Oh my goodness, I love you badder.
- I love you badder.
- I love you so much I
let you mix the batter
when we make pancakes.
(vibrating lips)
(laughing)
I thought that would be a fun little
questions to ask Jackson
to see what his answers would be.
Some of those are really funny
and most of them were on point.
I am good friends with Chelsea,
I would like to go to
Bonnie and Joel's house.
Okay, let's do this again
in a few months, okay?
- Eeee.
- Oh jeez, now's the time,
Ben is letting me drive it.
Oh this is the key.
This is the key to the Model 3.
It's a card, it's like a hotel card
and you just put it on there.
Okay I'm doing it.
I'm not even asking, I'm doing it.
He gave me permission, I'm doing it.
Okay, I'll drive the car,
you man the camera, how does that sound?
-  I will do my best.
- Alright okay.
- Do we want you?
- Oh my gosh, you're
so much taller than me.
So you just take the key
and you put it right here?
- It's back here, I don't
know if you can really see it.
It's kinda dark,
but that right there.
- There we go.
-  And then you tap the breaks.
And then this is your shifter,
- Oh my gosh.
-  So you just
push that down for drive
and then when we're done,
you just tap it in for park.
- Tap it in for park?
- Yeah.
- So there you go.
- Okay.
- Okay, we're good.
I'm gonna line up
and then I'm gonna take off.
The thing about Tesla cars, it's electric.
It's instant, it just goes.
There's no ramp up from the engine,
a combustion engine,
so I'm just checking my--
(loud exhale)
Ready?
-  Let's do it.
- It's a Model 3, it's not that fast,
but this is still pretty fast.
- It's fast.
- Okay.
- Whoa!
(laughs)
Whoa dude, we only got up to 50.
(Ben laughing)
That was still really cool.
And you don't even hear anything.
That's awesome, oh my gosh.
Wow, this is amazing.
It feels good in my hands.
How does the horn sound?
-  I don't know.
(honking)
- That's a good sound for a car.
(honking)
I like that.
It's not too wimpy, it's
like a good medium so.
-  The S is overly aggressive.
You tap it and oh man, you feel bad.
- Yeah, you're like oh jeez sorry.
- You honked the horn everywhere,
you're like a little kid.
-  I wanted to hear
what that sounded like.
- I love it, I love it.
When you took off,
(honk)
I could feel the smile on your face
when you were driving away from me.
(laughs)
Alright, go enjoy.
- The one thing that takes
a little getting use to,
is there's nothing right here.
Everything you have is right here,
but I love how minimal that is.
Oh man that get up, that was a good one.
(laughing)
That get up and go is just so good.
Thanks for letting me drive it man.
This is so cool.
- Of course.
- Ellie Ellie, are you listening?
My birthday.
(laughing)
Probably one of the strangest things to me
is how you get out.
You push this button
and that opens the door
and then you just push it open.
That's kinda interesting to me.
Now that I've driven it,
I've gotta get a picture with it.
Is that kinda weird?
This is the person I want
to get a picture with
more than anyone at CES.
This Model 3.
- Oh you mean the car.
- Oh sorry Ben, yeah yeah,
you can be in the picture if you want.
Get out of town, look at this.
You can draw on the screen.
Look at that.
Ellie, it's our Model 3 now.
Publish, boom.
(laughs)
Yes, what, so should I do it or not?
- Do it.
- Should I send it to Elan?
- Of course.
-  Elan, it's coming your way dude.
-  I don't think he's doing enough.
(laughing)
-  Wait, so you're telling me,
you're not driving this car right now.
- Hands free.
-  What the heck?
Are your feet on the pedals?
- No feet.
- What?
(laughing)
-  This car is
driving itself right now.
That's insane.
Like look, you can see blind spot stuff,
you can see the car in front of you.
This is so crazy to me.
-  Yeah and you can adjust the speed
If you want to go faster,
well we have a guy in front of us.
You can change lanes and stuff too.
I'll wait for cars, so
it's a little bit safer.
So if I want to change lanes,
I just, without touching the wheel,
I just tap this to the right.
Oh, it's gonna do it and then get us back.
-  We gotta get
back over, that's funny.
- Well it did it,
it worked.
- Yeah it did it, yeah.
- Oh my gosh, it just blows my mind
that these things can happen now.
That's so crazy to me.
This is so cool.
Sorry guys, I'm geeking out,
I'm geeking out here.
-  Are you feeling better Mr. Cal?
He's been acting really good today,
hasn't had a fever.
He just took that big long nap.
We'll see how you do tomorrow,
but he's done pretty well.
How are you mister?
- Good.
-  You're good, we're eating a bowl
of fruit before bed.
We just had soup.
Can't wait for Daddy to get home tomorrow.
Did that put a smile on your face?
(Ellie laughs)
You can't wait to see Daddy
or you can't wait to see his little,
his game that you play with?
- What game?
- His Mario game.
Jared has this Mario game
that Jackson has figured out how to play
and he's been looking for it,
for a few days.
And I'm like nope, it's with Daddy.
Our lighting, like
everyone looks extra pale.
I know the settings are off on the camera.
(Calvin vocalizing)
I wish I knew how to fix it.
I'm gonna have Jared teach me.
When he gets back.
Okay Jared, I'm gonna have you teach me
how to do the settings,
because it's bad, it's out of focus
and it's bad.
