- My morning routine has totally changed.
I want to fake that pregnancy glow,
so that's what I do.
- If you had a sleepover
in your room with Calvin.
Calvin, don't be afraid
of the vacuum, dude.
(Jared laughs)
(vacuuming)
- I was wrong everybody.
I was wrong, Jared was right.
(harmonica playing)
Good morning.
What face is that?
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
Good morning.
This is the first time Calvin's ever had,
or at least he doesn't get mad,
he got his pancake cut up today
and he was happy about it,
'cause Calvin had his cut.
But it's taken you a long time
to warm up to that idea of cutting
Mickey Mouse up, huh?
He's pondering his thoughts right now
as he's eating.
We are making Mickey Mouse
pancakes this morning.
Due to Jackson's request.
Do you like 'em?
- Uh-huh.
-  This plant
has been through a lot.
There has been a few times
where it has pretty much
died and come back to life.
And I did it,
I accidentally killed it,
I forgot to water it while we were gone.
And look, I watered it yesterday,
I trimmed it up and a
new bud is coming so,
I think it's gonna make it.
It's gonna pull through and be okay.
I really really love that plant.
And I'm so glad it's pulling through.
Not my typical eggs and avocado,
but this'll work.
It's so cute.
Do you guys remember nine months ago
when I brought up those little people toys
and put them in my bedroom
for when the kids wake up
that could give them
something to play with.
And it took a long time for them
to actually do it and
then they would start
to play with it.
Well now, my morning
routine has totally changed.
I don't know if it's because
the kids have grown up more,
or if it's because they really know,
Mom said this and she's
not getting gout of bed
or I don't know.
But I have a new little morning routine
that I've been doing.
It's been a very lazy one, but I love it.
I, usually when the kids
wake up at seven o'clock,
I'm up with them.
I'm up with them, we're making breakfast,
we're going to the
bathroom, getting dressed,
getting going for the day at seven.
And that's how it's always been.
I've have always been up by seven anyway,
and that's what time my kids wake up.
And lately since being pregnant,
it's like I can't get out of bed.
I still need just another hour.
And so when the kids wake up,
I say go downstairs and go play together
and then I'll get up,
and we'll make breakfast.
And they've been doing so good.
Like Jared has to go
in his office at seven.
He starts working at seven,
and then the kids have been playing.
And sometimes they'll lay
in bed with me and snuggle,
sometimes I'll just turn on a show,
but most of the time, they leave the room,
so I can sleep.
And they go downstairs and play.
And I've been so grateful for that,
so that's been my routine
and I know that won't happen in six months
when baby comes, so I'm grateful for it.
They're down there.
Are you guys playing?
-  Yeah.
- So that's what we've been doing
and then I just get out of bed,
then we get ready for the day,
and I slowly get ready.
And I've been really loving that.
(Calvin vocalizing)
It's been like a slow routine,
but I like it.
Here's the deal, the last week,
I have hardly gotten ready
and I want to show you
what I've been using
when I get ready.
All I've been using is
my Bobbi Brown concealer,
corrector under my eyes.
I've been using mascara,
and I've been using,
that's bronzer, and I've been using blush
and a little bit on my eyebrows.
So I've been doing just very little bit,
just so I can be a
little ready for the day.
Today's Friday, I don't
know what my plans are,
I don't know if we're gonna go out
for a date tonight.
I've asked a few babysitters,
I don't know if they can
or if Jared and I are gonna stay in,
just hang out with the kids.
I don't know our plans,
so I'm just gonna get ready today,
ready ready today, and
a lot of people asked me
what concealer I've use.
I use the Bobbi Brown Eye Corrector first,
because it's like an
orange based corrector,
just because I have such deep eyes,
and I have a lot of discoloration,
so I just do it in the corner,
and that just kind of helps brighten it,
before I put a little concealer on it.
Like look how dark that inner corner is.
It doesn't matter how much sleep I get.
It's just kind of hereditary.
But it definitely looks
worse if I don't get sleep.
I think it's definitely more red.
I start with that
and then just because it's winter
and my skin is uber dry, I'm almost out.
I've had this for two years,
it's the Tatcha Luminous Dewy Spray.
Jacklyn Hill had talked
about it forever ago.
I just spray it on my hands
and just put it on my skin.
It just gives you a really glow-y look,
especially if you've
put your foundation on.
It's just really dewy,
it's a dewy mist,
and I want to fake that pregnancy glow,
so that's what I do.
(laughs)
My skin is super dry with the winter,
so this just helps.
I'm trying out a foundation
that Goss Makeup Artist talked about.
It's a Tom Ford foundation.
I really like it.
I can tell why he likes this brand.
(bright music)
On days that I really
want to get ready too,
I'll wear a Tarte concealer
over that corrector.
That corrector just corrects that blueness
and then I put just a concealer over it.
But, you know what has
been my favorite thing,
has been getting my eyebrows
micro, micro bladed?
Yeah, micro-bladed.
I'm really glad that I did.
I wish that I would've been able
to go in and get a second one,
because that's where the
pigment will really hold.
And when I have the baby
and I heal and everything,
I'm gonna go back and have my eyebrows
redone a second time.
I really have loved having
my eyebrows be done.
Excuse me.
(laughing)
Excuse me, trying to get ready here.
Excuse me, excuse me.
What are you doing?
- Poo poo butt.
- Don't call me a poo poo butt.
Talk nice to Mom.
Are you gonna help me?
- But this is not coming out.
Can I hold it?
- Take that out.
- Okay, I got it.
- We are going to be
building a little table.
I don't know why we decided
to do it right here,
we just kinda took it out of the box.
And Jackson asked if he could help.
Ooh.
- Now the top.
- Now it says put bolt A in,
take your screwdriver,
start screwing it on here.
- Okay.
- Oop oop.
Yep, all the way down.
Perfect, I think that looks good.
-  There is that.
- Next.
- That's--
why do we need that?
What a splendid table.
That's cool.
- It's cute.
-  Do we need more--
do we have to do it too much?
- There we go.
Okay, come down here.
- Okay.
(bright music)
- I'm doing a few set up
things around the house,
so when we had Calvin,
we moved his crib a lot of times.
We had it in with Jackson,
we moved it to his own room
and to Jared's old office,
then we moved it into our room.
We just kinda had to figure out
how life would be best.
And with us gonna be having
a baby in the summer,
I'm just kind of thinking
about the bedroom scenarios
and Jackson and Calvin.
What they want, what'll be best.
And I think I'm gonna move some things
around the house tonight
with Jared's help.
And see how the boys do together.
I already know they'll do good together,
because whenever we travel,
they sleep together.
- Is this the right way?
- That is the right way.
When we travel, they sleep together,
but just so I can get a feel for it
night to night, them sleeping,
so we're gonna just
switch some stuff around.
I have a fun set up that I'm
gonna do with this bad boy,
I have some chairs
coming that I'll show you
when everything's here and
set up, I'll show you guys.
But I'm excited.
Your face.
You're concentrating, good.
Is it tightening?
- Mommy and Daddy were thinking
and we think this would be very fun.
I think it would be fun
if you had a sleepover
in your room with Calvin.
Would that be so much fun?
Would you like that?
You're kinda thinking
about it a little bit, huh?
But your bed it's big,
but it's not that big.
I think we need to make some changes.
So what if we did this.
Follow me, come follow me.
Okay, hold on, hold on tight.
Okay, Mom is sitting on
Jackson's bed right now,
- Which we love.
- Right?
-  We love this bed.
But look, come over here, follow me.
Yeah, this way, this way, this way.
This bed is so much bigger.
So what I'm thinking,
let's move this bed into your room.
- But we should put this
blanket on Calvin's bed.
- Sure we can do that.
So it gives you more room to
sleep on the bed with Calvin.
Right, would that be fun?
- Even there's two pillows.
-  Yeah, there's even two pillows
that you guys can have.
Should we do that?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- But we can share my new blanket
what Santa gave me.
- That would be so fun, that's
so nice of you to share.
So we're thinking transitions, changes
and everything and this
is just the beginning.
This is kinda like testing the waters,
wouldn't you say?
- Yeah.
- To be honest, I've gone back and forth
with them sharing a room,
-  100 times.
- And I still will,
but I just want to do this.
Because we were gonna bring
the other bed in here,
but then with both these beds in here,
I don't want any of them
-  Getting on the
shelves and everything?
-  Grab 'em there and fall.
- They'll fit, both of
these beds will fit,
but then one bed will be right here,
so they'll be tempted to pull on it.
- I'm afraid they'll fall on those,
so we're just gonna switch them around.
Some people might think,
we'll just go put 'em in
there then for a few nights,
but I'm doing something in there,
and I can't have them in there.
- Yeah.
That room is going
through some changes too.
And we want to keep the crib upstairs
so when Calvin goes down for naps
for when the baby comes,
and all of those different things.
So we feel like this is the least amount
of movement with the
biggest amount of change,
for the most amount of experimentation.
- And either our decision will be
they'll just stay in that bed,
what I really want is
just to get bunk beds,
because I've always wanted that.
- Oh my gosh.
- Who wouldn't want bunk beds.
-  Who doesn't want bunk beds.
- But I think for now, this'll be fun.
- Yeah, gless you.
I caught it.
So this may take some time.
Luckily, we don't have too much,
because I feel the frames are
small enough and light enough,
we won't have to disassemble anything.
At least, I'm crossing
my fingers and hoping.
-  Disassemble, you're
moving beds out of here,
totally you'll have to disassemble it.
- Well I'm crossing my fingers
to see if we don't have to.
- Jared, you cannot fit
a queen bed through that.
-  I will try it.
- No you're not.
- You can't even lift it.
- We'll see.
-  I'm saying us together.
- Have you not seen my muscles?
I almost beat Joel in
an arm wrestling match
and--
- It won't fit.
You can lift it, but it's not gonna fit
through that little space.
-  We'll see, let's test it out.
- Nope.
(lively music)
(vacuuming)
-  Calvin, don't be
afraid of the vacuum dude.
Look, they've got like
a little barrier set up,
to protect themselves from you.
- That's cute.
- Taking the bed apart was actually
a lot easier than I thought.
We have these little switches
that you can just lift up,
instead of unscrewing it like the crib.
So right down there, we just lift it up
on the bed frame, boom,
pop that right off,
pulled it right out.
And I honestly feel like this headboard
is so tiny, that we can just fit that
through the door.
That's what I was talking about,
by moving it all at once.
Obviously we won't do it
with the mattress on it,
because the mattress is
heavier than all get out,
these mattresses are heavy.
(lively music)
Oh, good save Mom.
- I was wrong everybody.
I was wrong, Jared was right.
(harmonica playing)
-  Okay now we're
gonna swing this over.
- This looks awesome.
- Boom baby.
(harmonica playing)
What do you think?
- Yay!
- Do you like it?
- Boing boing, it's so bouncy.
-  Okay lay down, lay down
like you're going to sleep.
-  Yeah pretend like
you're gonna go to sleep.
-  Goodnight.
Goodnight Cal.
(mock snoring)
(laughing)
How fitting are their pillows?
Jackson Calvin,
Batman, other avengers.
(harmonica playing)
Superheroes.
- This is all just to test out
how the boys are together
in the same room.
-  Consistently.
- Yeah, because if they
sleep through the night
like this, boom, we're getting bunk beds.
You know what I mean?
-  Yes, this is cute.
- I like having friends
who are in the same stage
as us, like Bryan and Missy.
We've actually talked about this with them
and how much better
their boys are sleeping.
It's like, okay, let
that happen to us please.
Yeah, Missy was like, it
was the best decision.
We were a little nervous,
but she's like, it turned out great.
My chiropractor, she has two girls
and I asked her, I was like,
this is a weird question,
do your girls sleep together?
She's like not anymore, but they used to,
and she said that they
used to sleep better.
Okay and what if the boys do really well
and we just don't buy bunk beds
and this is their room for two years,
until Jackson's like six or seven,
isn't that weird?
And then we do bunk beds.
Like slowly going into
it, how fun would that be?
Ah!
There's so many fun things.
Life changes.
I said what if we waited a few years,
because they're like toddlers right now
and when they were both
older, then do bunk beds.
You know?
- He says my bed.
Now that Batman's on it, he's like okay,
I can agree with this.
-  Thanks Maria.
Our sister-in-law Maria
made these for the kids.
And then some cute viewers made those
for the boys.
Isn't that the perfect bed?
Go to sleep.
-  Pretend like
you're going to sleep.
Go to sleep.
(harmonica playing)
- I'm sure everyone
listening is like uh shh.
Okay, shh, go to sleep.
- My snacks.
- Hey no!
-  The clock is yellow.
- Hey no!
- Hold your horses there,
hold your horses, hold your horses.
- Oh my gosh.
- Hold your horses.
(laughing)
hold your horses.
Oh, it's a crazy horse!
It's a crazy horse!
(laughing)
Are you guys ready for your bed?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
-  Yay.
- What book are we gonna read?
- Little Blue Truck Halloween.
- Woo hoo.
- Woo hoo.
- I love Halloween.
- Get under the covers.
-  Yeah, let's get
under the covers boys.
- You cannot get out of bed.
I want you to not get in Mommy's bed.
Okay Calvin?
- Why?
- This is my bed.
- This is your bed.
- Because you have a baby in your tummy?
- Because I have a baby in my tummy
and Mommy needs to sleep.
- Mama baby.
- Okay, I need to sleep.
I need to sleep!
-  That's so true.
When this clock, this clock is blue okay?
When it turns yellow,
you can get out of bed okay?
- Yes!
- But Jackson's good at that.
-  Jackson's really good at that.
So you help your little brother Calvin
stay in bed until it's yellow, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey don't punch me.
- Okay, ready to read?
(laughing)
- This is our kind of world.
The boys fell asleep really well.
Calvin took a lot longer like usual,
which is fine.
- Let's peek on 'em.
(gentle music)
Look at his foot.
So far, so good.
It's been a few hours,
since they've gone to sleep,
so hopefully things stay this way.
- We'll let you know.
- Yeah, so stay tuned
for tomorrow morning,
where we find out how
things actually went.
But for now, we are
going to say goodnight.
It is Friday night
and we are gonna go to bed.
So thank you guys so much for watching
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
