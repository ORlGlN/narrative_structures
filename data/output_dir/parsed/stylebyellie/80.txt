- What do you wanna get?
- A nice hat.
My hair's a mess.
- This is as good as we're getting today.
- What do you think of your glasses?
-  I like 'em, thanks.
- You're welcome, they're
nice and rose gold.
- Jared ran to WalMart.
-  Hi baby!
- Good morning, baby.
- Oh my gosh.
- Ellie, your belly has popped.
- Look, that's just in the morning.
Holy cow.
- Wait 'till you get a
good meal inside of ya.
-  I'm out of breath.
- Goin' up the stairs?
- I tried the stairs.
Kay, fun adventurous day.
The sun is out.
We're gonna go play.
- Yeah, I got some cool
aviators like Ellie did.
I went to the store and
grabbed some sunglasses.
So here's the situation.
Everyone is literally
getting in their cars.
We're gonna go have a blast today
and I am using my phone
to upload the video.
I'm not uploading from my phone,
I'm using my phone as the upload place.
So I'm using YouTube on my
phone to upload the video,
and it's taking a lot
longer than I thought
so I'm literally like
as soon as that's done,
I'm sprinting out to the car
and we are gonna go have a blast.
We're gonna go take the kids
to a place that looks like Mars,
and I know the kids will
have so much fun there.
It's going to be so great.
So come on, Internet.
Come on, YouTube.
Upload.
We gotta get going.
We gotta have a blast
on the last day of 2017.
Yes, today is December 31,
the last day of 2017.
So we've got to end it on
a great note, right guys?
-  All right, kids.
We're about to take you
somewhere very, very special.
Do you know where we are?
- Pioneer Mountain?
- No, wrong.
We are on the Planet Mars.
We're on Mars, and we're gonna
go explore the floor of Mars.
- Let's go.
-  Go, let's go, let's go.
(Laughing)
Lets leave the kids
here and say (mumbles).
(laughing)
Uncle Jarrod smoked his
peyote this morning.
We had a great morning.
It was good.
And now we're gonna go have fun on Mars.
Okay, okay, so this is
called Pioneer Park,
it's this beautiful red rock
area that looks like Mars.
We were here a while
ago with Carl and Ginger
and we're taking the rest of the family
to go look at it and see all of the cool
rocks, the formations,
and explore a little bit.
(upbeat music)
(music continues)
- I see the city!
(upbeat music)
(laughing)
-  So now we know how
to keep Calvin entertained.
(Laughing)
-  Here you go, old friend.
-  I'm bringing it back to ya.
-  Hey Cody, this thing
keeps running away from you.
- Next on the agenda is
the most uncomfortable place
I have ever been in my entire life.
Literally thought I was going to get
caught between a rock
and a hard spot and die.
Do you want to do it with me, Joel?
- I would like to get caught
in a rock and a hard spot.
- So just around this corner
over here, is a rock pass
and you have to shimmy your
way all the way through
and it gets tighter,
and tighter, and tighter
'till the very end when
it finally opens up.
We've done this before, and
that was about five pounds ago
so I don't know how this is gonna be today
but we're gonna give it a shot.
Are you gonna do it, Ellie?
-  Yes.
-  You are?
- Last time I had Calvin strapped to me
so totally I can go through.
-  So it starts out perfect,
and then the more you go,
it gets narrower and
narrower and narrower.
- Ooh!
I'm gonna give this brown
glassy shell to mommy.
-  Let's see it.
Oh, fun. Yeah.
-  I got you one.
-  You did?
- It might be broken glass, I'm not sure
but it's the thought that counts.
Stay right there by the side.
-  I'm sorry I'm chickening out,
but I can't do this.
-  It's a little intense.
I don't know if I can either.
-  Yeah, I
feel a little anxious.
-  Wait boys, wait.
Jackson, stop right there, please.
-  Okay Mama's Turn.
-  Watch your
head, watch it, watch it.
-  How does
anyone fit through that?
-  Do you see that?
That's what we're gonna
try and go through.
Watch daddy go first okay?
-  Oh my gosh.
This is intense.
Okay go.
-  Daddy, I'm very nervous.
-  Okay come this way.
-  You doin okay Cody?
- These kids are walking
sideways through this.
-  Kay, if you guys have any issues
with claustrophobia,
this is it.
- When you get
to this tight spot, your gonna get out.
This is crazy.
-  You gotta wait just a second.
- This is crazy.
-  You gotta
let them go first Kyle.
- I could see how my mom
could have panic attacks.
I don't know...
Like its getting narrower Jared.
I'm literally not looking ahead.
Oh my hell.
(chuckles)
-  Are you doing good?
- I can see why people
have freakin panic attacks.
Oh my hell.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my hell.
-  You need my hand?
Grab my hand.
Yeah.
-  No I can do it.
-  Good job guys.
Here's the big spot.
We're almost all the way out.
You guys doing okay?
-  Yeah, we're doing okay.
- Oh that's good Jackson.
I'm glad you're doing okay.
-  Mom will never do this again.
(chuckles)
-  Well you won't be able to
with your pregnant belly
getting in the way.
Oh my gosh the camera not...
-  You doing okay?
- The camera's too wide.
-  You can do it.
-  Open your hand.
There you go good job.
-  Holy crap.
-  You're doing good?
-  Yes doing good.
-  Kay.
-  I don't know.
I got caught in my chest at one spot.
That was the only spot where
I got tight around my chest.
-  (chuckles) I
can't believe they're
walking side ways like that.
(chuckles)
-  Daddy are
you getting squished?
I am getting squished.
I just gotta stand up a little up here.
-  Oh my gosh.
Okay there we go.
-  Like why are we even doing this?
-  Okay Calvin give me your hand.
Oh you got it.
You are doing so good.
-  Are you scared or is this fun?
-  Fun.
-  Fun.
I can see bird poop all over there.
-  The worst part is
when you can't turn your head.
That makes me anxious.
- Oh yeah.
When you're literally stuck.
My mom has never liked tight spaces
and I've never cared
but to be honest I Feel
like since having Calvin
my body has become just different.
Like I used to love this stuff
and I don't.
-  Are you okay?
-  Kay are you guys good?
What is going on?
(wailing)
(mumbling)
-  She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes.
-  When she comes.
- Have you done this before?
-  Yeah I've done it once.
- Have you Joel?
- Nope.
-  You guys are doing good.
-  Uncle Jared I can go through.
-  Oh my gosh.
Like I don't know how.
-  See Uncle Jared?
-  Good job mom.
Can you stand up okay?
-  Are You Guys Okay?
-  Yeah you did it.
-  I'm not gonna lie.
I borderline almost started crying.
(laughing)
I feel like I want to cry
cuz I just accomplished that.
(laughing)
Sounds dramatic but it really was...
-  Oh my gosh Lincolns here.
(laughs)
-  You had Lincoln the whole time?
-  Lincoln made it?
Good job bud.
-  Look at that tiny space.
All the way.
That's what we just squozed through.
All the way.
That was intense.
I've never done that before.
Last time I was here.
I had Calvin strapped to me
and I couldn't fit and he was asleep.
Holy cow.
That was crazy.
-  Was that awesome or what?
-  Happy New Year.
New us.
- Happy New Year.
-  They don't know
that they're riding my trike.
(laughing)
That's funny.
I love that they are doing it together.
-  You guys like my trike?
(laughs)
-  That is Joel
and Jared everybody.
