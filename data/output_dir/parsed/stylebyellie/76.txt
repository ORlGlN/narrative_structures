- Come on boys, let's get our shoes on.
There's so little to do
and so much time to do it.
-  I have
something little to bring.
Or actually reverse that.
- A jack-in-the-box.
- What's that?
- It's the jack-in-the-box.
- Perfect, that's a
perfect show and tell item.
Today is Jackson's
first day back to school
in the brand new year
and we are getting ready to go.
We've got two minutes actually.
So let's go.
- Put it in here.
- I want you to wind this up.
-  Here, Mom
will lock it up for ya.
(winding music)
- Perfect.
- Great.
- Now I think it's show and tell,
but we're gonna leave it in here,
and you'll only get it out
when your teacher says, okay?
- Okay.
-  You got your shoes on?
-  Yep.
-  Good.
Come on Cal, let's get
your shoes on buddy.
Oh good, you got your show and tell item?
Buzz Lightyear?
Come here and let's get
your shoes on, Buzz.

Oh he's like no way Mama.
Trust me, he'll want it

It's cold.
-  Hey my shopping buddy.
How are you?
- Good.
- Are you my shopping buddy?
So I was watching, I think her name is
At Home with Nikki
or Cleaning with Nikki.
She's on YouTube.
She has this awesome organization channel
and I have been just throwing
all of my Christmas bulbs,
just throwing them in a box,
and a few of them have
broken because of that,
and I want to do a little bit better
with me putting my tree
down and organizing.
So I'm at Big Lots and they have these
awesome storage things for the ornaments.
I'm just gonna get a
few things to organize
as I put the tree away today.
I'm a little late on
doing that, but oh don't--
Oh naughty naughty.
Well that was a little naughty,
throwing all of my cards out.
Okay, I got everything put back together.
Sit on your bottom.
Thank you.
And guess what, if you're really good,
maybe we'll get a snack,
maybe some crackers or something.
Did you have fun at school?
- Yeah.
-  Did you show
'em your show and tell?
- Yeah.
-  Did they love it?
- They laughed at it.
-  They did?
- Mmm-hmm.
-  Did they think it was cool?
- And I did this, woo woo!
-  When you opened it up?
- Uh-huh.
-  And what was your favorite thing
that someone else brought?
- A tooting monkey.
-  A tooting monkey?
That's crazy.
♪ I cry the day ♪
♪ That I take the tree down ♪
♪ I want the season ♪
♪ To last all year round ♪
- Guys we're taking the tree down.
Well actually, Ellie is gonna
be taking the tree down,
because I have an errand to run.
Are you gonna help Calvin?
Did you like the Christmas tree Calvin?
Yeah, was it pretty fun?
You like playing with the ornaments, huh?
Yeah.
- Did you break 'em?
(laughing)
- Oh oh oh!
I have proof downstairs
that says otherwise.
You know what?
This picture that I'm gonna
insert says otherwise.
(dramatic music)
- What picture?
(dramatic music)
-  It's a picture
that says otherwise.
(dramatic music)
(laughing)
Okay, I've got to run a quick errand.
- Hey, are these gonna hold my big bulbs?
-  Let's see if
these balls will fit.
-  No, just this one.
-  The big one?
Ooh Ellie.
- Will it?
What the?
- Oh no!
-  Sorry.
Your balls are too big.
- Well that sucks.
-  Welcome to my world.
(Jared laughs)
- Throw it away, there you go.
-  Throw it away?
- No put it down, I'll put it in the box.
Not there, you're breaking it.
-  Alrighty.
Have fun taking the tree down, sister Sue.
- That's kind of annoying.
- I'm sorry.
- Will this fit?
-  Will your little balls fit?
Yep, Oh!
Barely.
- What the heck?
Not everyone has teeny little ornaments.
-  Yeah, 'cause
you can only fit like 12--
- Okay, this'll work, this'll work.
-  Yeah, that's better.
You just gotta put it the right way.
Good luck, good luck, bye.
- Ah!
-  Oh!
Looks like Calvin's not the only one
breaking ornaments, Ellie.
- I'm self-conscious when I say ornaments.
- Because you used to say ordaments?
- Leave me alone.
-  Okay bye.
- Every time Penny gets groomed,
she hates having the little paper towel
or, not paper towel,
the handkerchief on her.
She hates it.
But this time, she's left it on,
she's done so well.
I'm so proud of her.
Oh, Jared's working with her.
- Okay, good girl.
- I don't know if it's because I just
am having the full day to myself,
just unwinding, taking the Christmas down
or if it's because I'm 15
weeks pregnant and I'm tired.
It's taken me hours.
But I'm going slow,
because I don't want to
just throw everything
in that room downstairs.
I kinda want to organize stuff as I go.
Because before the baby comes--
What?
- I want to play with
one of those puzzles.
- Okay let me go get one.
In the bag, I need to figure that out.
- I want the lightning.
- The lightning?
- Yeah the car one.
- When you're done with that one,
I'll give you another one.
- I want you, but I want help.
- Okay I can help you.
Let's go in the living room.
Yeah, before the baby comes,
I want to organize,
I want to make sure all of the rooms
are how I want them.
And even now, my house is organized,
it's clean, we moved in a year ago,
it's not too bad,
but there's just a few
things I want to do.
Like we still have our temple picture,
where we got married, I
want to hang that up above
the piano downstairs.
I just have a few small
things that I want to do.
That main bedroom downstairs
is like all decorated and stuff.
I have a bunch of picture frames
that I want to put up
and put like my grandma, Jared's grandma,
our moms and pictures
of them on that wall.
But the rest of the room looks really good
and it's decorated.
So, just stuff like that.
I just want to do some things.
So the baby comes in six months
and that's a long time,
but in a way, it goes by so fast,
and so I just want to
slowly do things as I go.
(clicking)
(Calvin vocalizing)
Taking a break and working on
some bullet journaling.
I'm just starting my planner for the year.
I'm very excited.
These are my goals.
I just have one goal
and that's just to feel at peace
with whatever decisions I'm doing.
I feel like a lot of my stresses
are always like self caused,
and a lot of times, I just need
to make decisions or decide something
and feel good about what I decide.
So that's my one goal.
And I'm sitting here trying to draw,
and trying to make it look really good.
And I find it ironic
that I was drawing the word peace,
as Calvin was screaming at my feet.
So I got him taken care of.
The kids had a little drawing session,
but they were done after two minutes,
so I'm gonna sit here and keep doing it.
I'm just like,
I'm just all over the place today,
that's what I'm doing and I love it.
- Ellie, I'm super impressed.
- Ah!
-  Uh-oh.
- Don't use the eraser
until it's officially dry.
-  Ellie that looks so good
and look at that peace.
That looks so great.
-  Thanks Jare.
-  The one thing
is your E and your C
and your E, you're kinda sloping down.
- Yeah.
-  Other than that,
it's really really good.
- I have such a hard
time being consistent.
-  It looks really good.
- I can erase it and do it again.
- Do it, do it sister girl.
Show me that hand lettering.
-  So wait, should I erase C and E?
-  C and E and then yeah,
make 'em the same size as your--
- This is what I really
do like about Jared,
he'll be like that's great,
but I want help, you know?
-  Yeah.
- I didn't see it, to be honest.
So there's the A.
- You just want it to be
on that line right there.
Penny, one thing that
is very true about labs
is that you shed way too much.
I mean look at this, look at this.
I'm outside with Penny.
We're in the garage.
We are going to clean up her dog bed.
We're gonna vacuum the inside,
we're gonna vacuum that,
wash it, and I'd like to do
a little before and after.
This is kind of gross, I know,
it's dog hair, it happens,
we have to get used to it a little bit.
But we've actually been really good
at maintaining the dog
hair inside the house.
We brush Penny a lot and
it's been really good
throughout the house but
her dog bed, where she--
(crashing)
But the dog bed, that's where Penny sleeps
has tons of hair
and we just want to clean it up for her
so it's not staying on her,
that excess hair is not staying on her
wherever she goes.
So we're gonna clean it up
and I'll do a before and after.
(scraping cloth)
(vacuuming)
Hey.
Is that your bed?
Are you not letting me get on your bed?
Do you want me to clean it for you?
(Jared laughs)
And here is the after.
Oh my gosh, doesn't it
look like brand new?
That is amazing.
If I get a little bit more hair off,
I think I'm gonna actually
throw it in the washing machine
and let it dry and everything
and then it'll look like brand new.
Come here Jackson, look.
Listen, do you hear that?
- Yeah.
- What do you hear?
I don't hear anything else.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
-  Your rock tumbler is done.
Should we go get it?
- And my rocks?
-  Yeah.
Well they're done with the cycle.
Let's go get 'em and see
what they look like, okay?
- Okay.
We should go get them.
- Okay.
- We should get them.
- It stopped.
-  It stopped, yeah.
Okay let's go look.
They're in there.
- I can't wait to see 'em.
- Me either.
So we have Jackson's
rock from the first cycle
and it's right here,
so we can compare it to
the rocks in this cycle.
We've got some bowls that we're gonna
pour everything into,
and then we'll be able
to see what they're like.
Oh I need to get the sifter,
so we can get the water out, okay?
Okay, I'm gonna open 'em up.
-  Okay.
-  Are you sure you want to hide?
-  Yeah.
-  Why do you want to hide?
-  Because I
don't want to see them yet.
-  Okay.
-  Have you opened?
-  Not yet.
Okay, it's open.
- Ewwww.
-  Does it stink?
- Yeah.
Those are not good enough.
-  Oh that does stink, huh?
So now what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna rinse some
water over the top of this--
- Okay.
-  into this bowl, so
we can see what they look like.
- Okay.
I'm gonna hide again.
-  Okay.
Here we go Jackson.
-  Those are beautiful.
- What?
-  This is so fun.
- What do you think?
- Do you like 'em?
- How did they get like that?
- They're polished.
Where's your other one?
Oh look, this is a good comparison.
Look at this one, next to this one.
So this was the first round.
And this was the second round
and I think these are the similar stones.
Isn't that incredible?
-  Oh my gosh.
This is fun for me.
Jackson what kind of rocks are in here?
Look.
- That's Calvin's favorite color.
What the?
-  Oh this is my favorite.
- What the?
- That's beautiful.
- That looks so cool.
- We should get one more.
-  Look at those.
Okay or even like this, 'cause they're--
- Whoa look at that.
Show them that.
- I want to do all of them.
- Look at that detail and dimension.
- I wanna do all of them.
I'm gonna do all of them.
-  Do you want
to keep all of them out?
- I'm gonna keep all of them out.
-  You can, but
let's do it one more time,
so that they're really shiny.
So you chose one.
- This one, because
this one's even shiner.
- Look at these rocks.
Look how glossy they are.
-  And we still have
two more times to buff 'em.
- This is so cool.
And I think the biggest part,
the coolest part about this,
is that we have a refill pack,
so we'll be able to see them
from the very beginning
to what they are in the last stage.
- We should put these in my jar.
- That looks like wood on a guitar,
like that's so cool looking.
- I'm gonna get you friends.
Got you.
Ha ha, got you.
I farted on your guys.
(laughs)
Excuse me.
- We've got the next grit,
number three all set up
and we've gotta let it go for seven days,
that's one full week, okay?
- Okay.
- Hold on, let's get the days first.
Count with me,
one two three four five six
- one two three four five go--
- six seven.
- seven.
-  And?
- Blast off!
-  Pkkkkkkwwwwww.
(tumbler humming)
- Okay, one week and we'll be looking
at them again okay?
- Okay.
-  Say bye rocks.
-  Bye rocks.
- Have fun.
Boy today rocked, didn't it?
Did you see what I did there?
Because we just did the whole rock thing
with Jackson and his
rocks, and today rocked.
So, jokes aren't as funny, when you have
to explain them Jared.
They're not as funny.
