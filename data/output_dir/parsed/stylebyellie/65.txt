- Come here.
I've got something for you,
I've got something for you.
Ellie, I'm feeling our baby.
-  Now look at a Who.
(Jared laughing)
They look identical.
- You stop right there.
- Oh no.
Oh good morning, I feel a little full
in my belly, oh no.
I must've eaten too many sweets
and too much Dr. Pepper.
(laughing)
- (Calvin yelling)
-  Good morning bud.
(Calvin yelling)
-  Good morning.
Hey, where's Calvin?
(laughing)
What are you doing?
No that's no my actual belly.
You remember that I told you guys
I got some goodies in Las Vegas for you.
- Yay!
-  Would you like to see them?
- Yeah.
- Okay, and I'll give 'em to ya, kay?
One of the funniest things
when I told the kids
that I was going to Las Vegas,
they said, are you gonna see Boss Baby
while you're in Las Vegas?
'Cause that's where they go
at the convention center in Las Vegas.
So when I was in Las Vegas
I thought of something
that I could get you
and there's not a lot of
things that you can get
kids in Las Vegas.
(laughs)
That's kind of a joke.
Yeah, there is a lot of stuff,
but I didn't have a chance
to go out and about.
But I wanted to get you guys something
that I thought would be fun
for you to keep for a long time, okay?
So this one's for you.
Don't open it yet.
And this one's for you.
Don't open it yet.
Mommy.
-  What?
- Come here, I've got something for you.
I've got something for you.
-  I got something!
-  Come sit down
on the couch Mommarino.
- Okay now I'm excited.
-  Yeah.
This one's for you.
-  Thanks Jared.
(Jared laughs)
I love little things.
-  Okay go ahead
and open 'em up guys.
- You open first, I want--
- You want me to open it first?
- Oh perfect.
-  It's a Las Vegas magnet,
because we visited Las Vegas.
- I thought it was an ornament at first.
-  Calvin open it!
- Okay.
Hi.
(gasps)
-  Okay, it's my turn.
-  Do you like that?
It's like a little mini snow globe.
-  Yeah.
- My turn.
-  Go ahead bud.
-  Look.
What do you think?
-  Shake it up.
(bright guitar music)
Is that cool?
Here if you turn it upside down, watch,
you can see all of 'em come down.
- Thank you Dad.
-  You're welcome buddy.
- Thank you Jared.
This is cute.
- You're welcome.
- What a fun morning.
-  Yeah, do you like 'em?
- I think that's cute,
because they loved the snow globe.
And this is mini.
-  Yeah.
- Hard to break that one.
- Exactly.
We had fun, now it's back to work.
We got things to do around this house.
(bright guitar music)
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
I had to sprint up here to get the camera.
Oh I still feel him.
- Isn't that crazy?
- Ellie I'm feeling our baby.
This is the first--
oh my gosh!
- He is right there.
He's low.
- He is.
- He is so low.
Someone commented, they're like,
you're carrying so low.
And I'm like, with all of my boys,
I've carried so low.
- Oh my gosh, 16 weeks,
I am feeling the baby.
- Not too hard, because it's sensitive.
- Oh I'm sorry, sorry sorry.
I don't want to squish our little baby.
I don't think I've ever
felt a baby this early.
- It's his back.
And when the doctor was
doing the ultrasound,
he could hardly even get
a picture of his face.
'Cause his back is right there.
- Is he like a little hermit?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
But he's so low.
- Oh yeah he's pretty low.
- Isn't that cute?
- Yeah, our little lowrider.
- Yeah.
(gasps)
That's so weird.
- I want to be involved.
- I won't show you where he's at,
because he's super duper low,
- Yeah.
- but I'll show you my tummy.
Is that crazy?
-  Hi little baby boy.
- He is so--
That's crazy.
-  Ellie.
- Okay so when the doctor gave me
that ultrasound picture,
-  Yeah.
- I could hardly--
because it was his back,
they all looked like blobs
and Jared's the one that
was like look at his face
and he looks just--
-  A Who?
- our other boys.
Oh let me show you the
picture I put together.
I was like, are people
gonna think I'm being mean?
So I didn't post it.
- Well I guess it fits, 'cause
I look like the Grinch, so.
- Well I've always thought Jared,
when I first noticed him,
this is just unique.
-  Uh-huh.
- and look at the baby.
Okay so look at his ultrasound.
You can see his lips there,
his nose right there.
Now look at a Who.
(Jared laughs)
They look identical.
- That's so funny.
- Isn't that cute?
-  It's funny
Ellie, it's funny of you
to realize that.
- I just had been staring at his picture
thinking he's so cute.
- Aww, our little boy.
We literally poked him too much
and now he's gone.
- He moved, he's gone, I
don't know where he is.
(laughing)
- Sorry bud.
Who?
(Calvin screams)
(Jared laughing)
Caught ya.
Hi bud.
You having fun in the Hello Room?
- Yeah.
- You got those darts on your fingers.
Did you guys ever get Bugles,
those corn tortilla chips, and
you put those on your fingers
and pretend you were a witch.
- Yes, my mom never bought 'em,
but I loved when my friends did have them.
- Or olives.
Did you ever put olives on your finger
or anything with a hole inside it
that you put on your finger?
No yeah some?
I'm still on a high from feeling the baby.
That's so cool, it's just
very tender and sweet.
I remember--
Wait, how'd you get up there?
I remember when I heard about you
for the first time.
It's pretty fun, huh?
- Hey, you stop right there!
- Oh no, he's on to us, he's on to us.
-  Get him, get him, get him.
- Oh no.
Ah get away!
Oh no!
(Jackson yells)
We're trapped, what are we gonna do now?
Oh no, we're locked in forever,
forever.
- Forever.
- Forever.
- No!
-  That's a bold
move, he's making an escape.
Oh he's out of there.
Ah no, ah ah!
Run away Calvin,
- Dad Dad!
- while you still can.
- Dad Dad, help help!
-  Run away while you still can.
- Dad!
- What a good soldier,
he wants to stay with me.
He'd rather be captured,
than run away by himself.
I've been locked in by my own kind,
when will you let me out?
It's been 20 minutes since
I've been locked in here.
I'm beginning to starve.
There's a little water here.
Even though it's a full size kitchen,
for kids, there's little
food and water to drink.
I'm beginning to hallucinate.
I just don't know how I'll ever escape.
(gasps)
Oh wait, there's a window.
How did I not notice that
in the last 20 minutes?
(playful jazzy music)
(whistling)
Right there.
(squeak and pop)
Day log journal, day 325,
it seems like no matter how hard I try,
I cannot escape the window.
My hips just won't lie.
My hips don't lie guys.
I think my only escape
is if I make friends with the locals here
and exit through the front door.
Will that happen?
Okay we're through.
(whispers) Let's see if we can get out
without them noticing.
-  I meant junior.
I'm all free.
I made it out alive.
I made it!
I'm home free!
Free at last, woo!
Feels good to be free.
Feels good to be free,
oh no!
- There you are!
- Ah, he's found me!
(laughing)
You caught me.
I'm sorry.
- Don't don't stop!
- I'll stop.
I'll stop.
- No.
- I'll stop.
You caught me again.
-  Jackson asked if the cheese came
and Calvin ran and grabbed cheese.
Is that for dinner?
Yeah, we ordered pizza
and we have a blanket out.
There's a new movie, it's Paddington 2.
It's in the movie theaters.
And I want to take the kids to it so bad.
But they haven't seen the first one,
so we're gonna sit, we're
gonna watch Paddington.
Bonnie says she loves it
and it's a cute movie.
We have pizza.
Calvin just came up to me and hugged me
and hit my belly and lifted up my shirt
and goes, baby.
And just nuggled my stomach.
- It was cute.
He rubbed his nose on your belly.
It was sweet.
- Awww.
Okay, I think we're watching Paddington
more than the kids, but I love it.
- I've been having a good time,
it's a funny show.
-  They're over there
making food for each other.
- It's pretty rare for Ellie
to ask me to get her something,
something that she
doesn't usually ask for.
It's a Dr. Pepper.
So you either know she's
having a really really good day
or she's like, I just
need a little pick me up.
(laughs)
So I'm getting Ellie a Dr. Pepper
with a straw.
Those are the requirements.
She's in the bathtub right now.
So I think she just wants
a little relaxation mode
before she goes to bed.
Oh my goodness, last straw.
I think Ellie is due for a nice warm bath
and a little Kardashians
or something like that
and a Dr. Pepper.
-  My head hurts.
- I'm sorry your head hurts.
-  It's because I had to cancel
my chiropractor appointment.
- Well let's see if we can
get you in tomorrow, yeah?
Or the next day?
-  That goes to show it's working.
- Oh yeah, 'cause you
missed it and you're like,
oh my little head.
Oh my little head.
Oh don't flip me off.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Go away.
- You want to know one
of my favorite moments
in Ellie and Jared history,
is when you flipped off the camera
when you had your D&C.
-  Yes.
- It was raw and real
and I think it was just tender, you know?
-  What do you think
my number one emoji is?
(laughing)
- Enjoy your bath and Dr. Pepper.
-  Smiley face and flip off emoji.
- Are you gonna watch
Kardashians or something?
-  No, I'm gonna
look at maternity shirts.
- Ooh maternity shirts.
If you guys have any ideas
of where to get cute maternity clothes,
-  I did see awesome ones.
- Let us know in the comments.
Ellie tweeted out,
and everyone's gave her
some really good ideas.
And then I tweeted out
if anyone has any idea
where I can get a good Tesla,
let me know.
I'm such a nerd.
And I play off your tweets, it's funny.
Sometimes I wonder to
myself, and I say self,
why are you doing this?
And sometimes the answer is simply
just because it's the internet.
I'm not sure how this reaction
is going to go, but I wanted to show you
what I'm putting in the video
that's goes up for me tomorrow,
for you it's been awhile.
But I'm putting this in the video.
I don't know why, I
think it's kinda funny.
But alas, here it is.
This is the internet.
(bright music)
Why I'm doing this, I have no idea.
I thought it was funny,
maybe it's not, what do you think?
I don't know, I'm sorry about that
if you didn't enjoy it.
Penny, you are doing exactly what I want
to be doing right now.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you up too much.
Oh get that stretch out.
Get that stretch out.
So I've been talking with Dan.
We did a test of the Model
3 versus the Model X Tesla
on their shocks, and he
just sent me the first draft
and it's a really cool video.
So when that video is up,
I will put a link in the description,
so you guys can check that out.
We had some pretty interesting results
when we did these tests,
between two Tesla cars.
Just makes me want a Tesla all the more.
I'm sorry it's annoying by now,
but that's beside the point.
Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
