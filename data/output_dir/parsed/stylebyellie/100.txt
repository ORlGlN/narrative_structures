- Good morning guys, I'm
sitting here in my office
getting some work done,
getting some videos edited
and while I was trying to
edit one of the videos,
I couldn't find one of the
SD cards that I needed,
'cause we filmed on two different cameras
one of these days.
And I was looking all over the place
for this SD card.
It wasn't in the camera,
it wasn't in this camera,
it wasn't in my computer
and I was scrambling around,
like where the heck is this SD card?
I'm looking in the kitchen,
my bedroom, everywhere
we would normally have
an SD card when it's
outside of the camera,
next to my laptops.
Lo and behold, I found it in
the weirdest place possible.
And I have no idea how it got there.
Let me show it where it is
and tell me if you think
this is kinda crazy.
We have this little post-it notepad thing
and there's one page, two page,
oh my goodness, underneath the glass,
there is the SD card.
And I have to think, one of the kids
somehow got the SD card,
came into my office and
was just messing around.
Everything else is kind of in its place,
nothing's really moved around,
but that SD card somehow,
got slipped in there, and
that is the craziest thing.
I am so glad I found it.
So you have this video today.
- So as I'm getting ready for the day,
I wanted to show you guys the lipstick
that I've been wearing the last few days.
I've had a lot of--
Oh it's dark.
You guys have asked me the last few vlogs,
of what I've been wearing.
And it's new to me, it's a NARS lipstick
and it's like a lip
gloss that turns matte,
so I guess not lipstick.
It's a lip gloss, and
then when you apply it,
it turns matte.
I'm trying to see if there's
like a good name for it.
But this is, oh my--
(signal tone)
And it's lasted me all day.
I kiss my kids, I love it.
The shade I'm wearing is power matte,
American woman, is what I'm wearing.
I've had a lot of people ask what it is,
so hopefully, this will
answer your questions.
I don't think I've ever
owned a NARS lipstick.
I like Revlon, I like, what else,
I have a lot of Smashbox and
yeah, I don't think I've
ever owned a NARS one.
But I would love to get a red one,
because they really do last all day.
And I used to wear LipSense quite a bit.
(atmospheric music)
And then it'll dry.
I used to wear LipSense quite a bit,
and I still have it.
A lot of people have asked me,
I've gone back and forth, I've like it,
I haven't liked it.
And I'll use it once in awhile.
I tried it for two months straight
of using it every day,
because that lipstick is the type
where you have to wear it
and you can't switch
between other products,
which I don't love,
because it's always fun
to try other products
and to wear other stuff,
so that's the one thing
I don't like about it,
is you're kind of stuck
to that one product.
And I don't like anyone to tell me
what I can and can't
wear with my make-up so.
(laughs)
There we go, ready for the day.
See, it's been on for
like two seconds now.
And it won't transfer on my teeth now.
Oh it will.
(laughs)
It will, but it does dry
and I do kiss the kids and it doesn't seem
to wear off, that was funny.
- You also kiss me too sometimes.
- Yeah, sometimes.
- If I've been good.
(laughing)
-  Hi Calvin, are you doing okay?
You were really sad when
Jackson went to school.
- He was so sad, that
he wanted a wed straw.
-  A red straw?
- Yeah.
A wed straw?
- A wed straw.
- Did you get a wed straw?
Let me see it, is it red?
- Yeah.
-  Say red.
- Red.
- Red.
You cutie patootie.
Curly hair.
(laughing)
(bright music)
- Oh! (laughing)
Here we go.
(laughing)
Was that fun?
- Again.
- Yeah.
- Again?
- Yeah.
- Okay, one two three go.

(laughing)
One two three, hup.
(Calvin laughing)
Okay ready?

(laughing)

That was a high one.
(bright music)
That was a high one.
High, you want to do high again?
- Yeah.
- One two three hup.
(laughing)
- High!
- High?
-  Ta-da!
- Jackson, how hi bud.
- Hi!
How are ya?
You scared me.
How was school?
- Good.
- Good.
- Do you want to go high?
One two three hup.
(laughing)
(bright music)
Come over here.
-  What?
- Come over here, come over here.
Come over here.
- What?
- Stand right here, stand right here.
Okay, boys are you ready?
- Yeah.

One two three oopsie daisie.
One two three super high.
You want to go super high?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
One two three hup.
(laughing)
Jackson, look at the op, turn around,
oh look at your shoulder,
lookit, right here,
it's right here, it's right here,
it's on your shirt,
right there, right there,
right there, do you see it?
What is it?
- Rainbow.
-  It's a rainbow.
Do you see a rainbow?
Now it's on your forehead.
Now it's on your hoodie.
It's on your arm.
There's that red, oh where'd it go?
Do you know why that happens?
- Yeah.
-  Tell me.
Yeah.
So what happens is there's
a light source out here,
and that light source comes
and goes through a prism,
and this will act as a prism,
and when the light hits the prism,
it breaks all the colors apart
into a rainbow.
Is that so cool?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, wait
children, before you go,
come over here, I want to
show you another thing.
Look at all these rainbows.
(gasps)
-  What?
Wow.
-  Is that so cool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Science is literally
happening in our living room.
Roygbiv, Red orange yellow
green blue violet.
- Look what I got?
- Ta da dun.
-  Where did you get that?
- At school.
-  Why did you get it at school?
- Because.
-  How did you earn it?
- Because I got 10 gems.
-  10 gems.
How does a teacher give you a gem,
is it because you're good or do you clean,
what do you do to earn a gem?
- Be nice.
-  Be nice and
you earned 10 of them?
And then you got a prize?
And you picked that one, huh?
- This one, yeah.
- I'm so proud of you.
That's cool.
Okay, well we are going to be building
a puzzle right now.
- A puzzle.
- Jackson loves puzzles, so,
usually at least once a
day, I need to wipe this up,
we build a puzzle together.
- Now that we've had fun
playing in the bedroom,
throwing the kids onto
the bed and the pillows,
we've done a little puzzle
attempt by you and Jackson.
- Jackson did awesome.
I really hardly did it.
-  Oh he did all of this?
- Of course I helped,
but he, like I put all the green together.
I said this looks like the Hulk.
- Aww, that's awesome.
- He did a lot of it.
- But you could tell
he got a little tired.
And he was done.
- So now the kids are downstairs playing
and Ellie and I have decided to take
the next 10 or 15 minutes
and micro clean, okay?
Just take a little bit of time,
use your Hello microphone.
Microphone, this is a walkie talkie.
- Hey Jared, how's your office been
since I cleaned it?
- Spick-and-span.
-  No it hasn't.
- Yes it has.
Okay let's go in there right now
and we'll do a comparison,
compared to what it used to be,
to what it is right now, okay?
- I really, I think it's
more funny than anything.
In here.
-  I'm gonna let you go in.
- It's not bad.
- It's not bad
-  is right, I got
a few things right here.
See?
Not too bad is it, mmm?
(bright music)
(Jared laughs)
- The wall?
- Nope.
We're eating apples.
I don't know why we're on the floor.
-  The ceiling.
The ceiling.
- The ceiling?
No, what else is white around here?
Look around on the floor maybe.
- No.
That's brown.
-  No look next to you.
- What?
What is it?
-  Look on the ground,
what's on the ground around here?
That's white.
Not that.
What?
- Santa's hat.
-  Yes.
- My turn.
- Okay.
- I spy with my little eye something blue.
-  Something blue?
Is it the rug?
-  Apple.

(Ellie laughs)
-  My apple.
Is it the painting on the wall?
- No.
-  Is it

Yahoo!

about seeing you boys bundled up
in your winter clothes
that just makes me think
you are the cutest boys
I the whole dang world.
You know that?
Do you know that?
- Yeah.
- We're gonna go, you guys and me,
and Penny, we're gonna
go take her for a walk
in the mountains.
Do you want to go with me?
- Yeah!
- Okay, let's go get Penny
and let's go get in the car.
And you take your finger out of your nose.
(laughing)
Let's go.
There's a little seat?
- Uh-huh.
-  Did you find a good spot?
- Yeah.
-  Good.
Well isn't that just a picture
perfect moment right there?
Oh perfect, now Penny's in it.
(Jared laughs)
You guys are just the cutest, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Are you guys having fun?
- Yeah.
-  Good.
Yay!
- Stop.
-  Stop.
What's the password?
- Hey!
- Oh he tricked you, he gypped you.
He gypped you.
(Jared laughing)
So we're on a little date night, you know?
- I love date night.
- It's just a little date date.
So the past three or four years,
I feel terrible about this,
but TJ has a play called Juanito Bandito
and it's locally famous
I think throughout Utah,
but especially northern Utah
and every Christmas they have a play
and every year they've invited us to come
and every year, we've had something else
interfere with the play.
But not this year.
This year is not that year
and we are going to the play today.
They've invited us to come
and a bunch of other
YouTubers are here too.
And we are gonna go see Juanito Bandito,
which is this hilarious comedy play
that TJ puts on every single year.
Say hi TJ.
- Hey.
- Hey.
-  Hey we'll see
you in the show man,
good luck, break a leg.
- We love the Mecham family.
- Sorry.
-  Oh thanks man, thank you.
- Yeah don't strangle it,
I'm not down with that.
-  Okay.
- Jared just hugged me
and he goes, I'll be right back.
-  I had my hand right here.
- And he goes, oh you have love handles.
-  I was like,
what, there's love handles.
(laughing)
- I was like thanks, I'm pregnant.
He just hugged me, he goes
you have love handles, woo.
- I've got something to grab onto.
- Every kid has fallen on this.
I feel so bad.
There's been like five that have tripped.
He's okay, his dad just picked him up.
Okay, see you in a sec.
- Alright guys circle
up, circle up, circle up.
- Why?
- In my hand, I have four pieces of gum,
but don't you announce it,
(Bonnie loud breathing)
because as soon as someone
knows that you have gum--
(laughing)
(coughing)
-  Give her all four.
- I love Bonnie, but not that much.
- As soon as someone knows you have gum,
you're the gum guy.
And everyone's coming
to you, asking for gum.
- Put your hand out before it's gone.
- Did you just give
Olivia one, she's a child,
she doesn't need it.
- We'll go halfsies okay?
- No no Olivia, you gotta go halfsies.
Olivia halfsies!
We went halfsies.
(Olivia laughing)
I like a half piece of gum.
Oh see I told you.
I told you, I told you.
Put it away.
Everyone put it in your mouth.
Shhh, everyone be quiet,
the play's starting.
(laughing)
- It is not, but I wish, oh it is,
the lights are going down,
oh crap, oh shhh.
I wanted to show how beautiful it was.
-  Well they
already saw my mustache,
they should know.
♪ Don't die Christmas ♪
♪ I love it ♪
- So he tells you he doesn't
want to do a-caroling?
This is a liar.
- Wa ah!
Oh!
- It's freezing.
- It's so cold.
- In Utah, what's the degrees outside.
- Oh there's no way that's right,
it says 31, it's way colder than that.
I got your seat heaters on.
- It says 20, it says 18 on my phone.
- Okay 18, we're gonna go with 18.
- That's about right, 18 degrees.
Ah, that'll warm the fire up.
(laughing)
- Oh Ellie that's the worst.
Ellie Ellie,
you can't--
What do they call it?
- Covered wagon you!
- Covered wagon me.
You can't cover wagon me in my own car.
(mock crying)
- So we met Juanito Bandito
actually at the doctors office,
him and his family were
going in for an ultrasound
and we met him,
and we've been wanted
to see Juanito Bandito--
-  Juanito Bandito.
- We've been wanting
to see that for years.
And it seems like every
time we go to do it,
it's the holidays, a
family party comes up,
one of us have a cold or whatnot,
we have never been able to go.
And this time, we went
and it was very funny
and I liked hearing his story beforehand.
He was gonna be a doctor.
He went to medical school,
he decided after a year
like it wasn't for him
and that's like a hard decision to make.
And now he is running this,
this show all year round
in different locations.
- He's in charge of this
Pickleville Playhouse
and they put on shows.
And this is his dream and
that's what he loves to do.
- Didn't even realize that
that's what he was gonna do
and it's just I feel like lately,
I've just been more and
more happy and proud
of people doing what works for them,
being able to bring in an income.
My friend Jenny I'm so proud of her.
I met her on YouTube years and years ago
and she started a jewelry company
and she runs it through her Instagram.
It's been able to support
her, I'm so proud of her.
We met Rad Swimwear tonight,
she does the same thing,
she sells swimming suits in Utah.
And I've fallen in love with her.
She's a kind person.
And it's just been so fun to meet
so many different people do
so many different things,
and then here we are,
doing what we love,
and it's just really exciting
and I hope that everyone feels that way,
no matter what job you have, you know?
Whether you are a doctor or an engineer
or whether you work out of your home,
it's just really cool to see
and it was really cool to go tonight
and we loved it.
We loved the company we were with,
so many of our friends were there,
and it's late.
We're gonna go home and go to bed.
We have a really fun day tomorrow.
-  Woo hoo!
- I think everyone feels this way,
like a few weeks before Christmas,
like you want to do fun stuff,
but it's work work work,
you're busy, you're crazy,
and this next week is gonna be
a huge week with watching
all the IVF videos
and then the week of Christmas,
it's like vacation mode, you know?
So, tomorrow though, we are
taking a break tomorrow,
because we are doing
something very very special.
- Oh but there will be
a video, just you wait.
It's a very special video.
- Yes yes.
- So thank you guys so much for watching.
And we'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
(announcement music)
