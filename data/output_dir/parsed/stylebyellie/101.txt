- Yes!
- Kiddos.
- Hi.
- Do you know what we're doing today?
- Yeah
-  What are we doing?
- Going to the fire station.
-  We are?
We are gonna go celebrate firefighters!
- Why?
-  because they work so hard.
And do you know that
they are on call a lot,
they have to work, a lot and sometimes,
they don't get to be with their
families as much as we do.
So we're gonna go tell them thank you.
- Sometimes they don't
get to spend Thanksgiving
and Christmas with their families
because they're working for us.
- What about the fire?
- That, that's right!
They have to be all ready for fires.
Sometimes they miss being
with their families,
so we're gonna make sure
that they get a chance
to be with their families today and
we're gonna make that happen.
I remember working retail and I would
miss out on all of these
family parties and--
-  or be late.
- And I would be late and that's
just like a small fraction
of what these guys go through,
like they miss so much
because of their duty, what they do.
And it's so honorable
and it's so incredible,
but family is so important to us,
and I know it's so important to them.
-  and that's why
they do what they do.
- Yeah, exactly.
We love to give back during the holidays,
but there's only so much
that Ellie and I can do
on our own and so we're
excited to announce our
partnership with T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls, and HomeGoods
to help make all of this happen.
Family means so much to them,
that we wanted to do this.
They make sure that
they don't have their
employees work on the holidays.
And we're so excited
to be working with them
and we're gonna make this party happen
we're gonna bring these families together
with their firefighter spouses
and it's gonna be great!
- And they don't know about it
-  It's a surprise!
-  So that's what's
gonna be really fun.
- Its a surprise!
Okay, you boys ready to get going?
- Yeah!
-  Okay.
-  Should we go have a party?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  We're gonna eat
some food and we're gonna
give them some gifts.
- Yeah we are.
(holiday themed music)
We're here at the Pie
Dump, this is where the
firefighters love to
hangout, before, after shifts
and we're setting it up
and we're almost done
with everything.
- That's a soccer ball
- Soccer ball ornament!
-  Yeah!
The kids are getting everything
set up on the Christmas tree
and we've got all these gifts for
the firefighters' kids down here.
This is so cool.
Are you guys putting
ornaments on the tree?
- Yep!
-  Good!
You're such good helpers!
You're like Santa's little elves!
- I love this.
-  This is the room where
the magic is gonna happen.
Yeah! (laughs)
These are the magicians,
to make everything happen.
All these kids are gonna
get all of these gifts.
Isn't that cool?
- Yes.
-  The families are about
to walk in and we are about to
surprise the firefighters.
Like, that's gonna be cool.
-  Firefighters don't know
that their families are here.
-  Mhmm.
- So the families are eating,
they're gonna come here and then when
the firefighters walk
in, they're gonna see
all their family!
-  It's a big surprise!
I love surprises!
There's no promises here,
but I may get emotional and start crying,
so if I do that, you
gotta be my back up, okay?
- Oh no, I totally will,
I totally will too.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey everyone!
So, the firefighters are almost here,
so lets kind of like, make a semi-circle,
a semi-circle of awesomeness and
surprise and we'll welcome
them all in here together.
-  Okay, they're walking in
Here they come!
-  Daddy!
-  Surprise!
-  Hi! (laughs)
- Yay!
(clapping)
(holiday music)
Jackson, you are doing so
good with the snowflake!
You're following the lines and everything.
Good job bud!
We've got cookies that we're decorating,
we've got gingerbread houses, we've got
a hot chocolate bar, this is so fun.
All these families are getting together.
(holiday music)
Alright, you guys ready?
-  Yeah!
- Open your presents! (laughs)
and I'll get some people,
we'll hand these out
(holiday music)
Oh my goodness!
It feels like Christmas morning. (laughs)
Is this fun guys are you having fun?
- Yeah!
-  Good!
This is so awesome.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah, grab some socks.
Awesome.
- (laughs) That's why I don't talk much.
- Ellie just got really emotional
We're making these gift
baskets to give back
to those who are less fortunate,
who don't have the gloves, the socks,
the blankets, the mugs to stay warm.
Just the basic things that everyone
needs to have to stay
warm during the winter.
So we have these baskets, and we're doing
a little assembly line and putting
all these baskets together for everyone.
Ellie you are cute, you know that?
- So that hat would be perfect there.
-  You're cute getting all
emotional about that, you know?
-  and the little red wagon
is perfect for the fire department.
- There you go!
And there it goes! (laughs)
-  Do you hear that?
- Merry Christmas.
-  Santa!
(cheering)
(gentle holiday music)
- It is soft isn't it?
-  Why do you have a beard?
- Well that keeps my face warm
-  Is there anything
else you wanna ask Santa for?
- A jeep patrol.
- A jeep patrol?
-  Ooh!
-  One last thing,
do you wanna tell him
what you're grateful for?
Are you grateful for anything?
Are you grateful for your brother?
-  and your family?
-  Okay.
-  Okay, hop down.
-  Say thanks Santa!
- Thanks Santa. (laughs)
- Ho ho ho!
- We just got home, the kids are in bed,
and we are quieting down for the evening.
That is a wrap on our weekend filming
with T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods
for the local firefighters,
the awesome party that we had,
I hope, hope that everybody truly had fun.
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed seeing the
families meeting them,
hearing them, talking to them,
seeing the kids interact and play.
This has been a very fun couple of days.
- What was the most
magical part for you today?
- Ooh!
- There were two parts where
I could, I was just like holding back
the emotions, is when
the families first saw
their spouses, the firefighters
coming in through the room.
And how excited their kids
were to see their parents.
-  Their parents, yes!
- Like that just like,
oh, my heart strings!
And then when we had our special guest,
Santa come in.
That was a surprise even for us.
We didn't know he was coming until today.
You know?
He's got a busy schedule!
- It was!
The whole, all the kids,
it wasn't like screaming
and crazy chaotic,
it kind of just all got quiet and
it was just, it was a very
nice ending to the evening.
- It was very special when
that happened, like yeah.
Thank you for coming along behind
the scenes of this very special shoot.
We want to thank T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and HomeGoods
for sponsoring the video
and being a huge part of it
and making sure that
family is such a core part
of their values.
Because it is so important to us.
If you guys want to see the
full video of what we did,
I'll have it linked down below.
But that's gonna be it from us!
Have a wonderful day and
we will see you next time.
- Bye.
- Happy Holidays!
-  Say bye Penny!
-  Bye bye!
-  Bye bye bye! Bye! (laughs)
