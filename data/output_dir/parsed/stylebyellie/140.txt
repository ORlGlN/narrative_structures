- While Jared and I were gone,
Jared came up with this awesome idea.
So I think that you should explain it.
- Alright, well we know the
internet is a funny place.
There are some weird
corners of the internet.
And we have gone to some of those corners.
Maybe not all the way into
that corner, but nonetheless.
- We're getting close though.
- So I went on to Amazon
and I was just like
let's find some weird things
that Ellie may or may not use
or I may or may not use and-
- Preferably, what we would
use, because that would be nice.
So we found some cool items.
- Some cool items. Just some weird
things that we found on Amazon.
And we're gonna go through one by one,
open them up, see if they're cool.
- Test 'em out.
- And let you know about 'em.
Everything that you are going
to see here in the video
we will have listed in
the description down below
if you're interested and
want to try for yourself.
So should we go to the first one?
- Um, totes. Toilet. That one.
I picked Jared's items, he picked mine.
- Yup. This is something
that we should have had
for Ellie a long time ago
and maybe even Bonnie.
- This is for you!
- This is the public toilet survival kit.
So shall we go to a location?
- You dibs it.
- (singing) Doo doo doo, gotta
go potty and I'm in public.
(fake screaming) That's disgusting!
If only had a public toilet survival kit.
(ding)
I do!
(singing)
-  (laughing) This
is not an advertisement.
- This is not an advertisement, I'm just
trying to give a real-life scenario.
So what is inside of here?
Is this what they're calling toilet paper?
Oh no, this is a toilet seat cover.
So you get a toilet seat cover.
Just tear that out. Hello!
So we'll put that down on the toilet seat.
Don't worry, I've got gloves.
I feel like if you really
need to go to the bathroom,
this is not going to help
at all 'cause you're like,
oh crap, I've got to
fumble with all this stuff.
And you get little wet naps, so that
will probably go on before this.
Finally.
K, be serious though.
Would you use this in a normal situation?
-  Heavens, no.
- Probably not. Oh, it's gone.
- Did it go in the
toilet? I think it's okay.
- I'm not gonna pull it out.
But if I did, I've got gloves.
- You know what's really
good though, that.
- Oh, poopourri. No joke,
we're fans of poopourri in the house.
- I don't think I would ever use that.
I think that would give me anxiety
and I would swear up a storm.
- Yeah. Just flush it down.
- I don't know how I feel about this.
Jared got lip plumpers for me.
- You always say that
my lips are just little.
- You do have little lips.
I don't ever have a
desire to have full lips
because I like my lips, but this will
be interesting to see if this works.
So we're gonna test this
out and if it does work-
- Maybe you'll have me do it all the time.
- Do it for date night,
so I have plump lips.
- You'll enjoy kissing
my lips more than you do.
- Make sure your lips are clean.
- Wait, let me see your lips.
- I thought you were gonna
lick them for me. Oh.
Luckily, it came with two.
Jared didn't know that.
We were just gonna share
one, but now we get our own.
- That's more hygienic.
You can do the other bag.
- So it comes with a toothbrush,
maybe to exfoliate your lip?
- It's probably the
brush to clean the thing.
It comes with a thank you
card, that's nice of them.
- Step one: clean your
full lipped enhancers
with mild soap and water. No, no.
Next, we recommend lightly
exfoliating lips, got that.
Wet the area around your lips
with water or moisturizer.
I would never do this.
The moisture's not necessary but
may help establish tighter suction
which is key to a good result.
- I've never blushed my lips before.
- Don't do it too hard, you
don't to- I've done that before.
Position your fuller lips above your area,
hold tightly into place, and begin
to suck in short puffs of air.
Let your lips relax and then
the enhancer will improve.
Oh wow.
How do you do it?
(suction noises)
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
Begin sucking short puffs
of air out of your enhancer.
- Hmm? Mm?
- I don't know if I'm doing it right.
- Mm, mm, mm.
- They're purple!
- They definitely feel a little bigger.
- They're purple!
- Is that bad?
- They are full. I don't know.
I was trying to do it right.
Mm, mm, mm hmm.
- Okay, just keep it
in there for a minute.
Ow, my lips hurt real bad, Napoleon.
So it's literally just a
plastic thing for suction.
I feel like I could do
the same thing with a cup.
Ready? One, two, three.
I think they do a difference.
Whoa!
- It's all itchy. Purple?
- Yeah, they're definitely purple.
This is probably not
good, because you have
a giant ring around your lips
and then it's all purple.
- Ah, my face is itchy
(snorting)
in my nose.
- Did you hear that?
- I just (groan) my face.
I mean would I really do this
before getting ready for the day?
- No.
- No, it would be a lot of work.
Just overline your lips
and not my favorite.
That kind of hurt.
- I'm going to be going like
this for the rest of the day.
Next up, we've got a self-stirring mug.
- I got this for Jared. I thought
the kids would actually love it though.
- Especially with chocolate milk.
- 'Cause every morning, at
least when it's been cold,
I've made the kids
chocolate milk and I stir it
and I think that they would
think that this was cute.
So I kind of got this
for you and the boys.
- Just in case you forgot, they have
it on the label. Self stirring mug.
- Did they have to do that?
- So there's a cap on here.
- Amazing. That's a cool mug.
- Yeah, so you can have a hot chocolate
and stuff and all that, but there's
a little yellow button
on here that says stir.
- Let me go get the stuff to put in it.
- Oh and two triple A
batteries from my office.
Needs batteries. Batteries
are not included.
- K, spoon, water.
- Ooh! Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Yeah, it's hot dude.
- Yeah, that's hot. I was just seeing.
- Yeah, we're gonna drink it.
- K, let's put the bottom on.
Alright, so the big question is
how many scoops of cocoa to the water?
- Oh I would say like three.
- Three, that's actually
what I would say too.
That's what I've done my whole life.
- Heaping.
- Yeah, do not go light on the scoops.
They're definitely big scoops,
but three scoops. There we go.
- It's gonna be weird not to stir it.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
(grinding noise)
The kids are going to love this.
Are you kidding me?
They are gonna love that. I love it.
- It sounds intense!
That's a mixed cocoa.
- So good!
- That is so cool!
- The kids are going to fight
over that in the morning.
- That is awesome.
- This is a good Christmas
gift, by the way. I love it.
- I got Bryan and Cullen and
me the never spilling mug
and I think I might get
them that this year.
- You give them mugs every year?
Those mugs were cool but you shouldn't
put them in the dishwasher 'cause it-
- Makes that steel go away.
- Dang it.
- Anyway, let's move on.
Let's move on to the next one.
This is not a poop emoji.
- I don't know what this is.
- Do you know what this is?
I'll give you one guess.
- Did I get it or did you get it?
- I got it for you. Let me
know in the comments down below
before proceeding further in the video,
what you think this is.
- Sleeping bag. Jacket.
- Let's open it up.
Ready to hear the air come out?
(air rushing)
Holy cow, it expands.
- What is it? What? There's hands.
Is that a belly button? Or a nipple.
- No it's a nipple.
- What is this?
- Did you get this for
me for the airplane?
- No, well not necessarily
for the airplane.
It's a lot smaller than I thought.
- What did you get it for?
- This is a cuddle buddy.
- Calvin might like it.
- If you want to cuddle with someone.
- Aww.
- There. That's 'cause my arm keeps
falling asleep when we cuddle.
It actually might be good on the airplane.
You know, when we were traveling one time,
I saw, you know how they have
the neck pillows like that,
they're just really small?
I saw someone with, what are they called?
- Boppy.
- A boppy, like a giant
baby carrier thing,
around their head. It was hilarious.
- This actually I think we
should bring on the flight.
It actually might be really nice.
- Ellie, you just want to
play with his nipple. Stop it.
- He's like what the heck? There, there.
- In a realistic situation,
would you use this?
- Yeah, I'm really
thinking I should bring it.
The neck pillows on airplanes
really are not that comfortable.
I think we should bring it.
Where's the lip suckers?
- Sorry, I was sleeping.
- That's awesome. I
actually really like it
and we will use it.
Thanks. I think we will.
- Who comes up with this?
Like an actual, realistic-looking arm.
- Totes. It's like 11:30 at night
so I kind of want to use it now.
- It's modeled after my body, by the way.
Next up, we've got something fun, I think.
It's carbonated bubble clay mask.
- I'm a mask sucker. I like
to do masks on my skin.
So Jared thought this might be really fun.
I'm really wondering if there's a benefit
for it though or if it's
just for fun and games
'cause I'm looking at it and I
don't see any sort of benefits.
It's made in Korea. A lot
of Korean, so I can't read.
- Yeah, there's a lot of Korean on the box
but here's the thing is, is
there going to be anything
inside of it that's gonna burn our skin?
- Carbonated? It totally could.
- Oh geez, this could be bad.
Ugh.
Oh, that smells not bad.
- Not bad, decent.
- Another face item that we
have in a much smaller package.
If you can't tell what this
is, these are gold foil sheets.
Actual 24 carat gold sheets.
- No, it is not. I do not believe that.
If it was real 24 carat gold,
it would have been expensive.
- Maybe it is, I don't
know. These are so small.
- No, I remember seeing the cost.
- But there's 20 sheets and
they're just tiny little guys.
- I don't know if I believe
that it's really 24 carat.
I think it would've been
an expensive face mask.
- Do you think people would
just go on the internet and lie?
- Let me see how much it was.
- No. There's twenty sheets in here.
You put them on your
face like little squares.
It's another mask. So should we do
one person does the gold foil and
one person does the carbonated thing?
- Yeah.
K, so far I'm seeing larger masks,
so not these, and they're like ten bucks.
I don't believe that it's real 24 carat.
I think that's a lie.
- Who knows? Let's go put it on our face.
- I just gotta remove my makeup first.
- Sounds like sandpaper on my
face 'cause of my whiskers.
- Don't scrub too hard.
Don't want to hurt that precious skin
that you're putting 24 carat gold on.
- Do you think this will increase
the value of my face at all?
- Totes.
- Good. Money maker. You ready for this?
- Yes.
- So you have the
carbonated bubble clay mask
and I have the gold sheets.
- I'm just nervous it's
gonna burn my skin.
I'm really picky on what I use.
- Neither of us can read the
instructions on either of these.
- So this says about
five minutes from online.
- It just dissolved on my fingers.
- Maybe this will take my blackheads away.
- It's so like shreds.
- Glad it was cheap.
- There we go.
- Nice. Yeah, this isn't burning.
- That's a good sign!
- It's starting to foam
up. It feels good though.
- Does it? What does it feel like?
- It just feels cooling.
It's not, I thought
it would really burn my
skin. It feels really good.
It looks hard and complicated.
- It is.
- Do you feel anything?
Is it liquid under it?
- Nope. I don't feel anything.
- I don't understand how this is a mask.
It literally just
disintegrates the moment...
What even? And you
don't have to do it wet?
- No, I think that if it was wet,
it'd ruin everything even more.
- K, you have a lot of these.
I'm just gonna try one
on my hand real quick.
- They don't go very far.
- That is the weirdest thing.
- Do you think you could just..
- Ew, you are disgusting. Why
did you do that? Is it gross?
- (mumbling) It's supposed to be edible!
- It just tastes like paper?
It did say online they were edible
so he didn't just do that to be a weirdo.
Does it taste like anything?
- It doesn't taste like you
would want gold to taste.
You want gold to taste really good.
- I feel like I look
like Squidward a little.
Look at it, it's getting fuller.
This is kinda cool. I kind of like it.
I could feel that if I
left this on way long,
I feel like I need to
wash it of right now.
Okay, I thought I could
leave it on long enough.
I just, I feel like this.
I'm going to wash it off.
No, no. Look at my face.
- It's so fun looking. It looks so cool.
- I look like I gained ten
pounds. Look at my cheeks.
- With mine, it looks like I've taken
gum wrappers and just put them on my face.
Your mileage may vary when you get these.
I just washed my face and I don't
feel better or look better.
- I feel like my face,
especially right here, is so red.
I don't think that that would do
anything good for someone's skin.
I don't like that. Give me
the lips back. Wanna do those?
And for the product that we forgot about,
which actually could
have been the best one.
Is it a bra?
Is it underwear?
You can't really see in the camera.
It's butt implants. You can barely see it.
That's so weird to me.
- They're like butt pads.
- That's so weird.
- So this is if you want
your butt to be bigger.
- Fuller.
- And fuller. I think one
of us should try this on.
- I'm interested to see if it works.
- Alright, let's get a before picture.
So boop, there it is. I like it.
Here is the after.
- K, side profile.
- Whoa! Look at that pop.
- I've got a booty. So that is the pads.
I guess I could see how someone
would buy it if they were getting married,
wanted to fill out their dress, or...
I could see it. I would never wear it.
- Or if you have the
infamous nekenbum, which-
- No butt at all.
- There's no butt.
- And then there's me that has not really
a butt so our kids are just doomed.
- They're doomed. They're
doomed in the bum bums.
Last, but certainly not least, I know
how much you love the hot tub.
- I love the hot tub. I love baths.
I have a little anxiety right now because
it's 11:30 at night and I
haven't taken a bath today.
- But I figure we can bring the
hot tub into the bath with this.
- What? This is a luxury
bath turbo spa. Interesting.
- I just don't know how safe that is
because it's got to be
powered by something.
- Yeah, you can see the cord hanging
above the water in the picture.
- In the picture. Is that like
dropping a toaster in the tub?
- I think that's a dumb,
a bad... It's scary.
- It is kind of scary. Should we try it?
- Yeah.
- Okay!
- Once. You first.
- Once is all that we'll need.
Now in order to test
this last Amazon item,
we need to be in a little
bit more appropriate attire.
(dramatic music)
- What are we doing?
- Jared and I got these swimming suits
for the Landing's swim party, but we
thought they may be a
little inappropriate.
- So what are we doing with them on now?
- We're going there today though,
'cause we're getting in the tub.
- This feels weird having a swimming suit
on my body like this.
I'm not used to that.
- This is weird.
- This is so weird. I can't believe
we're doing this right now.
- I think people are gonna hate us.
- Either they're gonna hate
us or think we're funny.
- Jet stream and bubbles, jet stream.
- So there's some lines on here
and you're fill line, your
minimum and your maximum.
So your water has to be here.
So you put the suction cups on the wall.
That's good. Push.
- Okay.
- And we hit the on button.
(splashing)
- But it stays in one spot.
- Yeah and you can change the direction.
- The kids might think that's really cool.
I don't like this.
K, so if you rip your thumb
nail, you can switch the dial.
- Seriously. That's a little better.
- And it has bubbles and a stream.
- Does it feel like you're in the hot tub?
- No.
- I think it's more of a
hazard than it is enjoyable.
- For the work and possible
hazard, I don't love it at all.
Usually, it's nice when
you're in a hot tub,
to have the jet to lean on your back.
This is not, I don't, no.
- This is kind of weird.
- But I think the whole situation's weird.
- I'm more uncomfortable
than I want to be.
And I imagine that you're pretty
uncomfortable in this situation too, so...
- This is not your normal vlog.
We just thought that
this would be fun to do,
so Jared thanks for the
idea, coming up with it.
- Thanks for the idea
of the swimming suits.
It was your idea.
If you have any other weird Amazon items
that you would like us to try,
let us know in the comments down below
or send us an email or a
tweet or something like that.
We would love to try them.
- So far what was your favorite?
- Definitely the spinning mug.
- The mug was my favorite and
I do want to order another
so the boys can each have one.
- Yeah, actually that was pretty cool.
- What was the worst?
- The swimming suit.
- Well, we did buy these off
Amazon like seven months ago.
- Yeah. I would say the gold foil.
The foil was just like
what is this? What is it?
- 'Cause everything else
at least served a purpose.
- Even though they were terrible purposes.
- It could be useful. The
mask, I guess, if i just
looked more into it and understood what
it did to your skin,
maybe I would like it.
- Now, I know a lot of
you guys are dying for me
to get out of this suit and
I am too, don't you worry.
I am in the same boat as you.
So we're going to end this video.
Thank you so much for watching.
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.
If it was kind of weird,
still give it a big thumbs up.
-  See you tomorrow. Bye!
- Let's turn this back
on for the middle button.
