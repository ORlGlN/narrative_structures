- Ride the train?
-  Yeah, we're gonna ride a train!
You excited to ride the train?
- Ride train!
(cheerful music)
- Good morning everybody!
We are getting ready to go home today.
I have a new video that just went out.
It is a post workout smoothie.
Go check it out.
Jackson, I do have a
question for you though.
What happened last night?
- I got the rainstorm,
and I went upstairs,
and I cried for mom!
And there was a rainstorm
and I cried for mom.
And I hide under mommy's pillow.
And I was sneaking under there.
And I was not scared!
-  Good!
Oh my goodness.
Usually when the kids
cry, I wake up right away.
But for some reason, I was dreaming,
but I could hear you crying.
And then it was when you
got to the top of the stairs
and really cried
is when I heard you.
So I ran upstairs,
and there was lightning all over here,
it was windy, and it
was very scary for you.
- Yeah.
-  But we're good now, huh?
- Yeah, I was not scared
when I sneaked under your pillow.
- Good morning guys.
Today is the day that we
leave and we head home.
We've got all of our luggage here
ready to get packed in the van.
And I was thinking sometimes
it can be a bittersweet feeling
seeing all of your luggage like that.
Good sweet feeling
because it's finally time to go home,
get back into that normal routine,
bitter because yore leaving your family,
and you're not sure
when you're exactly gonna see them again.
But we had a great time
and I am excited to take the
boys on an airplane ride!
Woah there, partner!
Do you even know the speed limits?
Do you even got your license, buddy?
- You should put your
seatbelt on, let's go!
-  That's a good point.
Okay, drive us away buddy!
Just keep it in between
the lines, all right?
(cheerful music)
-  All right, can
everyone do the Maggie move?
(Ellie laughs)
-  I'm doing the Maggie move.
-  Maggie, show
them your best dance move!
Everyone's doing it!
Okay, we all gotta give hugs and kisses!
Say goodbye to our cousins!
- Plane! Plane plane plane!
- My family's so stinking cute.
The boys are holding hands.
- Plane!
- Do you see a plane?
- Yes. Plane plane.
- Do you know that we're gonna go on one?
We're at the airport!
-  Hold my hand, let's go!
-  You ready to get on an airplane?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well actually, we've got like two hours
before we're gonna get on the airplane.
We're super early to the airport (laughs)
(kids yell)
so I imagine there's
gonna be a lot of that
for the next two hours, Ellie.
- So we'll go gear up,
buy a Coke or something.
- Yes.
So the roles have reversed.
This time it was me who got checked.
Well actually, it was Ellie's bag.
She left a Gatorade in there.
Did you guys get caught?
- Yes, I did.
- Oh!
- I had a bottle of water
that I totally forgot about.
- See, okay, so it's not only me.
- So I took out Dad's Dr Pepper,
but I forgot that I had a
bottle of water in there.
(cheerful music)
-  Hey Jackson, is
that our airplane right there?
- Yeah!
-  Are you excited to go on it?
- Yeah.
-  Where should we go?
- Home!
 Yeah!
Did you hear that, mom?
Captain Jackson's taking us home.
- So glad there's no tears!
(Jared laughs)
- That's the captain.
-  That is the captain.
Don't you wanna be a captain too?
- No.
-  Do you wanna fly the airplane?
- No, I'm too small.
-  You are?
-  When you're older.
- Yeah.
- Give me your ticket.
-  Thank you.
Thank you, let's go bud!
- We're on the airplane!
-  We're getting on the airplane!
Are you gonna ask the
pilot if you can help fly?
- No.
(Jared laughs)
-  He is drifting.
He is drifting in your arms.
Thank goodness!
Okay Jackson, now's your chance!
Do you want to ask him
if you can fly the plane?
-  You wanna fly it?
-  Do you wanna go fly the plane?
- No!
(laughter)
- He says, I'm too little, I'm too little!
We're about to take off on
our first flight of the day.
It's the longest flight,
and I have a couple keys to success
for handling a flight
when you have two kids
that are a little ornery.
First key to success, dried fruit.
Second key to success,
pretzels with chocolate.
Third key to success, chewies.
Fourth key to success,
caramel M&M's.
Fifth key to success, more dried fruit.
Sixth key to success, a flight manual.
And naptime.
- It's amazing
how you can have a
conversation with somebody,
especially a toddler,
using your eyes.
So Calvin's asleep
and Jackson's kind of
trying to wake him up.
And I look at Jackson,
and I went...
And jackson went...
And I went...
And he went...
(Jared laughs)
And it was so funny,
and I just had to laugh
because it was totally
just all in the eyes,
but we had a conversation.
- Tell me something with your eyes.
- Show me that you're happy.
Show me that you're mad.
Yeah.
The boys had a great flight.
We are on to the next.
They're a little restless.
So am I.
Yeah, it's a good thing
we have a little layover.
They can get their legs moving.
- The movies were nice to have,
but Jackson has this game
that he always plays
on the iPad on Sundays,
like for church.
It's a puzzle, a number
game, a matching game,
and some other game.
It's all in one, and the kids love it, so.
That was fun.
On to the next flight.
- One down, one to go.
- (gasps) Are you okay?
- My nose!
Am I bleeding?
-  It hit your hat.
At the beginning of the trip,
everybody had so much
spunk and excitement.
The end of the trip, they
are not holding their bags
and they want daddy to pull them.
That's just what he is going to do.
How come you're so nice?
- Cuz I love my family.
Look how cute these guys are.
-  Isn't it funny how
at the beginning of the trip,
everyone's like, I'm excited,
I'm gonna pull my bag!
- I'm gonna pull my own bag!
Five minutes later,
expectations versus reality!
- Ride the train!
-  Yeah, we're gonna ride a train!
You excited to ride the train?
- Ride train!
-  You got him? (laughs)
- Yeah!
- Is this exciting?
- Yeah!
-  Here we go!
(cheerful music)
So Calvin ran into this
store three different times
and he was like, dog dog dog!
And we're just like what?
There's no dogs in that store, Calvin.
What are you doing?
And then we take a closer
look on the third time,
and there are these little
tiny stuffed animal dogs.
Like keychains.
- Just tiny!
- And he spotted them every
single time we passed by.
And we were like-- oh!
-  Oh, did we...
Are you okay?
(Jared laughs)
-  I could hear that.
So Calvin got that,
and then Jackson got a pillow,
but it's a Jackson Storm pillow,
so it's like a pet and a pillow.
So that will be nice for Jackson to have.
And he's been feeding grandma
and grandpa an ice cream cone.
Show us what you've been doing.
Can I have a bite?
Mmmm!
Thank you!
(babbling)
- Someone has too much
energy at nine at night.
Well I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.
The good news is we made it
off the plane safe and sound.
Everything was great.
The plane was smooth, the kids did great.
We made it to the van,
and the battery's dead.
We cannot start our van.
- Do we need some more gas?
-  Um, almost.
I think our battery's dead.
We just need to get a jumpstart, buddy.
- Jumpstart?
- Yeah, I think that's all.
I hope that's all.
If it's just a dead battery,
then that's actually
the best case scenario.
If it's something else,
then I have no idea what it would be.
- We need somebody to jump us.
- Well dad went downstairs
to go see if they have a battery
or if someone has jumper cables,
so we'll see.
Cross our fingers.
(quiet music)
-  Our help has arrived!
Yay!
(quiet music)
- Yes!
We got it to start!
Yay!
We made it home!
I have to be so quiet,
because everyone's asleep.
I wanted to give a quick story
of what happened.
So we got off the airplane,
we went to the car,
and I was trying to get
the clicker started,
and I was like what the heck?
I'm pretty sure we're on this floor.
We may be on the floor above,
as far as the parking garage.
Clicking and clicking
and nothing is happening.
And I was like I think
the van's right over here.
So I went there and nothing was going on.
I was like what the heck?
Tried opening the door
and nothing was happening.
I was like, oh crap, the
battery must be dead.
So while we're looking into it,
dad went downstairs to get
someone from the rent-a-car place
to see if they have jumper
cables or anything like that.
One truck ended up coming to help us.
For some reason the jumper cables
weren't doing the best thing,
and so he called another guy.
He's like, you know what,
I think this is so dead that
it needs something else.
So he called a third person to come up
and they used a generator to start it.
And this whole process
took just about two hours.
So we were in the parking
garage for about two hours
just because the battery had died.
And I think honestly,
a light was left on or
something like that,
or someone bumped the car
and the alarm went off
and just killed the battery.
And that's what it was.
For two hours though, that was crazy.
So we made it home, we're safe and sound.
We are so tired.
It's past midnight.
We are going to sleep.
We had a great time,
but that was kind of like the
worst part of the whole trip.
So thank you guys for watching.
