- How do you cut the boys' hair?
- Hey, little baby,
you're like a grapefruit.
-  Well do you like your dog
or do you like Penny dog?
- Tiny dog.
-  Tiny dog he says.
- We have made a monumental announcement.
Now this one's pretty heavy, okay,
so let's try it and do it slow.
- No big.
- You want, you want a lot?
Kay, let's lift it up,
we're gonna tilt it.
Slowly.
Good job.
- Big!
- Yeah. It is big.
What do you wanna twist it?
Look, you are such a good helper.
Good morning bud.
- Good morning dad.
- I love you.
-  I know you love me.
- You're such Han Solo.
Good morning dad.
I love you.
I know you love me.
- Over on my other channel
you guys have seen that
Bonnie and I have put out a makeup video
and a writing our diaries video.
And as I was getting
ready today I was like
I've gotta sit down and show
you guys what I've been doing
a little bit differently,
just the last like five days.
So I always use my Bobbi Brown
eye corrector under my eyes
and I've talked about this
Pure Hydrafluid before.
It's, to me it reminds me of
like a tinted moisturizer,
but it's extremely moisturizing,
that's why it's like a Hydrafluid.
I usually don't wear this alone.
I just will mix it in with the foundation
if I wanna make it a little darker.
So I picked up the shade light
and it still is not as
light as I'd like it.
But, I've been using this little bit.
Still my eyebrows, mascara, and blush,
and that's what I've been using.
But I just want to show the applying this,
because I've talked about it so much
but I've been wearing it on it's own, so.
Let's get ready guys.
I always shake it really well.
And it seriously is so dark.
Like, this is the medium,
and that's what I usually mix
to make my foundation a little darker.
But even the light is very dark.
I've had a lot of, like,
pregnancy hormones been going on
and this whole pregnancy if I get acne,
I've been getting a lot
of acne above my lip,
which has kinda been weird.
But I just put a little dot.
That's even way too much.
So I'm gonna touch one side of my face
and then I'm gonna do the other.
Rub it all in and it literally
is like a tinted moisturizer,
it's not gonna really cover my acne.
Can you hear my voice?
I like just woke up.
I'm like groggy still.
(playful music)
And that is just my
foundation, like I said
I wish it was a hair lighter
but just to give my skin
an even complexion that's
what I've been wearing
'cause it's super fast in the mornings,
just on days where I don't really wanna
like really get ready I just want
a little color and mascara
and I'm good to go.
This is what I've been
using and I love it.
But if I could have them
make a lighter shade
like a fainter shade,
that would be the best.
And I have a hard time
with tinted moisturizers.
Like the in-cosmetics has probably
been my favorite tinted moisturizer,
but sometimes I feel like it just
sits on the surface of my skin
so like when I touch or the
kids touch it like smears off
or it just doesn't blend
but this it like literally
is like lotion in a way.
And it like just blends into your skin, so
I've really liked it, but yeah,
I'm gonna do my neck a little bit too
'cause it's really white.
Oh Jared!
Oh Jared!
Do you remember the first
few weeks of my pregnancy?
- Did you get yourself a cheese bagel?
-  Yeah.
- And an orange juice?
- For, probably two or
three weeks in a row
Jared would go get me a freshly
squeezed juice with ginger
from Jamba Juice and then
he'd go get me a bagel.
And so today, in honor
of me being 23 weeks
I went and got us one, so we will
have a little breakfast together.
23 weeks!
- Are these weeks just like flying by?
-  Holy crapola.
- You're more than halfway.
We're gonna have a baby in less time
than you've been pregnant so far.
-  Baby's the size of a-
- Orangutan!
-  No.
- A peacock!
An Einstein bagel!
-  I had a brain fart, what is it?
It's a fruit, it's a fruit!
- Guava juice!
-  No.
A grapefruit, a grapefruit!
- A grapefruit?
Grapefruit's aren't that small.
- Yeah, that's how big he is.
- Hey little baby,
you're like a grapefruit.
I hope he's not as sour as a grapefruit.
-  Probably.
- My favorite color's blue.
- Mine is red.
-  Your favorite color's red?
Penny what's your favorite color?
-  Yellow!
- Jackson passed off
more letters at school.
Good job Jackson!
So Jackson has passed off
all his uppercase letters
and now he's working on
his lowercase letters.
And I found the cutest little
craft that I wanna make
next week with him to
help him with his letters.
But today I think we're just
gonna hang out, and we are
what are we doing?
- Painting.
-  Painting?
Do we have brushes?
-  No.
-  What are we
gonna use to paint with?
- Our fingers.
-  Okay.
Should you paint Calvin?
Do you wanna paint with your fingers?
Do you wanna paint with your paws Penny?
- It's red.
-  Wow.
Well they each have a ton of colors,
but they're sticking with their favorites.
Jackson's sticking with his
blue, your heart looks awesome.
Calvin, you're sticking with red, huh?
- Put it on my face.
-  Kay.
It's a good thing about baths.
(Jackson and Calvin giggle)
Well I would say you guys
did a very good paint job.
Calvin loved red, that's
about all he used.
Spring is not coming anytime soon in Utah.
And it is cold, and it is snowy,
and the last few days I'm just like
I've got to think of some
things that we can do inside
that will entertain them
a little bit more than
they're pretty happy to go downstairs,
they're happy to play with cars,
they're happy to watch shows,
but I'm just like we've gotta
do a few things to make it-
wipe your hand?
Good luck, you need a whole bath.
But I was like I gotta
think of some things to do
just to like let them, like, be
and like do something other
than what they've been doing.
So today is painting and like I said
I found the cutest thing.
-  Hey!
-  He doesn't want
you coloring on his face.
This is like washable, like, fingerpaint.
So I'm not really concerned.
So the last time I cut the
kids hair I had some people ask
how do you cut the boys' hair?
So I'm just gonna kinda like go through
and show you what I'm doing.
Oh 'cause and Calvin
doesn't like this on ever,
but I really need him to keep it on.
So, sometimes I offer shows,
sometimes I offer them to have suckers.
Really I don't care what they have
as long as they're sittin' still.
So, Calvin's here, I have never
used clippers on Calvin's hair.
I always use a comb and scissors
because Calvin's hair is so fine and thin.
Jackson's hair I've been using
clippers on his hair forever.
Jackson hasn't ever really
been scared of clippers
and I don't know if it's
because I introduced him
to clippers and haircuts
when he was six months old.
And Calvin has, whenever I cut his hair
I just hand cut around his whole head.
So with Calvin I get a cup
of hot water, I get a comb,
and I just sit here and I comb his hair
how I want it to lay.
So the front, I lay it down,
I'm trying to be soft 'cause
he has a scratch on his head.
And I just literally
just lay Calvin's hair
all the way down with a wet comb.
And Calvin is definitely not
as patient with his hair.
So I kinda have to work really fast.
With kids, you really only have
a few minutes to cut their hair.
So you have to work really fast.
I start around, I cut around his ears.
I cut his neckline because
he won't give me much time.
He'll be wiggly, and I wanna
get that done first thing
'cause that's like the
main part of the haircut
is to have the outer edge trimmed, for me.
So, that's where I just start.
Then I just try and distract them lots.
Calvin, what color is McQueen?
- Um, red!
- He's red?
- No he's black and red.
- Oh is he black right now?
- Yeah.
- Is it a game or is it a show Calvin?
- Um, game.
- It's a game?
- Mhmm.
- Oh.
- It's a show.
- So I just sit and ask
a hundred questions,
especially while I'm going around his ear
'cause that keeps him quiet.
This is the best you've ever been Calvin.
I start by the ear, and I figure
how much I wanna take off.
Which is probably, like, a
little less than half an inch.
And I take this off around his whole head.
So, I grab all the hair around his ear,
and I just follow that and take it
all the way around his head.
(funky upbeat music)
Okay, Calvin's getting super ansy,
so he is getting a sucker.
Do you wanna hold this?
- Mhmm.
- Kay.
And now I get to move on
to the top of his hair.
Okay, who else is loving
the beard on Calvin's face?
Who loves that?
You look like a man!
So with Calvin, I went around his hair
and I just, with my fingers
up and down, did a half inch
all along the sides and
the back of his hair.
So now that we're to the
top I'm just gonna lift up
and this front section he has an owie,
so I'm trying to be really careful.
But I'm gonna lift it straight up
and I'm just gonna do a tiny tiny bit.
Because Calvin's hair
doesn't grow very fast,
'cause it's curly, and
I want the top longer.
So I'm just gonna do a tiny bit.
And I'm just gonna
follow all along the top
and do the same amount on the top.
Usually he's like screamin' by now
saying he wants to be done, so
it really depends on the day.
And I went to hair school,
so like I know what I'm doing
and I can work pretty fast.
But like, if you're at home doing this,
it might just take you a few
times to like, get going.
Don't feel discouraged.
But less is more, like don't go in
and just start choppin' hair
because then you're gonna like
chop all their hair off.
I would suggest investing in
some thinning shears as well.
Especially Calvin's
hair, where it's curly,
it tends to get really thick right here
and it's hard to look like it's blended.
So, just around between the blending part
of going on the sides
to the top of his hair.
Right here gets really thick.
So I'm gonna pull my scissors
up, and I'm just gonna like
thin this little area a little
bit so it's not so full.
Can you put your hand out and feel it?
- No!
- Will you do it right here?
- Yeah.
- See, it doesn't hurt,
can you put your hand out?
We do this every time.
Put your hand out.
Let's see your hand.
Whoa.
Kay, can you look at your toessies?
Then we'll be all done,
we'll go boom boom and it'll be done.
See, boom, one more look down.
At your toes and we'll be done.
One more time, good job.
Good job.
Kay good job, see he gives me
two seconds to do his neck, so
I don't have much time to do it, so.
This is Calvin's hair.
You can see he does not
give me much time to do it.
He has natural wavy hair.
And I just scissor cut his hair.
Alright so Jackson's hair,
what I do is I use clippers on his hair,
and I use a number one on the sides
and then I just cut a
little bit off the top.
So with his hair, I like
to comb it all forward
and I like to figure out
where I like to part it.
'Cause that's usually about
where I bring the one up.
I bring it up just below that part
and I just kinda blend it to the part.
Some people like to bring it
all the way up to the part
and have it be a really harsh line.
I don't really love that as much, so
I'm gonna find a line and part it off.
(light playful music)
Alright so I just went with a number one
around Jackson's head.
So I'm gonna take my comb
and I'm gonna hold it
against his head and
I'm just gonna lift up
and it kinda stops where
those hairs stop and fall
and he has longer hairs and
that's what I'm gonna cut.
And I'm gonna keep doing that
all the way up until it's
blended on his whole head.
It'll blend all of that.
Kay, so after I cut Jackson's
hair I try and blend it.
That's where my thinning
shears are my best friend.
I'm going to go up and
do the thinning shears
to make it blended even more.
Now that I've cut his sides
and I tried to blend it the best I can
I'm just gonna go on the top
and just kind of cut his hair.
(light playful music)
- I'm done.
-  This is Jackson's
hair with a number one up.
I tried to blend it to the part.
The top is cut a little bit.
-  Hey Jackson?
Will you take a picture of me and mommy?
- Sure.
- Okay, come stand right here.
-  We never ask
him to take a picture,
I think this is so cute.
- Just like that so you
can see mommy's belly.
And I'm gonna run in there too.
Just hit that big white button.
So, just like that.
Did you do it?
You wanna do it again?
Do it again.
Good job, let's see.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Let's take a look.
(Jared laughs)
- Dad I wanna see.
-  Perfect Jackson.
-  Good job Jackson.
Oh there they go.
- Oh cute.
- There ya go, here, he took a bunch.
(light playful music)
(Calvin mumbles)
- I love when he gets down next to Penny.
He was like
"blah-la-lo-blee-la-lolo-bolo".
-  But he is going to
get his dogs is what he said.
- Oh, I'm glad you're here to translate.
- Ahh, wait.
-  Go get your dog Penny.
-  Drop it.
-  Drop.
- Are you tryin' to show
her your favorite dog?
Well, do you like your dog
or do you like Penny dog?
- Tiny dog.
-  Tiny dog he said.
I have been M.I.A. Missing In
Action the entire day today.
Some of you may be cheering "Yes Jared!".
Some of you may be saying
"Oh no, Jared, where have you been?"
I have been in my office.
And, as of right now, you guys should know
that we have made a
monumental announcement
that we have a brand new
custom clothing line.
Bollie.
bolliebrand.com go check it out.
But right now, as I'm filming
this, it is not announced yet.
So, I wanna show you a little something
that I'm doing to get ready for this.
We're making teasers, all
before we make the announcement.
And right now I have been in my computer
creating particles for the announcement.
You can maybe be able to
see it move frame by frame.
This is just a quarter of the quality.
But that is going to be a
particle animation for a teaser.
And it's been going for about 20 minutes.
I don't know what it is with my computer,
but it's been acting really slow lately.
So, I hope it can handle all of this.
Handle all of the big stuff, but
I have been in my office
since seven this morning
and it is now 6:40 pm.
So I think I'm going to call
it quits here pretty soon
so I can be with my family.
'Cause I have been in
the office all day long.
It's been great.
Oh no, is it good or bad?
- Um it's healing.
I think, I've been like
why does it hurt so bad?
All you can see, like, you can
see where they cut it all out
but it's bruised, it's
like really bruised.
So that's why it's been hurting.
But, it's getting better.
-  Good.
- To you guys, Bollie has
finally finally been announced.
And I just wanna let you guys
know that a lot of these items
and prints are a limited
time, we are not going to be
reprinting these same
prints for next time.
So if you guys wanna
check out our website,
you definitely can now.
I'm very proud of Bonnie,
Jole, Jared, and I and
they, tons of other people that have
been a part of it to make this work.
Just very very excited.
Thank you guys for
watching our video today.
The kids had so much fun painting.
They zonked tonight.
Haircuts was fun, I hope I
was able to film that okay.
Jared was gonna make it
all, like, very nice in film
but then he ended up he
was in his office all day
working on the website, so
I appreciate his help.
Thank you guys and
we'll see you next time.
Bye!
