- We're trying to get some food down us
before church starts.
Two things, today's a special day
Jackson and Calvin,
well I guess that's not special,
they won't be together anymore in nursery.
- I'm gonna be at a new class.
-  You're gonna
be in the Sunbeam class.
Yep, Jackson's in a new class.
- He's going to go away.
-  And Calvin, you
are gonna be in the class
and Jackson won't be there.
- Yeah.
- Hopefully that will go smooth.
Jackson is going to a new class
and last night was your
second night together
in the same room.
Do you want Calvin to stay in the room
or should he have his own room?
- Stay in the room.
-  Stay in the room?
You like sharing the room with him?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.
You know what, they did awesome.
They did so good.
Again, Calvin did wake
up once, like usual.
And Jared put him back in bed.
And he did really good.
So I think if we keep doing that,
it'll go really smooth.
Where it used to be, if we
put him back in his bed,
he'd be really sad, but
because he has Jackson there,
I think it is just a smooth transition.
And I was thinking about this today.
So Jackson is going into a new class
and I feel like the age
between Jackson and Calvin
is really good for Calvin.
Jackson has been such a good--
he's just like sitting there.
Jackson has been such a
good example for Calvin,
because Jackson warmed Calvin
up to nursery at church,
Calvin was left alone,
but he knew he had his brother there,
that kind of warmed him up.
And same with just like
lots of situations.
Jackson will be there to help him,
and it's really nice and encouraging.
Hey mister.
- Hi.
- He's a little stressed,
trying to get stuff ready for church,
but I don't know, I just
really like their age
and I think that Jackson, you
are such a good brother, huh?
- Uh-huh.
-  Teaching him
how to be a brother.
Where's your baby?
Who needs a baby when you have a car
that you can buckle?
-  That's just a car.
-  Oh your Batman, that works too.
(gentle music)
I got it in and we're all packed up.
Pack up and go.
- No, leave it up.
Go up.
- Okay I have to admit it,
I'm late for church.
But that's okay.
I've been preparing for this music time
that I'm doing today.
And I want to show you a little bit
about it before I go.
Sorry Ellie, you have both
the kids at church right now.
But we have these bells that we're going
to be using in Primary today.
And there's a song that we sing
and we have all of the notes
and the colors of the bells corresponded,
not carols of the bells,
colors of the bells,
that corresponds with it,
so every time we sing this word,
(bell rings)
the kids will play that song.
Wow, that's ringing in my ear,
that's pretty loud.
This might be pretty
hectic in Primary today
with all these kids and all these bells.
But it's gonna be a lot of fun.
That was my favorite thing as a kid
is when we did activities like this,
where we got up and did something,
rather than just sitting and singing,
getting up and doing and singing,
so I think that's gonna be fun.
We're gonna teach them a
couple more songs today,
so I'm pretty excited.
I like this project,
this calling that I have
in church, it's fun.
And now Jackson is in the
class that I'm teaching,
so that's gonna make it even more fun
and more exciting.
Like my little buddy's with me in class,
how cook is that?
Uh-oh, I haven't left quite yet.
Ellie took the kids in the car
and that leaves one other car,
but I can't find the keys.
So I have to scrounge the house
looking for the keys.
They're not where they normally are,
they're not in my coat pocket.
Oh jeepers.
What if I have to take the
four-wheeler to church?
That's not a bad thing.
That might be fun.
But it would might be very cold.
Oh jeez, please be in Ellie's purse.
Nope.
Oh great, okay.
How am I gonna get to church?
I'll figure this out, don't worry,
I'll get to church somehow.
I gotta be there soon, uh!
I have scoured the entire house
looking for these keys.
And I can't find them anywhere.
I can't believe I'm doing this,
but I think I'm taking the four-wheeler
to church today.
Pretty exciting, but it's
gonna be really really cold.
It's a good thing I have
this lock box on here,
because driving with paper like this,
is not the easiest or the smartest.
So I think everything should be safe
and sound in there, and dry.
That's the other key thing,
is that it should stay dry.
Okay.
What an adventure we're having
and it's only Sunday.
(bright playful music)
(four-wheeler revving)
(snow scraping)
(yells)
It's cold.
It's cold, but it's beautiful today.
And it's foggy.
Oh wow, look at the fog.
Woo.
Oh it's slippery too.
(laughs)
This is fun, this is exciting.
Oh my face is frozen,
but my hands are warm.
I got hand warmers on the four-wheeler,
so that's pretty nice.
And now we just walk
nonchalantly in to church,
as if nothing is different,
as if nothing is out of the ordinary,
except I'm a little bit late.
I didn't drive my four-wheeler to church,
that's absurd.
One nice thing about church today,
is that we changed times,
and we're at nine o'clock
instead of one o'clock,
so we'll be out at 12, which is nice--
Whoa, I was late getting to church,
and I'm actually late
coming home from church,
mostly because there was a truck
in the parking lot that thought
that they would just block me in,
so I couldn't back out.
So that took an extra 20 or 30 minutes
for me to get home.
I don't know if they did
it on purpose or not,
but they blocked me in,
and I couldn't ride over the front way,
because there was a four foot wall.
But we're home from church.
Ellie is working on her bullet journaling.
Why do they call it bullet journaling,
because this is not as
fast as a bullet, Ellie.
This is taking a long time.
- Well I'm doing it really slow.
- It looks fun.
It looks almost therapeutic
taking the time
- Well it's fun.
- To do it, so.
- It's fun.
- And once I get it all sketched out,
it'll be easy to do.
I'm just making it essentially.
- Yeah.
But I wanted to tell
you about church today.
So you guys know that I do the music
and this is Jackson's time being
in the music class with all of the kids.
I was talking to all these kids,
I'm like this is what
we're gonna do today,
we're gonna sing and have so much fun.
I was talking to everyone
and Jackson was responding
as though I was just talking to him
and it was so funny.
Because I would say okay,
this is the song that we're
gonna sing today guys,
and Jackson says,
Dad I don't want to sing that song.
And everyone, all the teachers,
are laughing like crazy.
And then we have these bells
that I was showing you earlier
and Jackson, it's so funny,
he always says how time,
instead of what time.
And he says how time are
we gonna play these bells?
Like what time are we gonna
play these bells, Dad?
And everyone is just
bursting out laughing.
It was so fun
but all in all,
I think the kids had a
really great time at church
in their new classes today.
I have fun teaching the kids.
Let's go ask 'em.
Hey Jackson, did you have
fun in your class today?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
What was your favorite
part about class today?
- Singing.
- Ah, I didn't even have to tell you
to say that!
You're my favorite first-born son.
Calvin, did you have fun at church today?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
What was your favorite part?
Was singing your favorite part?
- Yes.
- Oh, it was.
Oh you're my favorite second-born son.
I love you.
- Whoa, Dad?
(drill whirring)
- Is that pretty cool?
-  Whoa, we are getting ready
for somebody's birthday.
- Yeah.
- My birthday!
- Who's?
- Mine.
- Yours?
-  Are you gonna be three?
- Mine.
- No four.
- Four?
Holy cow.
We are getting ready
for Jackson's birthday.
We are wanting to make sure
that the basement is tidied.
These chairs have been loose
for a really long time,
so Jared's getting the drill out.
Just getting everything situated.
We have a birthday on Tuesday.
- I feel like we have
a brand new basement.
Like I went through the
entertainment center
and cleaned everything out,
worked on all the cords in the back,
- Amazing.
- it just feels good.
-  I'm sorry, but the more things
you put by Penny,
she's not gonna eat.
-  Don't put it past her Ellie,
she may eat that metal thing.
Calvin, he keeps going
and grabbing random stuff,
putting it by her.
And then touching her
head, so she'll eat it.
First off I have to give you guys
a huge thank you.
When Jared asked you guys to participate
in the survey last week,
it really meant a lot to us,
because we really want to know what you
want to see in the vlogs.
And we have some ideas
of what we want to do,
but it also helps to have an actual survey
of the amount of people
that want to see this
or don't want to see this.
I'm sorry Jared,
no one voted for the tech and reviews,
but I told him, if he
still wants to do it,
he really should, because
that's the point of the vlog.
But we just know what you
guys would rather see.
And we definitely take into consideration
what you guys want to see when we do film.
So really thank you so much
for filling that out,
which kind of leads in to this.
A lot of people have been saying,
Ellie do a video on your bullet journaling
and I just want to sit down a few minutes
and talk about my bullet journaling.
And what I've been doing,
and also with the vlogs,
I used to feel like oh I
don't want to sit and talk
for four or five minutes,
because then that's like half the vlog,
and I want to take myself
out of that mindset
of a vlog has to be every
day, morning to night.
Maybe in the morning I want to get ready,
maybe I want to talk about my nails,
maybe I just want to talk about the kids.
It's a weird thing that I've put on myself
and maybe it's just
because I've watched vlogs,
so I think oh this is the
way maybe we should follow,
but I definitely want to
take into consideration
this year, because so
many changes are coming,
baby is coming.
My energy might totally plummet,
it already has,
but I've enjoyed it.
I've really enjoyed just--
I'm kind of a homebody,
so I like that, but--
Yeah, bullet journaling, so
many people have asked about it.
I am a beginner.
If you guys really want
to watch videos on it,
YouTube it up guys.
So many people have so
many awesome suggestions
on how-tos, but I'm just gonna give you
a little bit of what I've been doing.
First, I ordered this from Amazon.
I also saw it at Hobby
Lobby the other day,
it's Hand Lettering 101.
I've showed you guys,
a lot of people have
asked where we've got it.
And then so many guys have
tweeted me pictures of you,
and yours, this is some of my drawing.
It's seriously been so fun for me
to sit at night,
and just focus on something, not my phone,
but just drawing, it
really been therapeutic.
But my goal for the last few years
is to do better at my handwriting
and I feel like this is the start of it.
Bullet journaling in a sense is,
you make your own planner / journal,
instead of buying one that's
already sketched out for you.
It's very what you want in your planner.
And I love planners, I have to have them.
And every planner is so different,
like I said, do what works for you.
And I'm not artistic.
But this is my first page,
it's my goals for the year
and my goal is peace,
I just want to feel
very peaceful this year.
And feel peace at my decisions or yeah,
so peace is that.
And then I have (laughs),
this is called the future log.
Because what happens if the family says
hey, there's a family reunion in July,
but I don't write out my full year
in the bullet journal.
So this is just a future log,
where it can say,
oh this is the days,
like we have a cooking day
on the 17th of January,
so I write that down.
So it's just things
that you can write down
ahead of time so you can look back on
and know what's going on.
I have a video file.
I have some really fun plans
for my channel that you
guys are going to see
at the very end of the month.
When I went to China,
a lot of things that happened there
are going to come to fruition,
a lot of my knowledge is coming out,
that I've been working on.
So I'm definitely gonna
be doing more videos.
They may not quite be like
what I've been doing in the past,
but I'm really excited for that.
And then so far I have,
right after that is my week.
So this is a movable tab, that I'll move
when I have a new week.
Okay, I am so learning.
I thought Jackson was turning three.
(laughs)
So I was like three plus one.
Okay so this is my week ahead.
This week I don't have much on there.
I have a chiropractor appointment,
I have a doctor appointment.
So that's that week and
then I have the next week
of January 14th to the 20th,
again I have a photo shoot,
then I have a cookbook
day with the family.
Yeah, so pretty much
I'm just writing out the weeks as I go.
Some people have a month
that they write out
and then the weeks, but
I don't want to do that,
because I already have
the months written down
to reflect back.
So really it's just
what you want it to be.
It's therapeutic.
It's fun, it's my goal to
get better handwriting.
So it's been fun to just sit
and take my time.
And I've really enjoyed it.
I think it's gonna be really fun for me.
It's been fun with the kids.
They just see me sitting.
And I'm like this is what
I'm doing for the hour kids,
and so I end up pulling their stuff out
and they color and draw,
and run around the house
and watch shows.
So everything that I got for myself,
I also got from Amazon.
So I looked up a lot of books
of what people use.
And know even gonna know how to say it,
the Lechtrum?
Leuchtturm book?
I don't know.
I'm gonna have everything
that I've used so far
in the description, but
if you guys use stuff
that you think I need, let me know.
That is just a little life update
and my favorite thing that
I've been into lately.
Thank you guys so much for asking
and wanting to hear about it for so long.
Like I said, I'm a newbie.
There are some really fun people
that actually do painting
and they put their paints in here.
So many fun things.
Like I said I'm not artistic.
My goal is just to be very simple
and then when I get into
it and feel comfortable,
then I'll get on the artsy side.
But for now, I'm not gonna do that.
So that's what I have.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
We really appreciate it.
I love what we do.
I think this is so fun.
You kids, you guys are done for the day.
Jared I called you kids,
because I'm used to saying kids.
- It's okay, I'm happy to get on playing--
-  You guys are done for the day.
Penny girl.
- She's been so good for us today.
- You've been good the last few days.
Last week was a little crazy and rough,
(laughs)
it was just a little crazy and rough,
but she's been so good this week.
It's like kids, one week they're good,
one week they're crazy.
So thank you guys so much for watching
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Jackson's birthday week guys!
- Woo!
