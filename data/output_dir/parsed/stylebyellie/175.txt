and seeing a lot of great things.
The kids are wearing their costumes
and they are just adorable.
Calvin, are you dressed up as Woody today?
- Woody.
-  Yeah.
Are you excited to go

Uh-oh we're locked out.
So I know that you have seen the room,

So that is what I'm gonna do right now.
You guys just saw what it
looks like on the outside.
It's gorgeous, it's amazing.
But I want to show you this.
You just got like a cool desk feature
with lots of storage space, drawers,
a TV, a giant mirror.
Then we've got this couch that folds
yeah, it's a cool bed.
It's a couch that folds down into a bed.
And as you saw,
- That one turns into a ladder bed.
-  That's right, this comes down
into a bunk bed.
Is that where your slept?
- Uh-huh, I slept up there.
- That is so cool.
-  Yes you did, did you like it.
- I want to sleep up there.
-  Yeah.
Then, this is our bed,
which is super comfy.
Got a couple lights over there.
Underneath the bed is plenty
of storage for suitcases.
We've got a couple doors
right here, I'll show you.
The first one is like a
- Is a shower.
-  Yeah, it's a shower with also,
there's like a tub,
so you can bathe the kids inside of there.
You can get ready in here and everything

Then we've got this one right here.
Oh hi.
- That one's the toilet.
- Hello.
-  Oh eww, hi.
- Come in here.
-  This is the toilet room.
And for how like

And then two right here, half size

All in all, I'm super

Okay, let's go this way.
- It's sparkly down here.
-  It's sparkly down here.
Look at the floor.
Hi five friend.
This is our awesome waiter this week.
He's so nice.
- He is so nice and awesome.
- It is formal night,
so we are all dressed up.
And we are here.
Everybody is arriving.
- I'll put you here.
-  Perfect.
- There's a screen very close to it.
- Nice.
- Perfect.
- You are awesome.
- I put the kids in the corner,
so they can see the shows and everything.
- This is our table.
The Disney cruise is
absolutely so organized
and every, there's details everywhere.
And what has amazed me is
how clean everything is.
They don't allow kids or even adults
to walk into the dining area
without washing your hands.
There are stations all over the cruise
to wash your hands.
They keep it very clean.
You can come.
Say hi to the world.
- Hi.
- Hi.
(laughs)
- Yeah everything is very clean.
- Chocolate milk.
-  Yes, say thank you.
They knew that the kids
love chocolate milk.
So we have the same
waiter for the whole week
and he is awesome.
- Hi.
- See?
-  How awesome is he?
Thank you.
- Check out the menu Ellie.
Look at this.
Does it show?
- So fun.
-  Yes.
-  Don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
-  Not quite, oh it worked.
(laughing)
-  Made it.
-  Got him.
- What just happened?
-  If you're totally ready
to have a righteous time
with the cross man, say cha.
-  Cha.
-  Who's that?
- A fish.
- We have the same hair color dude.
Quite nice, yeah, turtle wax, nice nice.
- It's like a theater that people stand on
and they sing and they dance
and they act out a play.
Do you know what play we're gonna go see?
- Yeah.
- It's called Aladdin.
- At a movie theater?
- It's kind of like a movie theater,
but it's people actually
moving and dancing.
It's not a screen, it's
people, real people.
That's the thing about this Disney cruise,
we've only been here
for like one full day,
two days, this is our
second day on the boat,
and I've been trying to figure out a way
to describe how we've been feeling,
how things have been.
And honestly, magical is the best way.
Everything from the waiters at dinner
to the room, to the activities,
it's just been magical.
And we're gonna go see a play,
it's this first play of the night
and it's Aladdin.
- Are we going somewhere?
-  Yeah, we're
gonna go watch the play.
Guess what?
There's a genie in this one.
- Uh is there a boy prince
and there's a princess of the girl?
-  Yes that's right.
- Why is it called that?
- The boy's name is Aladdin.
- No it's the prince.
-  Well he wants to be a prince.
That's the whole story.
Let's go, high five.
One two three.
-  Tra la la!
- Are we having a good
family Mecham vacation?
- Yes.
- Okay, one two three.
(howling)
(laughing)
-  You got your popcorn?
- Yes.
- This is beautiful.
- This is beautiful.
This is the stage.
Look at this.
It can fit tons of people.
- Where should we sit?
- I think we should sit
up front on the higher.
- -Ellie] Okay.
-  We're out of here.
- We are just sitting here on the veranda.
I feel so weird saying that, veranda.
- The kids are watching the show
like they do every night on the bunk bed.
- It's so sweet to see
them on the bunk bed
just watching, like how cute is that.
But we are admiring the beauty of nature.
There's a thunderstorm
just miles and miles away
and we've been sitting
out here watching it.
And we want to show you
a little bit about that,
before we end the night.
Woo.
Come on, give me a good one.
-  That's it.
- That was such a tiny one.
So tomorrow morning is
our first day at port
and we're so excited.
We've got a beach day
with the whole family
and we cannot wait.
Ellie, so far on the scale of one to 10,
how would you say this cruise has been?
- This has been by far a 10.
I'm trying to think of like
the sweetest moments today,
there were so many.
- I think the kids meeting the characters
was like the funnest part.
- And walking around in their costumes
and everyone awing over them.
Everyone thought they were so cute.
- People wanted their autographs.
It was so fun.
Gosh Aladdin was great too.
Oh of course, there was
a really great thunder
and lightning strike
and we just missed it.
- The kids absolutely
loved the live Aladdin.
Calvin just stood there
the whole time and pointed
and loved it.
- Yeah exactly.
- I just aww, our kids are so sweet,
it's been amazing.
And they both slept in the
bunk bed all night long.
- Which is huge for us.
This is a huge improvement.
- We all slept 'til 9:00 AM.
It was crazy.
- Unheard of.
- So tomorrow.
- Tomorrow
- we're gonna try and repeat that, okay?
So thanks for watching and
we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
(gentle guitar music)
