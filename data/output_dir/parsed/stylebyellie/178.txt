(bright guitar music)
- Well look who decided
to get out of bed today
and get dressed.
I'm out of bed.
It supposedly snowed
today up in the canyon.
It's raining.
Today is cold, it is fall
and it actually feels kind of fun and cozy
to be inside.
I'm getting dressed and ready for the day.
Because I feel like getting ready
and I want to try Bonnie's
curling iron again.
So that's what we're doing.
We're up for the day.
- It's chilly.
- Up and at 'em.
- It's chilly.
-  Hi.
Bonk.
Oh Calvin, don't bonk your head on that.
You are so crazy.
Hey,
bonk.
(laughing)
Calvin, are you ready?
I've got your shoes and your socks.
- No no.
- You know what?
- You don't want,
- I said Calvin, do you want
to go play with Lincoln?
- Not.
- He's hiding his toy, saying it's mine.
-  Awww.
Hey, let's get your
shoes and socks on okay?
- I'll go with you.
-  Do you want to go?
- You want Mommy to go too?
-  Look at his handsome hair.
I love his hair when
it's like pushed over.
Let's get on your shoes,
here, come here.
- Mommy.
-  You want Mommy
to put your shoes on?
- This hair.
- Is that her hair?
- Mommy's hair is pretty too?
-  Is her hair pretty?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  Aww.
- Okay, let's put your shoes on.
- So I was in the living room,
trying to get Calvin's shoes on
and he said, no, Mommy shoes.
And I was like you want
Mommy to put on your shoes?
And he said uh-huh,
and I said, no, I'll put your shoes on.
He's like nooo, and ran in here.
(laughing)
I wanted to see if he would say it again.
- You're a pill.
- You are a pill, a handsome pill at that.
- We're gonna go to Aunt Bonnie's,
and you're gonna play with Lincoln.
-  Yay.
He says mine again.
Don't be a little
-  Don't be a silly ragamuffin.
- We gotta share.
-  We share our toys, kay?
Lincoln's gonna share his toys
and you can share your toys.
Sound good?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, good boy.
-  Look at the
snow on the mountain.
-  No!
(Ellie laughs)
(banging piano)
- Wow.
The first time Calvin did
that and it made noise,
he looked at me and he went,
as if he did something bad.
- Mine mine mine mine mine.
-  Well you know what Lincoln?
That's what Calvin said, when I said
we were gonna play with you.
He said mine mine mine mine mine.
(laughing)
So I'm glad both of you boys are selfish,
and not just one.
- Mine, mine!
-  Hey, I'm here to
borrow your curling iron again.
You're not selfish, we share.
(laughing)
I just got done curling my hair.
A lot of people asked questions
about what it was last time.
It's the Beachwaver, I'm
sure they have a website,
if you google one.
I'll try and find a link somewhere
to have it in the description.
But, thank you Bonnie.
- You're welcome.
- I really like it.
-  It's cute.
Do you feel like it's a different curl?
- I feel like it's a different curl.
-  Yeah, I do too.
- I don't know how the back looks,
but I bet it's kind of fun and cute.
I just have to spray it.
Thank you.
I feel
- Yeah.
- I feel good today.
- You look good today.
- My eyes are still like
tired, but I feel good.
(laughs)
-  Oh jeez.
Oh jeez.
- Two three four
-  Oh no!
Okay okay, that was good.
I think every kid has done this at least
one point in their life,
at least until something happens.
I'm kind of nervous, I don't
want to watch this happen,
but ahhh!
(laughing)
Oh jeez, why don't you guys
do it more in the middle,
so you're not so close to that corner,
that makes me nervous.
This whole thing makes me nervous,
but I know you guys
are having so much fun.
- Fight!
(laughing)
- Hey boys, why don't we
quit while we're ahead?
No one's injured, we had a great time,
let's be done.
No?
Oh good.
(laughing)
- Go!
(laughing)
- Oh, down for the count.
Now Jackson, if you want to win,
you got to get low.
You gotta be lower than the person, kay?
Use your center of gravity.
Get down in there, dig deep.
Dig deep.
(laughing)
- Ow.
- You got him.
You didn't even have to run.
Ready?
You run hard
and you run fast.
- One, two.
-  Go!
- Go!
-  You guys are so strong.
(Jared laughing)
- When it comes to vlogging,
what we really try and do is
show you what we are doing
rather than tell you what we are doing.
I would say today is just a little fail,
because I am telling you what I did
rather than show you what I did.
We did put some fall stuff up,
so I'm gonna show you around the house.
When you walk in, we have a
few fall pillows right there.
I'm not a huge decorator,
I'm getting there.
On this wall, I want to get a bunch
of picture frames and do
two rows of picture frames
of the family, the kids, grandparents.
- Was I a good Vanna?
-  You're so good.
And then of course, my
friend just painted that.
-  I still love it.
-  I will have her
Instagram in the description.
She's so, I love her.
On this little stand (laughs),
we have been able to keep
this little plant alive for
-  Since we moved in, right?
-  Yes, almost a year.
- That's crazy.
We've been in our house for almost a year.
- Yeah, so that plant, I'm
proud, that we have not killed.
Anna Anderson painted
that for me last year,
so that has that on it.
This over here I got from
Hobby Lobby this year.
My friend gave me this,
with not this miscarriage
but my last, and I was so sad,
when I killed it, and I almost cried.
I don't know why it meant so much for me,
but it really did when she gave it to me,
and it came back alive and I was so happy.
So that's the plant that she gave me,
so I love that.
A sweet viewer made this for us,
so that's that stand.
I haven't really done that
much up there for fall.
For Christmas, I usually do.
This I'm in love with.
I got this from Hobby Lobby this year
and this is a heavy
stone from Hobby Lobby.
And then my friend Anna Anderson painted
that last year for me, so.
- This is so like
-  I love that.
- It's like deceiving,
because you think it's one
of those hollow pumpkins, but it's like
(knocking stone)
-  It's heavy.
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- Owie, that hurts me
-  just thinking about it,
so there's that, right there.
Whoa, it's heavy, you want me to help you?
Whoa.
And then, this I thought
was cute for fall.
I have a few plants in there,
and down here, I'll put
some fall stuff later
when I get something for
that, so there's that.
Okay, now for the fun of
fall, I will show you.
I got all of this last
year when we moved in.
And it's very simple, but it's
very warming and welcoming.
So all of that was from
Hobby Lobby last year
and the pillows were from Target.
So pillows are on the couch,
and the fireplace is done.
So pretty simple, but that's
what we have for fall.
And I like it.
- I love this down here.
- Yeah, it looks really
different down here,
but it's not like so crazy.
The thing about fall
in Utah is I don't feel
like there's a really great transition
from summer to fall.
It's just like
- Right away.
- Yesterday or the day before,
it was like 90 degrees and today
it's like boom, 60 degrees.
It's chilly.
- I think it's actually been 55.
- It's chilly outside.
- It's chilly.
- It's chilly.
- It's chilly.
- It's been a cold one today.
I mean so cold that Mr. Jackson
had to take off his shirt.
Why have you been taking
your shirt off lately?
- Because I needed to.
-  Because you needed to?
Why, were you too hot?
- Yes.
-  Wow.
-  Well sometimes
Mommy is a little cold,
and you know what we do when Mommy's cold?
I'll show ya.
- What?
(beeping)
-  Yeah, I turned that
bad boy on this morning too.
You look like a big boy
with your little underwear
sticking out and your shirt off.
Welcome to the family Leo.
- We got a new puppy!
-  Aren't you so cute?
- Is he like our puppy?
- Look at this.
-  It's not quite ours,
but they said we can use him
whenever we want.
Use him as in play.
(laughing)
-  Use him for
titles and thumbnails.
- Hi Dallen, you guys have
seen Dallen so many times.
He has helped us film some of our
really big, fun videos.
- Best videos.
- And he has his girlfriend here,
hi pretty girl.
- Hi.
-  Hi Leo.
But this is the one we're
focusing on the most.
So cute.
-  Let's get a family picture.
Aww how sweet.
- One two three cheese.
-  Cheese, cheese.
This is so fun.
- This is fun.
Date night.
- So if you don't know
- Dallen and I are longtime friends.
And we're having dinner together.
So this is a lot of fun.
- Thai food.
- Usually we're working together.
- Yeah, now we're just relaxing.
- Yeah, we're enjoying
each other's company now.
-  Calvin.
- Look who just wok up.
-  Do you want
to go see that puppy?
- Do you want to see a puppy?
-  Go look at the puppy.
-  Mom has the puppy.
- I got it right here.
He's licking his face.
(laughing)
Look at the puppy,
He's like I just woke up.
- It's a puppy.
He wants to say hi.
-  He is so happy.
- Hi.
(barks)
He is so tired still.
- Do you want to see the
puppy, okay goodnight.
- Okay, should we go back to bed?
- Uh-uh.
- Oh you want to stay up now?
- Isn't he so cute guys?
- He likes you.
- Oh he likes that.
-  Look at that.
What a fun treat.
I want to wake up everyday
to a puppy in my face.
I do.
She's 60 pounds.
(laughing)
- Do you remember when we got bad news
about Jackson and all of your co-workers
brought puppies over to our house?
-  It was Calvin, yes yes.
- Was it Calvin?
It was Calvin.
-  Yeah I was five weeks with him.
And all my co-workers
brought puppies over.
- Puppies over to make her feel better.
- It was the best.
- Like seven puppies.
- It was the best.
-  That's so cute.
-  That's the coolest
thing I've ever heard.
-  It was really sweet.
Her dog had just had a puppy.
- I'll have a link
to that video in the iCard.
-  And now I'm
gonna get you another one.
- Jared said you pet the puppy
before you eat the licorice
standing right there.
- He's a good dog, huh?
Did he lick you?
-  Did it look like a rug?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
-  Calvin has definitely warmed up,
won't leave the dog alone.
You like that little puppy?
He's not like Penny.
Penny likes to like romp around.
He's just new, so he
sleeps still all the time.
- Calvin.
Did you wake up to a new puppy?
(laughing)
that's the best way to
wake up every night, huh?
-  I would like
to wake up to a puppy.
- I think everyone in the world
would like to wake up to a new puppy.
-  Say goodbye to the puppy.
- Okay bye bye.
-  Kisses.
- Oh.
(laughing)
-  Are you whispering in his ear?
Whisper.
- Tell the puppy a secret.
-  Tell him a secret.
- Tell him something.
(laughing)
-  And Miss Penny
and the new little puppy.
- They're just different
sizes, that's all.
-  They're different sizes.
We tried to do a little introduction and
the little puppy was very nervous.
You would've been good,
but she was just nervous
because you're so big.
- You were just so excited.
- She is big.
- Penny is almost a year old
and she is 60 pounds.
- Yeah, probably 60 pounds by now.
Good girl, you're such a big girl.
You're a good girl, huh?
Let me rub you again,
let me rub you again.
(laughing)
(Jared yells)
(groans)
- Why is it always me?
-  Now she's excited.
- She's doing zoomies.
She's doing zoomies.
(laughing)
-  She is, Penny girl.
She's acting.
(laughing)
She's excited.
Penny.
Look at her.
(yelling)
(signal tone)
-  Okay.
What was that all about?
- Down.
- Huh?
-  Down.
- Down.
Penny, down.
Good girl.
- She was totally excited.
-  She was doing zoomies.
- Down.
Oh my gosh.
- Down.
-  Down.
- Good girl.
- Good girl.
- That was hilarious.
-  And intense.
- She knew we were laughing.
Like she knew that that was funny.
- I'm sorry to tell you,
but I'm not sure if we'll be able
to have any more kids after that.
She got me right where it counts.
- That's not funny.
- I know it's not funny,
it hurt really bad.
-  Jared always
gets hit in the crotch.
- It's like a family joke.
It always happens to me
and it's the worst.
(laughing)
I'm sitting here in my office,
just holding back the tears right now.
I'm watching America's Got Talent
and Evie Clair is singing right now.
If you guys remember from CVX Live,
we were lucky enough to meet her.
She was one of the talent there
at CVX and she's just the sweetest.
And so she's singing
in the finals right now
and if you guys didn't know,
her dad passed away last week
and just like holy cow,
I can't even imagine
what she's going through
right now, but she's up there on stage,
and it's very sweet to see her do that,
because she's doing such
a great job right now,
it's incredible.
But Evie, we're thinking about you
and your family right now
and hope you guys are doing okay.
Gosh that was good.
We've said this a lot
in the past few days,
there's so much going
on in the world today
and so many troublesome things
so many natural disasters,
so many hard things that
people are going through
right now and we just want to let you know
that we are thinking of you
and we're praying for you in each
of your situations.
We hope that you're doing good.
So with that, it's time to end the night.
So thank you for watching.
We appreciate you.
We're grateful for your support.
And we will see you
guys tomorrow, bye bye.
