-  He stepped over it!
He stepped over it!
-  Get back up, son, get back up!
-  So, does this
mean we're gonna have
a ton of eggs for breakfast?
-  Yes.
-  Good morning.
Happy Easter weekend!
- Happy Easter weekend to you guys.
-  We are getting
ready to do something fun
with the kids later, so
we are gonna use that
to have scrambled eggs.
- Lots of them, so I hope you're hungry.
- I got ready today and I feel
a little out of my element.
I think these are so cute on other people
but I don't know how it looks
or if I'm wearing it right.
- I think it looks adorable on you.
I really do.
I like your bun, and I like your buns.
- Thank you, but this is my outfit.
We're getting ready to
do an Easter egg hunt.
We've got the kids' outfits ready.
They're wearing bugs today.
Are you excited to wear bugs?
My little super heroes.
- There they are.
-  There they are.
Do you see all the people coming over?
-  Yeah.
- There are tons of
people here at the park,
which is a good thing
because when we drove up,
we were just like, "There's no one here."
And we were looking at the
wrong entrance of the park.
So, we've got our buckets and we are ready
to go find some eggs.
Are you ready to rock and roll?
- Yeah.
- Can you show them your bucket, Jacks?
-  Yeah, who's on your bucket?
- Uh, Spiderman.
- Spiderman, and then
Calvin has Ninja Turtles.
Calvin is just waking up.
You ready to go find some eggs?
- Yeah.
- You know, I remember
doing Easter egg hunts
and I remember one year, we
did it, the church had one,
so we did it and I
remember the lady was like,
"You can only grab three."
and I was like, "What?"
and everyone was grabbing
tons and I just grabbed three
and I was so sad.
I told my mom and my mom's
like, "Who told you that?"
and then I told her and she's like,
"You should've grabbed more."
(Jared laughs)
Trying to be, you know.
- Yeah, trying to make
sure everyone gets one
and then you were being a good kid.
- But no one did.
They all just grabbed tons.
- They're all just ignoring it.
That's funny.
Little does he know that
this week we're going to Disneyland.
Say, "Oh boy, Mickey Mouse."
(inaudible)
(Jared laughs)
Jackson, your head went
all the way through.
Can you get it back out?
Is your head stuck?
- No.
-  Okay.
-  Let's put Calvin in there.
- Let's let Calvin try, okay.
Hop on out.
Calvin, come say hi.
Say hi to me.
Hi.
There you go.
So, this is a pretty cool thing.
They've got it divided up into age groups,
so this field right here is
for three and four year olds.
That field over there is
for zero to two year olds.
So, Calvin and I are
going to tackle that field
and Ellie and Jackson are
going to tackle this one.
- I bet they would let them go together.
-  I think so.
- Do you want them to go together?
- Well, I don't know.
We can do it either way.
- We'll stick with age groups.
There's more over there.
Calvin'll like it.
You can go with Cal, I'll stay with Jacks.
-  Alright, Jackson.
Now, tell me what you gotta do?
Okay, what do you need to do?
When you see an egg, what do you do boys?
- Go fast.
-  You run fast to
it and then what do you do?
- Put them
-  Put it in your bucket.
Right, Calvin?
You see an egg and you put
it in your bucket, okay.
- Yeah.
-  Now only eggs on the ground.
We don't take eggs from
other people, okay?
- Okay.
-  Good boys.
These kids are doing so good at waiting.
They're literally, look
at him inch-worming.
Look at him inch-worming.
There are so many eggs
out there just waiting
and they see them.
Like, they know they're right there
and they're just good to wait.
Seven, six, five, ready,
get ready, here we go.
Go, run, run, run, run, run!
Go Calvin, go get the eggs!
-  He stepped over
it, he stepped over it.
(Jared laughs)
-  Get back up, son, get back up.
He missed the ones right in front of him.
Oh, I guess we're supposed
to run out with them.
Oh my gosh.
Go, Jackson, go.
(Jared laughs)
Did you find an egg, buddy?
Oh, you're already eating it.
Wow, you don't waste any time, do you?
Are you excited to show Jackson?
I bet Jackson's excited to show you.
-  I got four.
-  You got four eggs?
You got one, should we count them?
Two, three, four, five, six eggs!
This must be special.
It's tied shut.
-  Six eggs?
-  This one must be special.
It's tied shut.
-  Ooo.
-  Alright, so before we go play,
there's one special egg that's taped
and I think we're gonna
have Jackson open it
before we go play.
Oh, maybe not.
Maybe it just has lots of candy in it.
-  Whoah!
-  Does it just have lots of candy?
Wow, that's cool.
Should we go play at the park now?
- Yeah, let's go to the slide park.
-  Let's go to the slide park.
Is there anything in it?
Open it up.
- Yeah!
-  That's a good little treat.
- Oh my gosh.
-  What is it?
- Candy!
-  Yeah!
(mellow guitar music)
- We put the kids down for quiet time
and Ellie is making something good.
What are you making?
- Well, so church is late tomorrow for us.
Like, we get home really
late so I'm making
as much as I can today so we
can just come home and eat.
- Right.
It's a good time to do things
while kids are having quiet time.
Ellie's cooking and I'm getting ready
for our next Easter activity.
You saw this morning, I was
hollowing out a bunch of eggs
and I have a bunch of paint
and so I'm working on that
right now and I've also got
some colored tissue paper.
So, we're gonna fill the eggs with paint
and then you'll see what happens next.
It's gonna be really cool.
I'm excited about it.
Alright, I have one box
of eggs all the way done
and I wanna show you what it looks like
'cause I think it looks pretty cool.
I think I'm pretty crafty right now.
Take a look at these.
So, the tissue paper
just covers up the paint,
so it doesn't spill as
much as it possibly could
and identifies what color
of paint is in there.
So, we've got white, green,
blue, purple, yellow, and red
and the idea is to throw the
white ones after the color ones
are on there because
we're using white canvas.
Oh, wait, I didn't even tell you.
If you guys couldn't guess
already, what we're doing is
we're taking these eggs and
we're throwing them on canvas
to make like a painting.
So, that's the surprise.
I ruined it.
Shoot.
Anyway, it's still fun.
Jackson, come tell me what
colors you see in these paints.
- Green,
blue,
purple,
white,
yellow,
red.
-  Cool.
We're gonna do something
really fun with these, okay,
but I want you guys to go
back downstairs for quiet time
so it's more of a surprise, okay.
Can you do that?
Look at you sneaking that chair over,
trying to get up here too.
Okay, so, let's go back downstairs
so we can have this be a surprise.
- I washed my hands, just so you know.
-  Oh, I know you did.
I didn't.
-  This is one
of the things I made.
It's broccoli corn casserole.
We won't eat all of this stuff now
but we have to save it for tomorrow
but we also don't wanna
waste a food that we have
in our fridge 'cause we're
leaving for our trip on Monday
so this is what I was able
to pull out of our fridge
to come up with as an afternoon snack
to get us by until dinner.
Celery, peanut butter, strawberries,
zucchini with some salt and
pepper on it that I grilled
and the kids just got done eating
and they had a bunch of
yogurt but I'm cleaning up.
Of course, Calvin, he won't eat fruit.
He ate everything else but not the fruit.
So, there is that.
I just put the kids in
their own rooms now.
Jackson will not fall asleep
but I gave him two toys
and said, "Okay, stay here
for like ten more minutes
"while I clean up."
So, I have all these toys.
Calvin's down for a nap.
Did I just say toys?
You know what I meant.
I'm going to clean up and then
I will finish taking care of
and playing with the kids.
My eyes.
I need to open them up and wake up.
- Oh, shucks, well Grandma
and Grandpa have come over
and they have something for the boys.
- What do we have here?
-  Whoah.
- This is for, what is your name?
- Jackson.
- Jackson.
This is for Daddy.
This is for Ellie.
- Thank you.
We love these.
- And who is this for?
- Calvin.
- Calvin.
Looks, this goes with it.
-  It's a hello car.
Look, it's a hello car.
-  Penny, do you
want a little bite of it.
- It's a Laffy Taffy car.
- Oh my goodness.
Your favorite candy and your favorite toy.
What's up doc?
Thanks guys.
That's sweet of you.
These are really clever, huh.
They look like carrots.
- So, Jared is getting set up
and I thought that this year,
it would be fun, rather
than dying Easter eggs,
to I saw on Pinterest,
for toddlers that you fill
the eggs up with paint and you throw them
and it makes something kind of cute.
So, I thought that would
be a little more fun than,
you know, messing with dying the eggs.
- Get the hands.
- I mean, I remember doing
that last year and it was like
they were really still kind of little.
So, I think they'll have
more fun throwing it.
- So, we each can throw nine eggs.
Now, hold on.
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.
These are eggs, so they're breakable.
Now, the tissue paper
is what color this is.
So, we have red, blue, purple,
green, yellow, and white.
Jackson, you're gonna go
first and you're gonna take
pick one at a time.
- I want blue.
- Okay, so pick up a blue one.
And now throw it at the canvas.
(cheering)
(upbeat music)
-  That's awesome.
(upbeat music)
-  Was that fun?
- Yeah.
I wanna try another one.
-  You wanna try another one?
You know what, I think you can
have one of my eggs and throw
so you each get nine.
I'll give you one of mine.
Do you wanna do one more?
- Yeah.
-  That is so cute, actually.
-  Right there.
Throw it.
(cheering)
-  I think those are cute.
-  Oh, he's finger painting.
-  That's cute.
-  Good job.
Look at him go.
I'm much more civilized
than the throw painting.
I'm a finger painter.
Professional, by trade.
(upbeat music)
Our turn?
I gave it all I had, too.
-  Awesome.
This is a kids washable
paint so we'll all jump
in the bathtub when we're
done, or the hot tub.
I'm gonna try and do
mine a little different.
Well, that's not how
I thought it would be.
I'll just throw it, then.
I was gonna try and do white in the middle
and the colored around.
-  Oh, that's a good idea.
For the windup, go for it.
(laughs)
Yeah, that purple looks great.
(laughs)
Mom!
You got it right in the face!
Ellie!
We've got a man down.
We got a man down.
Calvin looks like Two-Face.
Calvin, look at me.
Calvin.
You guys.
What are you doing?
Oh, you boys.
- I like everyone else's.
You guys all did an A plus.
-  See if you can find a blue one.
- Or the green.
That would be cool.
There's like no green on there.
-  There you go.
That's a little variety.
-  Tradition.
You silly.
You silly.
-  Did I tell
you this is permanent?
So, here is the aftermath of all the eggs.
I think more paint got on the
ground than on the paintings.
- Jackson and Calvin.
-  Jackson right
there, Calvin right there.
- Momma.
-  They did way
better than we did, Ellie.
- I know!
I'm disappointed.
And Jared.
-  And then mine.
Those are so fun, don't you think?
-  We're totally
doing this every year.
-  That's awesome.
What a fun new tradition.
- Love it!
-  It's a messy
one but it's a fun one.
- I think it's cute.
I was disappointed in mine
but now I kinda like it.
- It is pretty cool, huh.
If you guys are interested,
we will be selling these
on our website.
We'll link 'em down below.
Probably starting at 99, 99, 99.
- But if you buy in the next 30 minutes,
we will include two
more for the same price.
- So, they can be yours for the price,
or we could do auction.
We'll do auction starting at 99, 99, 99.
Did you boys have so
much fun throwing eggs?
Was that like crazy cool?
Well, the hot tub is calling
our name and guess what boys?
We have a friend waiting
for us in the hot tub.
We've got a friend.
You're about to see.
Let's go sit in the hot tub.
- I totally forgot about the (inaudible)
-  Yeah, you guys ready?
Penny, you guys are gonna come with it.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
This is our new friend and
Jackson's about to get on him.
What do you think?
-  Okay, hold on tight.
That's amazing, it holds you up.
(upbeat music)
- Ugh, oh geez.
Did you guys enjoy that ride?
Can you even see?
Penny got a hold of you,
took you on a little ride up in the dirt.
Back to the hot tub!
Okay, catch Ellie.
- Hey, guys, we are ready for bed
and I have something sad to tell you.
I'm no longer in a blue robe.
That's kind of sad, honestly.
I was really.
-  How many vlogs have we been in
with your blue robe?
- I've been in a lot of
vlogs with that blue robe.
Jared got it for me for
Christmas several years ago
and I loved it and it was so soft
but it had gone through
a lot of things, so.
-  It's seen it's better days.
- It's seen it's better days,
so now welcome the pink Ellie robe.
Pink is my favorite color, so.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
We had a wonderful day with the kids.
We always do but today was extra fun.
Just lots of activities.
- Fun laughs and smiles.
- The painting, we need to do a lot more.
The kids loved that.
Tomorrow I'm really
excited to go to church.
It's Easter Sunday.
We're gonna have a really fun
Easter egg hunt at your mom's
in the morning, we'll have
breakfast and do that.
- It's gonna be a great,
and then it's the beginning
of a great new week
and we're very excited.
- Birthday week!
- Thank you guys for watching.
