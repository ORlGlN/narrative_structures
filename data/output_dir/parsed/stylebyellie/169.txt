(tender guitar music)
-  This is where we go poo poo.
- Yeah.
-  You're gonna make
sure you go poop here, huh?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Okay, you keep trying.
Yeah, you're doing so good.
(laughs)
-  Yeah.
- I'm so proud of you.
(laughing)
Just like I did with Jackson,
I tried to get him warmed
up to sitting on a toilet,
before we went full force potty training.
And Calvin has been doing really good
around the toilet,
where he will be willing to sit
for just a second, and then he'll hurry
and get off.
And I'm really happy with how he has been
at least willing to be around the toilet.
It took Jackson quite a
while to warm up to that,
but because Calvin sees
Jackson all the time
going potty, he's willing
to sit on the potty.
I definitely feel like
I'm warming him up to it,
and then here, really soon, he'll be ready
to be potty trained.
I don't feel like he's quite ready
to go full force,
personally, but we'll see.
(gentle guitar music)
We could bring your teepee out.
Should we bring your teepee out too?
- This should be our home.
- Okay.
The weather outside is chilly
and so the best thing to do inside
other than watch TV all
day, is build some forts.
And then build some forts,
so you can continue watching TV all day.
Right, am I right?
- Teepee home.
-  That's your teepee home.
We've got a bar stool area.
It's your teepee home.
Okay, let's get our
rocks out and our pillows
and we can lay here, pop some popcorn.
Sound good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
- Movie.
- Uh, Halloween movie?
- Let's watch a Christmas one.
- What?
You can't skip Halloween and Thanksgiving.
- I need to do a Christmas.
- Find, Polar Express it is.
Do you want to show them
all the ones you learned?
- Yes, this one and this one.
- Okay, sit down and tell us.
Jackson and I went over letters today,
and he is on level two with pre-school.
So this is still a rough draft,
we just learned them today.
Show 'em what you learned.
- I learned this one.
-  What is it?
-  What is it?
-  It's an A.
- That's right.
- Look really close.
- What sound is this?
- Da.
- And what's this?
- E.
- D-E.
- De.
- De, good job.
- De.
-  Good.
- V.
-  Good job.
(laughs)
-  He learned all these today.
- R.
-  Arrr, like a pirate.
- Arr.
-  That was a hard one.
- M.
-  So close.
-  Remember he's going, N.
-  N.
- N.
- Yeah, N.
-  Good job.
He learned those today.
- That's all level two.
-  Show Daddy the level one.
- E.
-  Good.
- S.
-  Yeah.
Oh that's a good picture.
- Yeah.
- K!
- K. (laughs)
- T.
- Good.
- Good job.
- Jackson I'm so proud of you.
Good job, buddy.
Wait, what did you do downstairs?
- We made a blanket fort downstairs.
- You made a blanket fort downstairs?
Well why are you keeping this a secret.
Show me!
Let's go look at it.
I gotta see this.
I can't believe you're making
blanket forts without me.
-  That's what you
get for going to church.
(laughing)
- Hey, at least I've been
spiritually uplifted.
Oh, close my eyes, sorry.
Yeah!
Let's try again.
Come on Jackson.
(chill music)
Woo!
Yeah!
Woo, that was a good trick.
Okay, Mom your turn.
Whoa.
Oh, I can tell this is gonna be a big one.
This is gonna be a big one.
Whoa, he jumped over it.
Did he just pick a flower for you?
- Yes, thank you.
- Awww, that's cute.
- And just like that, it was winter.
Look at these hats
- Seriously,
- I mean,
- the boys are wearing.
- We live in the mountains.
- I'll bring a flower for you.
- Okay.
- Aww, that's sweet.
- We live in the mountains,
so it's colder than down
in other places, I guess.
- In the valley.
- But I just didn't
expect it to be so quick.
It's very quick.
- Oh no, it's cold.
- My hands, I'm like, I need to get gloves
or something like that.
- Oh thank you.
- Thank you.
- Man, we get all four
seasons, and they just
- They come really fast.
- Come really fast and go really fast.
The ones you want don't
stick around very long
and the ones you don't want, they're like,
hey neighbor, I'm here to
see ya, how's it going.
A couple days ago, we
took our family pictures,
and I'm gonna put a picture
that I posted on Instagram
right now, make sure you're following me
on Instagram, because we'll be posting
more of those soon,
but the colors on the
leaves were just absolutely
breathtaking, and we live
close to those leaves,
so I figured we'd drive by
and fly the drone out,
because it is just fiery red,
beautiful yellow and they're som green,
so there's some really great contrast.
And fall leaves are
probably the best part.
- That's Mommy.
- Hi.
- Wait, what were you guys saying?
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo, poo poo.
-  Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Calvin, can you say it?
-  Da da doo.
- - Cock-a-doodle-doo.
- Da da doo da.
(Jared laughing)
- Waa, Penny, oh no!
Alright sweetheart, are you
ready to go on this ride?
Wait wait, you're not Ellie.
What the?
Hey, huh, what?
(Ellie laughs)
(majestic piano music)
(majestic piano music)
- So you know what I was thinking
while we were on our walk?
- My shoes.
- Yeah?
- Your shoes, let's fix it.
So what I was thinking on our walk,
is we have very long
winters where we live.
Our first winter here, it wasn't too bad.
Last winter was crazy.
- Crazy.
- And this winter is
supposed to be bad too.
I feel like, especially
during the winter months,
we're gonna be doing a lot of challenges
in the month, don't you think?
- Oh yeah.
- Because we're gonna be inside a lot,
so it would be fun to break it up
for us and for the vlog wise.
-  Totally.
- I think that would be fun.
- I think that would be so much mun.
- We haven't done very many.
- No, so what challenges should we do?
- Totally, I want to do some.
- I do too.
- Do you want to do some?
- Yeah.
- Jackson, do you want to do some?
-  Yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Ready, family challenge
(howling)
- But when it's all said and done,
winter is coming and I
am not ready for this.
Like I'm not ready.
(Ellie laughs)
-  We've been so spoiled.
- My fingers are like, I can't even grip.
- Look my nose is cold, it's purple.
But look at the view.
-  That's beautiful.
-  I love where we live.
-  I do, I love it,
-  It's beautiful.
-  It's just cold.
-  The kids are like, I'm done.
- I just went over all the footage
from the drone, and I noticed that there's
a lot more brown than I thought.
Like literally the
leaves change like that,
it is crazy how fast we've
already, not missed it,
but it's already changing into drab brown.
It's not as red as I wanted it to be,
but that also reminded me
of it being super cold.
It reminded me of living in Finland.
And I, whoa, Penny, not again.
Ahh, hey sister.
Okay.
Alright.
I was reminded of when I lived in Finland,
it gets really cold in the
winter time in Finland,
I think I saw negative
40 was the coldest I saw,
that's the same, Celsius and Fahrenheit.
But these Finns, they were
talking to me about wintertime,
and they were like, you Americans,
you don't like the cold.
And I was like, yeah, there's some people
who like the cold,
there's some people
that like snowboarding.
It's nice to have hot
chocolate and sit by the fire
and all of that stuff,
and they're like that's exactly my point.
You guys like to be warm.
You like to sit by the fire,
you don't like to be in the cold.
You don't like hot chocolate
because it's cold outside,
you like hot chocolate
because it makes you warm.
- Totally.
- And I was like oh my
gosh, you have a point.
And then it's funny, because
those same people were like,
we like to have Popsicles
outside when it's cold.
Doesn't that sound kind of like terrible?
But I'm not sure if that's the case
for all Finns, but that is
something that they said,
they're like oh yeah,
we love ice cream,
- That's crazy.
- we love the cold, and then I thought,
- I don't do well.
- oh my gosh,
- We're the Batman in this situation
and they're Bane.
We merely adapted to the cold,
they were born in it, molded by it.
Okay sleepy Jared is so sleepy,
so sleepy Jared is gonna go to sleep.
Thank you for watching the video today.
Have a wonderful start
to your brand new week
and we'll see you next time.
Bye.
