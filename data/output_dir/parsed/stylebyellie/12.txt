- I think I've got myself
in a little bit of a sticky
situation.
- Two hours left!
- Woo! That was scary.
-  Good morning stinky face.
Good morning stinky face.
- We're going
-  Going home
- I'm lame
- We're going home
- K I just literally wiped
this floor so you guys move
this way.
-  Oh. Okay let's uh, let's uh,
make our way over to the exit over here.
We are going to say goodbye
to our little camper as
we drive home and say going
We're saying goodbye to our oasis Ellie.
- I know. I am glad that we
stayed a few days it was really
fun
-  It was really fun
- We'll come back.
I want to do, on the way
home I'm actually gonna write
down a bunch of state parks
that we should go to with
the kids, and Penny can come too.
Cause I would love to do more of them.
It was really fun.
And you can stay at the state parks, like,
I was like oh we should have stayed
- Camped there.
- That would have been cool.
- That would have been really cool
- Next time.
- Yeah we talked about that
a lot yesterday as we were at
the state parks like let's just go here.
But for now I've gotta drain the pooper.
I think I've got myself in
a little bit of a sticky
situation.
You know how just mere seconds
ago I said that it's time
to empty the pooper?
Well the pooper's not emptying,
I think we have a clog.
- It's super windy and so we
jumped in the car and we're
waiting for someone to finish up.
Uhhh we're learning every
time we go on a little trip.
But I love that we have done
little trips because we're
learning every time.
- I don't know how it
happened but I think our,
our tanked is clogged.
(Ellie giggling)
-  Jackson, did you
poop in the toilet too much?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah? And daddy.
Any way we really don't know
what it is, but Daisy Fresh
is here to help us unclog
our trailer.
- Yeah..(baby rambles)
- Those are your blue glasses.
- Oh jeez
(Ellie giggling)
-  We're newbies!
- K so.
- We're newbies!
- I don't often make mistakes
(Ellie laughs)
Wait no! Here's the thing!
No! I take that back, I ruin everything.
I ruin everything!
- No you don't
- So what happened was, there's
two caps on the ends of the
hose.
I took the one off and I
didn't take the other off,
and
- It clogged it.
- It clogged the whole thing.
But luckily the clog was just
in the hose and not in
the tank themselves.
So strike one for Jared being stupid.
- The guy laughed.
- The guy laughed. He was like oh, I see,
I see so much worse so
don't you even worry.
Like thank goodness, I said,
you're not gonna go home
and tell your wife are ya?
He's like yeah I probably will.
- At least the camper's not full of poop.
- Yeah. Ohh..
(Ellie giggling)
- K you ready to go home?
- Let's go. Fun trip.
(upbeat guitar strumming)
-  Finally on the road.
- Oh my god.
- Good job Jar.
- That was a poopy situation.
(ding)
But we're finally on the
road. My goodness gracious.
And that's the thing is like,
I'm like, I'm upset with
myself but at the same time
I have to take it with
a grain of salt because
this is our like fourth
time ever taking it out.
- Yeah.
- You're gonna have some
things, and I went to go look at
the other hoses that they
had to get replacement caps.
None of them even had caps
on them so I was like,
oh maybe I just didn't even
need those in the first place.
Any way
- We have a lot to learn
but this is gonna be a fun
adventure like Jared and I were saying.
Our kids are gonna remember
these hopefully trips for their
whole life cause like, this
is like a lot of the things
that we wanna do like as a family.
- Yeah and hopefully they
remember the good parts about that
- They will.
(slow trap music)
-  You have the
garage door opener ready?
K hold it, we have about 7 more hours
- That was such a sad face
-  Aww.
Mawww.
- Oh seven hours. That's
like 14 Peppa Pig shows.
(slow trap music)
-  Is this crazy?
You don't love it?
Oh my gosh. I don't even
know, oh I saw lighting.
(Ellie gasping)
It is down pouring.
I just saw lighting and then
it thundered like crazy.
I don't even know if Penny
gotta go to the bathroom.
They were outside for awhile
but she, she just was like
standing there.
Did she go potty?
- I don't know, I there,
uh..I fricken hurt my legs.
I got pelted every
where. I am sobbing wet.
- It's hailing.
(Ellie chuckling)
- That was scary.
- Did she go potty?
- I have no idea. It hurt too
bad maybe we'll wait it out
- She was just standing there.
Let's go, we'll stop again in an hour.
Gosh dang it.
- Do you hear that thunder?
- Yeah I saw the lighting.
- It was right there.
- Yeah I saw the lighting.
(slow trap music)
-  This is kind of scary.
- Yeah. You don't like it?
-  What do you want me to do?
- Film the blue sky
- Okay I'll make sure to
film the blue sky guys,
we see it, it's over there.
I filmed it.
(Ellie giggling)
(slow trap music)
- We have two hours left
-  Woo hoo
- Right two hours?
- Two and a half
- 6:30. We have two hours left
- We are almost there. Final stretch.
- Bahhh!!
- Kind of has felt like the
final stretch for the past
two hours, hasn't it?
- Uh. I am so unbelievably
grateful that we grabbed Calvin's
potty. It's been such a
life saver when we stopped.
- Yes it has.
- He hasn't had any accidents
on the way home and we've
been driving forever so,
very grateful we brought that potty.
What's up? Did you just huff?
- No I'm just tryna get up this hill.
I'm just like, trying to help the car.
Come on!
All these little cars are
passing us like nobody's business
I'm like, come on we
can get there, come on.
-  Oh Penny girl,
we are almost home.
Trying to make everybody
happy on this, um, drive home
is sometimes really hard
and sometimes we just say
sorry we can't do anything
for you, be quiet.
They've been pretty good though.
Penny is very ready to get home,
she's having the time
of her life right now.
Jared's taking a lot of extra
time with her so she walk
and run around. It's snowing!
Kids are you doing okay?
- No. I wanna see dad.
- You want to see dad?
Look out your window,
other window, look out, do you see him?
- Yeah
- Are you doing okay?
What's wrong with you?
- I need to go pee.
- Uh. We just came back from
peeing, he doesn't need to do
that. He just doesn't want
to be in his car seat.
Jackson we just, just
two seconds ago went.
We're almost home k?
- No. I want to go pee again.
- Again?
- Yeah.
-  Where are they
running to? Just around.
Okay guys, I'm gonna take Jackson
one more time, even though
you just went.
- Too dark! Too dark!
-  Then don't cover
your eyes if it's too dark.
Pull your strap up. See
your strap on your chest?
Pull it up. Pull it up. Little more.
Good job.
Pull yours up.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Home sweet home! We made it.
I feel like I'm going to pass out.
Calvin! Are you running
because you have so much space?
First thing he did when he
got inside was cat speed and
he ran through the whole living room.
Oh my gosh. It feels good to be home.
Okay boys, I just want to say
that I am so incredibly proud
of how well you guys did today in the car.
You were good sports all day long.
We were in the car for
almost 10 hours today.
We took lots of potty breaks.
We had good snacks.
- And there was a rain storm.
- There was a rain storm.
There was tons of traffic.
There was tons of snow.
There was tons of rain.
It kind of was like the worst drive ever.
Yeah lots of thunder.
- And two uh piles of thunder.
- Two piles of thunder

You guys were troopers the whole time.
So thank you for being so
wonderful and awesome during our

Ending the night on a laugh.
I went out to the garage to
back up the trailer inside the
house, or garage, I guess,
you don't want to back it up
in the house. And everyone was asleep.
Oh. You're here, you're laughing.
You're laughing you're not asleep.
I thought you were asleep for a second.
Hey.

energy to watch The Flash?
- Ugh! Yes.
- Okay, yes! We're gonna watch The Flash.
-  I yell at Jared when
he falls asleep during shows
- Yes you do.
- Yeah. I, I like think I've
fallen asleep maybe twice.
- Yeah. And the thing is, I
love falling asleep watching
shows. Like it's my favorite thing.
- It reminds me of
growing up with my sister,
like watching shows with Julie,
I always wanted to but then
she'd leave in the middle of it
or she'd fall asleep, and I was like,
watch this show with me.
- I just want you to watch
the whole thing with me.
That's your thing.
- I just want you to love me.
- Hey, wasn't driving home crazy today?
- Um. Yeah. There was a really
bad wreck that happened like
seconds in front of us.
- Yeah.
- Um. That was very
crazy and nerve wracking.
And the weather. And..

Literally was not a great day today.
Like as bad as that sounds.
We had a poopy situation.
We had terrible weather. Like hail,
snow,
rain,
thunder, and lighting. All today.
