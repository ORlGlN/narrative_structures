(light music)
-  Good morning.
- Good morning.
-  Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Having the kids sleep
in their sleeping bags
in our room on the floor, I had no idea
if it would even go well,
but usually every night,
one of them wakes up
and ends up in our room
and in our bed.
This is the first time in months
that Calvin has not woken up one time
and has stayed in his own bed.
Why?
Why?
I mean, months, guys.
Months.
Is it because he was in
our room the whole time
and he liked the temperature?
I don't know.
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.
- Are you excited?
We'll just slowly talk
a little louder, okay?
- Come, we're gonna see.
Santa came!
- Okay?
Let's let him wake up.
- Merry Christmas.
Should we go see if Santa Clause came?
- Let's go see!
What?
What?
It's Santa!
He came!
-  It looks awesome!
- What the?
My favorite thing!
-  What is it?
- A marble runner.
-  A marble runner?
- Yeah!
- Should we open the bag
and try them on real quick?
- Yeah!
- Oh that's huge, it's as tall as you!
- It is as tall as you!
-  Okay, drop it in there.
-  Jackson!
-  Round and
round and round it goes.
Will it stop, we'll never know!
-  Oh my gosh.
Do you want to go put a couple in?
-  That was so cool!
Merry Christmas, Mom!
- Merry Christmas!
-  Do you love it?
- The kids slept in their own bed!
-  Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
(laughing)
(marbles falling)
-  That's so cool.
(squealing)
- It's yours!
-  Go sit on the fireplace,
and you can open them together.
- How did he get all
of these presents here?
-  I don't know.
He's pretty magical.
- Ho, ho.
-  Ho ho?
-  Did ho ho
come and give you a box?
- Yeah!
-  He's just so
mesmerized by everything
he doesn't even want to open one.
(laughing)
Oh, what is it?
(paper rustling)
- It's a Jack in the Box!
That was what I wanted!
-  Is it a Jack in the Box?
-  It is heavy.
It looks like it says marbles.
-  Are there
marbles on the pictures?
Maybe there's tons of marbles in there.
- I put some in that.
-  That's a great idea.
- What?
What is it?
(laughing)
You want me to open the box?
- No.
(gasping)
Boat.
-  It's a boat!
(squealing)
- Did you get a boat?
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- Do you want me to open it?
(paper rustling)
- Maybe it's a Jack in the Box.
-  Maybe it's a Jack in the Box.
- It is a Jack in the Box!
-  Whoa!
-  That's what you wanted!
(music chiming)
(gasping)
- A clown.
(laughing)
(music chiming)
(laughing)
- Every time!
Want to open that one?
- Yeah.
- Okay, sit down.
- A baby!
- What should we name this baby?
- Ty-Ty.
- Ty-Ty?
- Yeah, Ty-Ty.
(laughing)
- Ty-Ty.
Let's get your baby out.
It's gonna help you get ready for brother.
- I'm gonna open this one.
- Is that your baby?
Look, this is gonna help you
get ready for baby brother.
- Yeah!
- Are you so excited?
- So, this is gonna help you
learn how to help the baby,
keep the baby safe, feed the
baby, change the baby's diaper!
This is all gonna be so helpful
when Mommy has our new baby.
- I want to open this one.
I'm gonna open this one.
- It's his bed.
- I'm gonna open this one.
- Okay.
- Okay.
(laughing)
- Let's let Daddy open a present, okay?
- Okay, I'm excited.
- Okay, let me get Daddy his present.
Does Daddy have a box?
I think I know what
one I want him to open.
(paper rustling)
- Use your knife, Dad!
- Okay.
(laughing)
Look at this!
- I know you want a hat.
- Yeah, I do!
This is perfect.
This is one of the one
things that I actually
wanted.
- Needed.
- And, this is... No!
No way!
Oh my gosh, boys, look at this.
These are all new Carhartt coats.
- You can wear yours,
but the boys can all
wear theirs' next year.
This is a six month one.
- Oh my goodness.
- Isn't that so cute?
You guys will all be matching.
(Jackson yelling)
- Rocks?
- Yeah!
- That's awesome!
(Jackson yelling)
- Do you like rocks?
- Yeah, I love these rocks.
- Wait, wait.
This says it's a rock tumbler refill pack,
so I think there must be
something that goes with it.
Give Mommy the small one,
she can start with that one.
- I like small things.
Is it a pocket knife?
- No.
- That's the size.
- Yeah.
- What?
Are those the lipsticks?
(laughing)
You are the best.
- They're not just any old lipstick.
Those are NARS Power Matte, girl!
- Oh my gosh, you are so cute.
- And, they're red just like you wanted.
- Both?
- They're two different reds.
- Jared, those are so cute!
- Oh my gosh.
- What is that?
- What is this?
- That is called a Lite-Brite.
- We've got a Lite-Brite, a
Fischer Price tape recorder.
What year is it?
(laughing)
- What the heck?
- What the heck?
- It is a rock machine!
-  Good, let's open it up!
- Rock machine, rock machine,
rock, rock, rock machine.
Let's open this up!
-  Wow.
See, they're all rough
before and they get shiny
after a long time!
- I want to open it up.
-  Open your present.
- I'm not gonna act shocked
because I think I know what it is.
- It's an instant pot!
-  Oh, your
reaction was so genuine.
- I love it.
Thank you, Jared.
-  You're so welcome.
- I can't wait to make my boiled
eggs in one minute's time.
-  This is the trendiest thing
I've ever bought for anyone ever.
- I love it.
(Jackson screaming)
It's a ship?
- What?
- Like real life.
We went on last year.
- Like where we went last year?
-  Oh my goodness, gracious.
- This is so cool.
-  That is so cool.
- Porridge, yogurt?
-  Yeah, do you
want to make some yogurt?
Done.
Instant Pot.
- This I'm very excited for.
-  Look at all the
things you can make with it.
- Thank you.
-  You're so welcome.
I'm really excited about that.
- I am too.
-  I'm gonna throw
some things in there,
cook 'em up real quick.
Here you go, buddy.
- Look at this!
-  Do you want
me to help you open it?
Oh, thanks.
Oh, what'd you?
Oh, my goodness.
It's Jack Skellington.
This is Halloween.
(jazzy music)
-  Wow.
That looks like the tray I want.
Oranges.
-  Candy cane!
-  Should we get
some hot cocoa going?
- I'm gonna use this one.
-  Okay.
- This is Halloween, this is Halloween.
(jazzy music)
- Okay, there you go.
Jacks, will you open that end?
Like this, open this end.
- We can race cars on this carpet!
- What?
-  Oh my goodness gracious.
Look at that!
-  Should we open it up?
-  Let's see if
we can wheel it out.
Look guys.
There's a church and a
hospital and a fire department
and a police station and
a park and an airport
and a carwash facility and a post office.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, and another church.
Oh, that must be a school.
Let's get our roadster racers,
and we'll race around this city.
Make sure to stay on the road.
We've got to practice safe driving.
(humming)
- We could go get all of our
Hot Wheels from downstairs.
-  Yeah, we could.
That would be a crazy traffic jam.
(laughing)
Crash, oh no!
That one is from Missy, and
after watching Cullen's vlog
I believe that this one is from Bryan
with the duct tape, so I may need to
get some power tools, Ellie.
I saw how Cullen did it.
- It's a little intense?
- Yeah.
- Oh, is it a robe?
Oh my gosh.
That was so sweet of her.
- Look at that!
- That's such a fun robe.
-  All right, we've got two left
before this crazy one, Bryan!
So, I think Ellie you
should open up this one.
This one is probably 150 pounds,
so I need you to come sit over here,
and then I'll put it right here for you.
- I love me some robe.
That is beautiful.
Look how cozy that is.
- That looks great.
- Thanks, Missy!
- Oh, look at that!
This is all for my grilling.
- Camping.
- Camping with the Dutch oven.
Awesome.
- I want a Dutch coven.
- We didn't ask for anything, you know.
(gasping)
I forgot I did ask for something.
I forgot that I asked for it.
-  What is it?
- Yay!
Who would have ever thought
I'd be so happy for a printer?
(laughing)
-  Watch out, Calvin!
- Yay!
-  So, this isn't
just a regular printer.
- I know, it's heavy.
- This is a photo printer,
and it will print pictures
up to 11 by 13, so any frame that we have
it'll do a special photo
print for that picture.
- I just told Jared my one
thing that I want to do
that's made me a little sad is
we have one billion pictures,
but they're not organized,
they're everywhere,
and they're not printed.
I like making them into books,
but I also want to print them too.
-  So, now you can print them!
Seriously this is way bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.
- It's so heavy.
-  Yeah.
- Where are we gonna put it?
This is fun because last
year we didn't do any gifts.
- I know, yeah.
- Last year we had just
moved into the house.
Okay, how did I do this?
Yeah, it's heavy too.
I don't know how I lifted it.
- Dad, can I play with it with you?
- Sure.
Oh, wow!
It's a Camp Chef.
Holy cow.
-  I figured that was a family...
- Yeah!
-  When we take the camper out.
- We can go and take it on the trailer.
Oh wow, this si great.
Ellie, thank you so much.
-  You're very welcome.
- Look, it's for camping
and for the home and patio
and for hunting and
fishing and for tailgating
which we've never done.
-  And, for cabin and RV-ing, yep.
- For scouting.
-  Yep, you haven't
called the scouts yet.
- And, even emergency preparedness.
-  Yes, all in one.
- And, I got a glove!
-  Well, it's funny.
I picked that out, and
the kids came up to me
with the glove.
They're like, "This is for Dad."
I'm like, "Yeah, I actually need that.
"Thank you."
- Ellie, thank you.
-  You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.
-  We got to make
some fun Dutch oven meals
while it's cold.
- Yeah.
Uh-oh, you're gonna call me
into the scouting program.
-  I know.
(laughing)
Don't tell any of the neighbors.
- Delete the footage!
-  You guys have
had your baby blanket
since you were babies.
Did you get another blanket?
- Yeah, it's baby.
-  Me too, I love my blanket.
-  Oh, I love that.
- Yeah, it's baby.
- I love this blanket so much.
-  Is that for your baby?
- Where's my baby?
-  Your baby is right here.
He thinks it's for the baby.
-  Why did we sleep?
That baby?
It's Calvin's.
It's a car car seat.
-  Yeah.
Calvin thinks that
blanket is for the baby.
-  Oh, he's gonna
keep the baby nice and warm.
(laughing)
-  On his face.
-  We are turning this
room into a big baby crib.
- This is the fun zone.
-  No one leaves this place
until every toy has been used and abused.
- All right, I think it's about
time we unbox this bad boy.
I have a little advice from Cullen
because he opened it, and he
used every tool under the sun,
so it's time to grab my
tools, so I can open this box
that is a mystery.
(motor whirring)
(grunting)
Domo arigato.
So, this is taking quite a
bit longer than I thought.
Drastic times calls for drastic measures.
I'll be right back.
So, I called my brother Joel,
and I called my brother Matt,
and they coached me through
getting through the first layer.
Upon opening the first
layer I noticed there's
(knocking)
a giant wooden box here,
so not quite done yet.
Just wanted you to know I choose you first
for gym class dodge ball.
Proud to know you, dude.
Bryan.
Aw, you are great.
Thanks, Bryan.
I think you're great too.
I'm guessing this is what I
use to open up the next part.
Hold on, I've got to
make a few phone calls.
Just put it in and pry it back?
Oh.
Yeah, that was so much easier
than calling the fire department, thanks.
Okay, talk to you later.
Bye.
I got it, and I didn't need any help.
(cheering)
Look at this!
The Resistance.
It's like a game box.
Boss Monster.
Codenames.
Real Butter and Sea Salt?
I've never played that
game, but I think I like it.
Thanks, Bryan.
That's awesome.
Okay.
Excuse me, is there a Calvin in the house?
-  What?
- Calvin, you want to try this?
- Yeah!
-  Okay.
-  Where's the music?
-  Push the button.
(laughing)
-  I want to play with it.
I want to play with it.
-  You can play with
it as soon as you're done
with your Lite-Brite.
-  Calvin, push
the button for music.
(music chiming)
(microphone feedback)
(laughing)
(babbling)
- All done.
Oh, fun.
Well, my love, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, I'm
trying to figure out
how to boil eggs in this.
(laughing)
First thing, boil eggs.
I like my hat a lot.
It keeps my ears nice and warm.
- Oh my gosh, this morning
couldn't have been...
- More perfect?
- I just can't even believe
our kids slept all night.
- I know, that's the best
Christmas present of all.
(laughing)
- I seriously woke up and was like,
"Calvin's not next to me.
"What?"
- I am going to put my Carhartt vest on,
keep my Carhartt hat on,
and I'm gonna go plow the driveway
because we had
- Sounds amazing.
So much snow.
- a white Christmas.
- Yahoo, I did it!
Thank you, Jared.
I used the Instant Pot for the first time,
and I made myself some boiled eggs
like I do every morning.
It was really easy to use.
I'm so glad I have it, and I
always eat avocados with it.
So, avocados and eggs are what
I usually eat for breakfast.
-  What is it?
-  I made eggs!
Do you want some?
- No.
(laughing)
- I figured that's what you would say.
I'm so excited to learn how
to cook more stuff in that
especially soup, so fun.
I'm glad that the kids are
playing with each other's stuff,
and they're okay about it, you know?
Calvin's playing with the marble run.
He's playing with music,
and I'm eating my eggs.
- All right, I'm nearly all suited up.
I've got my Carhartt hat
on, I've got my vest on.
Ellie, I just need one other thing,
and it's provided in the
bag that you gave me.
Thank you so much.
- Gloves?
-  The SmartWool socks.
- Oh yeah, I was like, "What?"
-  My feets got to stay warm.
- I literally just ate three boiled eggs,
and I'm on cloud 10, and
I'm gonna... (laughing)
- You know the reference is cloud nine,
but you're just so much more above that
that you're cloud 10?
- I am, that's how happy I am.
-  Aw, you're so sweet.
Were they good?
Did they taste different?
- Yeah, they were the
best eggs I've ever had.
-  Seriously?
- I'm not even kidding you.
-  That is so funny.
Thanks Instapot.
You made my wife happier
than I could ever.
(laughing)
- Calvin is so attached to his blanket.
-  This is your blanket right here.
Look, look how big it is.
- No, it's baby's!
-  That's your baby's blanket?
- Yeah.
-  But, look how small this is.
- Yeah, it's mine.
-  And, now this
is yours, a big blanket!
(whining)
You don't want it?
- No.
- Okay.
I think it's gonna take a while for Calvin
to warm up to a new blanket.
Calvin!
I think someone's tired.
(laughing)
- Hey, wait!
-  So, which ones
should we put in first?
-  This one.
-  I'm looking up the instructions.
-  Okay, we're
figuring out how to do this.
You put 'em in the tumbler.
- This tumbler?
-  Yep, with a grit polish,
and they tumble for a few days.
- Is the rocks in here?
- Yes, until they're shiny.
Oh, we're blurry.
Until they're shiny.
He is loving these rocks.
He screamed when he opened them.
I can't wait for them to
see how they turn out,
and then they even have these
that you can put them in.
-  Nice.
These are gonna look so cool.
- I'm gonna do these ones next.
- Let's just start with these ones,
and let's get grit polish number one.
This will take three to five days.
-  Okay.
- This one right here?
-  Yeah.
- And, this will get rid
of all the rough edges,
and then we'll do grit number two,
and that's six to eight days,
and number three takes six to eight days,
and grit number four which is the polish
takes seven to 10 days.
-  Oh my goodness.
- So, this is gonna be
a long time, Jackson.
-  But, this one will
take three to four days.
- And, we can look 'em up.
We'll look at 'em and see
all of the stuff, okay?
-  This is cool.
Jackson remember at the
beach when you found
all those soft shiny rocks?
That's what this is doing.
It's like sand.
- So, we got water in.
- Okay.
They're getting shiny!
(laughing)
They're gonna get shiny.
- Yes, they are.
Oceans and rivers take
thousands and thousands of years
to make rocks smooth and
polished like gem stones,
and this is speeding up the process,
and in four weeks we'll have gem stones
that normally would have taken
thousands of years to do.
We'll set it for four days,
and can you reach this button right there?
Can you reach it?
(cheering)
Do you see it?
Is that so cool?
(laughing)
Do you like that Jackson?
- I want to take out the rocks.
(laughing)
- I want to take out the rocks.
Oh, this might be a long process.
Okay, it's gonna take four days,
so we're just gonna forget about it.
We're gonna let it do its thing,
and then in four days we'll come back.
- One, two, three, four.
-  That's exactly right, four days.
- My men are ready.
You ready kids?
-  Get a little on the
snow to help you slide better.
-  Okay, ready?
Hold on tight.
Hi.
He just waved to me.
Now go really slow on that pull.
You know what you're doing.
(laughing)
Look at that!
They are so cute!
Jackson is trying to fall out.
Jackson's out.
-  We'll come around for him.
-  He's wondering where Jackson is.
We'll go get him!
(laughing)
We'll go get him.
(laughing)
He is so happy.
(laughing)
(cheering)
-  Is that fun, guys?
-  Okay, you pull us now.
Jump on, jump on!
Hurry!
Whoa!
(laughing)
Lost a boot!
I'll come help you.
(engine rumbling)
Daddy's gonna help us make a sledding hill
in the backyard.
Are you guys ready, Cal?
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.
(laughing)
Shut up.
No, I just got to... just a minute.
Daddy's gonna make a path, is that right?
Okay, sorry just a minute.
Scoot over to the edge.
Perfect, right there mister.
- Here we go!
-  Good!
Do that 10 more times.
There's a four wheeler with
one, two, three kids on the back.
That's awesome.
- Yay!
(Ellie gasping)
-  Oh my gosh, that was so awesome!
- I want to do it again.
-  Okay.
Was that crazy?
Do you want to do it again?
-  Hey dude, you
got to walk up the hill.
-  Yeah, get your butt up.
You can walk now.
-  Walk up the hill.
-  No, wrong way, wrong way.
(laughing)
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way!
Okay, Go Jacks!
Stay here, Cal.
(whooping)
One, two, three.
- It didn't work!
-  And, we got Miss Penny.
You gonna go on the slide too, girl?
Hi Miss Penn!
Hi Miss Penny!
Merry Christmas!
Hi girl!
Whoa, that is so fast.
That is why Dad does it.
- And, you reinforced that bank.
-  Look at all this space up here
for you to run, girl.
The snow is so deep.
Hi, girl.
You looking for your ball?
Did you lose it?
Oh, there you go.
(cheering)
(laughing)
(ball squeaking)
(gentle jazzy music)
(grunting)
You missed it!
- I need to do it again.
-  Well, that was silly.
Try two.
(cheering)
- I can play the drums!
-  Okay, should
we go watch a movie?
(grunting)
- Bye.
And this, yeah.
-  Oh, his hand!
Is this where you guys are
gonna want to sleep again?
Okay, get in.
Snuggle up.
Where's your blanket, Jacks?
It's on the bed.
-  I'll grab it for you.
-  Are you getting
warmed up to a new blanket?
No?
- No.
-  You still like your old blanket?
What about you, Jackson, do
you like your new blanket?
- Yeah!
- It's cool, it's got airplanes,
and cool stuff on it, huh?
- We're gonna see if that
was a coincidence last night,
or if Calvin really did
just sleep flipping good
in his own little mattress.
We are gonna watch a
Christmas movie as a family.
I think The Christmas Story.
- Yes.
-  That's a fun one.
- It is a fun one, and it's also the one
that my brother Nate was afraid of
because of the whole tongue
stuck to the pole scene.
He was scared of that
movie because of that.
-  Oh, that's funny.
- I think that's why we didn't
watch it very much as kids.
- We never really watched
it when we were younger.
It was more a little bit when I got older.
- Yeah.
We always watched A Muppet
Christmas Carol, Santa Clause,
and It's a Wonderful Life.
Those are the three.
- I want to see the baby
want to stick his tongue in.
-  He's excited to
see the kid stick his tongue.
- Here's how Jackson is as a personality.
My brother is scared of that movie,
Jackson is looking forward
to that part of the movie.
He's excited about it.
-  Okay, go sit
down and we'll watch it.
- Let's go.
Well, the kids are in bed,
and this is the aftermath
of our Christmas day.
Just wonderful, happiness,
joy, food, snacks,
laughter, fun, and social media,
posting pictures of those things.
- They literally played all day.
We played Mario Kart, and
I thought that Jackson
would just hold on to the remote.
-  And, just wouldn't go?
- Oh yeah.
-  He's a three year old.
- He totally played a legitimate game.
- Yeah, he did good in races.
He didn't get last place all the time.
He knows how to play Mario Kart.
- Sometimes I got last
place, and he didn't.
(laughing)
- And, that's with Ellie trying.
I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.
We need to get you better
at Mario Kart, okay?
- I know, I know.
I want to go to Bonnie's and play there.
-  They've got
the regular Nintendo.
- Yes, that's what I want, so cool.
-  So fun, yeah.
- Seriously, today could
not have been sweeter.
The boys, Calvin, ho ho, big box?
- Box, he got what he wanted.
He got a box.
I think it's so cool that
Calvin was so excited
about that little baby boy.
He's been playing with
it and caring for it.
It's a very small example of
what Calvin is gonna be like
when we have our little baby.
- So excited.
- And, it's just fun to prepare
and to teach him a little bit about that,
so I think that's cool.
But, all in all I think
today was wonderful.
It was just really really great.
- I hope that you guys all had a good day,
and if you don't celebrate
Christmas I hope that you
were able to get a
little feeling of the joy
that we had here, and
hopefully you guys had a fun,
wonderful day with you
or with your family.
I just love this time of year.
We're gonna do the same thing tomorrow.
Jammies, food, snow.
-  Toys.
- We're gonna do the same thing tomorrow.
-  Everything.
(laughing)
I usually say this every year,
but I just wanted to say it.
From the bottom of our hearts, if you guys
don't have anyone during
the holiday season
whether it's Christmas, New
Years, let us be your family,
let us be your friends.
Confide in us, be a part of the community,
be friendly to those in
the comments section,
make friends, and let
us all be here together.
- We think about you guys all day.
We do 'cause we are constantly talking
about filming or editing.
We think about you guys,
and we see your comments,
and we read them especially

I'm always trying to like your comments,
so you know that I've read them.
It's just been a really fun four years.
It's crazy to see our Christmas evolve
from Jackson when he got
his rocks and a rock book
to now where he has a few
more presents to open.
-  A rock tumbler.
- You know, it's been fun
to see our family grow,
and to see footage.
- Yeah, and not only
that, but it's fun to see
how far along you have come with us.
Some of you, this may
be your very first day,
but some of you may have
been here for four years.
Four years, that's a long time.
-  Four Christmases.
- Yeah, four Christmases with us.
Thank you for being here with us.
I don't know why that just put the switch.
- We're raising our family,
and we're trying to figure out
how to raise a family,
and we're doing this,
and it's two emotional things.
It's been so fun.
- We love you, and we
are grateful for you,
so thank you for being here with us,
and I hope you guys stick around
because we've got a lot of
fun stuff coming up in 2018.
It's going to be a great
year, but we'll get into that
more later when it gets
closer to New Years,
but for now from our family
to yours Merry Christmas.
Have a wonderful holiday.
- Be safe.
- And, we will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
