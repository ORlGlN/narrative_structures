- Baby?
And point to my stomach
and I go, yeah, it's
the baby, he goes I see.
(laughing)
-  Boo.
(Jared laughs)
(laughing)
- I'm not gonna do what you want.
(laughing)
So when I wake up, I
always brush my teeth,
especially before I do
my make-up and get ready,
because, and that's just kind of not fun,
if brush your teeth after you've like
gotten ready for the day, you know?
So I went to go brush my teeth today,
but I've been dry heaving a lot
and so, I'm just gonna
have to brush it later.
And I put a piece of candy in my mouth
because I think my stomach
is just really upset,
and this, I don't even
know what else to say
other than that, I just feel,
I just need to get ready.
I always feel better when I get ready.
Like I don't want to get ready,
but I feel like if I do,
it'll give me that kick
and push for the day.
I have my mom's grandma's silverware,
cinnamon sticks, and
mom said to grab cloves.
I think that's like all I have.
Okay, we are getting ready
to take a few more
pictures for our cookbook
this morning.
I'm heading over the Bonnie's.
It's just like a few small things
of what you can eat around the holidays.
So here we go.
I just touched the Christmas tree
and Lincoln goes, don't touch it!
(gasps)
Your mama's looking.
(laughing)
You've been trained, huh,
not to touch the tree.
That was so funny.
I literally was over here
looking at ornaments,
he's like don't touch it.
- That's some cow.
(laughing)
-  Got that in the oven, bean dip.
Brownies, soup, wassail,
brittle and popcorn.
- I just--
- Are you waiting for me to move?
- No I was trying to hit the record button
as fast as I could
and I was gonna be like bink.
(laughing)
But your bum got out of the way.
Oh here, freeze,
bing.
(laughing)
I feel like we need a
little laughter after--
-  We do need a little laughter.
- after this weekend has been so crazy.
Just with this whole situation
that Bonnie has been going through.
You guys probably saw her video
about the demonetization.
and we've like literally been working
around the clock trying
to figure this out,
and figure out what we need to do,
and like Bonnie and Joel said,
we support YouTube cleaning up their--
- Absolutely.
- Their videos and everything,
but we've just been working hard at this
and now our brains are
ready for a little break
and laughter, like that.
- It was nice having you guys over here.
- I'm not laughing at you
flicking my wife's bum.
- Yeah.
- Oh sorry, I didn't even
see you there Joel, uhhh.
We also have some chips and dip
and some bananas and yogurt,
so the snacks are in a plenty
at Bonnie and Joel's house,
but we're done for the day
so time to go.
Thanks guys.
- Yeah, please leave.
- Quickly, just kidding.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- It's funny, the one time I don't have
my Apple watch on is
the time when I'm like
oh man, I really wish I
had it for this thing,
but then I don't need it for this thing,
because I can just do it,
I'm doing it right now.
There's a breathe app, on the Apple watch,
where it reminds you to just sit back
and just take one minute and breathe
and focus on your breath.
(squeaking toy)
And I feel like today,
this weekend especially,
I've just needed to take
a minute and breathe.
So I'm outside with Penny
and we're having fun
throwing the ball around.
And I'm just looking over
the beautiful sunset,
like holy cow, does that
look like it's straight
out of a Bob Ross painting or what?
And I'm just out here,
breathing in the nice
(squeaking toy)
cool crisp air, while Penny is squeaking.
(laughs)
Talk about relaxing, right?
But it's just, I need to remind myself
every once in awhile
to just stop for one minute and breathe.
Know that you can handle everything
that is coming your way,
that you just take
things one step at a time
and you can handle things.
Every day is a new day
and you can go through it,
just one step at a time,
one breath at a time.
Write things down, cross 'em off the list
and you can do it, so,
I'm out here, and I'm gonna take a minute
and breathe with the squeaky
toy in the background.
Penny, you're crazy.
Okay.
Goose Rubba.
(laughs)
(whispers) He's coming in right now.
Boo.
(Jared laughs)
Hi buddy.
How are you?
- Hi.
- Good.
- I love you so much.
- I love you.
- Did I scare you a little bit?
- Yeah.
- Are you so happy to see me?
- Yeah.
- I'm so happy to see you.
- What are you doing?
- I'm kneeling here on
the ground filming you
is what I'm doing.
- But what are you gonna do next?
- I'm gonna give you a
big ole hug and kiss.
(laughs)
- Now what next?
- Now what next?
Maybe we'll--
(whispers) Oh let's be so
quiet because Calvin is asleep.
Hi Calvin.
He's sleeping.
What should we do next?
Should we slide on the ground?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get my blanket.
- Okay.
-  Okay.
Let's go.
(twangy music)
- Where is it?
-  I think it's on our bed.
Okay, you got it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's see your slide.
Okay, laying it out right there,
Oh and you go for the
wind up and everything?
The running start,
on your mark, get set, go.
(Jared laughs)
Go.
(Jared laughs)
Can Daddy try?
Does that hurt your bum?
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you're home.
I missed you so much.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- You have to be quiet,
Calvin's asleep, you have to be quiet.
You have to be quiet, Calvin's asleep.
- That tickles.
-  Look I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- It's actually really late,
I should wake him up,
but he did not sleep last night.
-  No he didn't sleep
very good last night, huh?
All the sleep he can get is good.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna do something crazy.
I'm gonna attempt to
kiss him on the head--
-  No.
- without waking him up.
No I can't do it, no I can.
- This is giving every mom anxiety.
(laughing)
(footsteps)
- There's moments that live down
in Ellie and Jared history
and I think this is
one of them right here.
This is the intro to one of our videos
and I have to show it to you.
I have a question for you buckaroo.
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for the day?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah!
(Jared laughing)
That's just like my favorite--
- Motivational toddler.
- Yeah, motivational toddler,
that's my favorite thing.
Jackson was so, and still
is, so enthusiastic,
and I love it.
And there's one more thing,
Ellie shared it on her Instagram.
It's just so sweet and just like shows
how much our kids love each other.
And I want to show it to you
so it'll can melt your heart too.
Are you gonna give me a kiss?
Say bye bye.
- Baby.
-  Say baby.
Oh do you want to give Calvin a kiss?
Give him his binky back.
(Jared laughing)
Like how cute is that?
- And Calvin smiles.
- I know.
Jackson takes out his binky,
he's like no I'm kissing you on the lips
if I'm kissing you.
It's just so sweet and I love
that we have these videos to look back on
and see all of these changes, you know?
- Yes, and even Calvin,
I've talked about this too,
but (sighs)
everyday, Calvin kisses me, hugs me,
cuddles me, comes out
of the blue and hugs me,
and he always says Mama's baby.
And lately, he's been not
only been saying Mama's baby
and then he'll go baby?
And he'll point to my boobs
and I'm like no, and he goes baby?
And point to my stomach and I go yes,
the baby and he goes, I see?
And he lifts up my shirt
and he looks at my tummy
and he pats my tummy
and he goes baby.
And it's so cute.
And then he lifts up his shirt,
and says baby on his stomach.
- He hasn't done that to me yet,
except for that one time
over there, but so anyway.
-  So cute.
- Hey boys, we love you.
- But go to bed.
- Little punks.
(laughing)
- Mama's baby.
- Yeah Mama's baby.
- Why are you so sweet?
- Is that what you always
say to me, every day?
- Yeah.
- Is Jackson my baby?
- Yeah.
- And Calvin's my baby?
- Yeah.
-  And where's the other baby?
(Calvin vocalizing)
- Where's the baby?
_ where did it go?
- In your tummy?
That's silly.
- Yeah.
- Where's my baby?
In my tummy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I asked Jackson to go get in his jammies
a minute ago and he did.
Come here.
And then he went back downstairs.
Watch the water.
And he put on this outfit.
Why did you get dressed?
- Because.
-  Because you wanted that outfit?
- But you know we're
getting ready for bed.
- But I can sleep in gold ones.
-  You want to
sleep in your gold pants?
- Uh-huh.
- Like why is that so funny.
He totally changed back into clothes.
You're silly.
You can wear the shirt to bed,
but I think we should
find something comfy.
- But I have something comfy.
-  Okay.
Okay mister, let's go to bed.
- Okay.
-  Okay.
I'll come down and put you to bed.
- No I don't want to go to bed.
- You're going to bed.
- I don't want to go to bed.
- You don't want to go to bed?
-  No.
- Okay, watch a movie
for two more minutes.
-  No five.
- Five?
-  Six.
- Six?
-  Four.
- Oh Dad says four, Dad rules all.
No one's looking at the clock.
I just will go down when I feel like it.
(festive music)
- I'm not gonna give you a kiss.
- No you have to.
- I'm not gonna do what you want.
(laughing)
- I have to dip you,
you can't just throw your body back.
There you go.
(laughing)
Look at our merch, like
you're blue and I'm read,
I feel like we're like double dragon.
- I think I'm in love
with the cookie ones.
- Or like I'm Goku and you're Vegeta.
- What?
Okay I don't know what
you're talking about.
I'm brushing my--
- Probably 99% of our audience
doesn't know what I'm talking about.
- Okay good, I don't either.
I'm brushing my teeth.
- I just nerded a little bit, I'm sorry.
-  Makes me so sick.
- I'm sorry.
-  Isn't that the weirdest thing?
- I guess a little bit.
But it's good for you.
-  I know, that's why I'm doing it.
I haven't missed a day of flossing
since my last dentist appointment.
And we have a dentist
appointment next month,
so I hope I have major improvements.
But I think that's gonna
be it for us tonight.
We're tired.
We're gonna go straight to bed.
Maybe if there's a This is
Us online, we'll watch it.
- I think there is.
- Okay.
Thanks for watching guys.
- I don't know, go see,
and then we'll tell them if there is.
- Okay.
(Ellie laughs)
(muffled mumbling)
According to the Hulu app,
we are all caught up on This is Us,
however, we do have a couple episodes
of Modern Family, and Rick and Morty.
-  No
- Okay.
That is gonna be it from us tonight,
because we don't have
a This is Us to watch,
so we're gonna say goodnight.
Thanks for watching guys.
You just cut off all my lighting.
Say goodbye Ellie.
- Bye.
- Goodnight Kevin, bye.
