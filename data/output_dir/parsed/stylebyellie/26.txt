- So this has never happened to me before
in my whole entire life as a parent.
(grunts) Oh! Oh!
Yeah, woo! (laughs)
Yay!
Good job.
Good morning, guys!
How are you?
-  Good.
Good?
Hey, who has the craziest hair here today?
-  Calvin.
- Calvin does?
Is your hair crazy, or
is Daddy's hair crazy?
Or is Jackson's hair crazy?
(laughs)
Hey, guess what.
So, Mommy went to the doctor today,
and they cut her toe!
-  Aww.
- Yeah, so her toe is
probably going to get hurt.
She had what's called an ingrown toenail.
-  And you might feel
this, so tell me if you do.
-  Yeah, a little.
-  I'll try to make it so you only
feel the first one.
-  'Kay, that would be nice.
I mean, I've had babies, so it's okay.
But stuff like this still,
whoa, really sucks. (groans)
- And the doctors fixed it today,
so she might be in a little bit of pain
when she gets home from the doctor today.
-  Okay.
- So when she gets home,
let's be so nice to Mom.
Let's make sure she has
everything she needs,
and make her extra comfortable.
Can we do that?
- Yeah.
- Can we be a good team?
-  Yeah.
-  Mm-hmm.
- Good, that's my boys!
Look at this, we're a team of boys,
and we're gonna add one to the squad.
We're gonna be the boy squad.
Teen boy squad!
That's like a Homestar Runner,
that didn't really work all that great.
If you guys know Homestar Runner,
then you know the Teen Girl Squad,
but this is not a girl
squad, this is a guy squad.
So, anyway! (laughs)
Let's be nice to Mommy today, okay, boys?
-  'Kay.
- 'Kay, I love you.
-  I love you.
- I love you!
(all laugh)
(kisses)
So this has never happened to me before
in my whole entire life as a parent.
What are you doing?
Are you pushing me?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, why are you pushing me?
- Um, foot.
-  Your foot?
- No, your foot.
- He's pushing my feet.
He pushed me from my
office, where I was working,
all the way downstairs to grab this
so you could have more what?
- Up the stair.
-  Up the stairs to
get chocolate milk, huh?
-  Mm-hmm.
- He grabbed me and pushed me,
he's like, "Dad, follow me, I
need you to do this for me."
It was the sweetest, kind of the most
interesting thing, ever.
(laughs)
Hey, is this what you want?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, where do you want it?
In your cup?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Okay. Okay, you hold it.
Good job. Do you wanna pour it?
- Uh huh.
- Okay.
Let's be so careful, and I'll help you
pour it into here, okay?
- 'Kay.
- Go slow, slow, good job!
Good job, Calvin, you did it!
- It big!
- Yeah, it's big chocolate milk!
You got a lot, huh.
That was great work!
Daddy helped you, but you did good, huh?
- They cut my toenail.
They fixed it, so it's gonna
be like this for a little bit.
Will you guys be able to take care of me?
-  Yeah.
- You will?
You'll take care of me?
-  What is this one
right here?
-  So Calvin, if
I need chocolate milk,
will you go get me some?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Okay.
-  Does it look like
Mommy has a really big toe?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah.
-  You can touch
it, you gotta just be soft.
-  So soft.
Did it hurt?
-  No, um, a lot,
don't squeeze. (chuckles)
You're being a little kid!
A lot of people were like,
"It's gonna hurt super bad
"when you get it numbed,"
like, that's the worst part.
It wasn't bad, like, he
did a really good job.
He's like, "The slower
I go, it won't hurt."
It was the initial
poke, I was like, "Ahh!"
But it wasn't, it really
didn't hurt that bad.
-  That's good.
-  But she said
the numbness wears off,
I'll be hurting.
- Oh yeah. Was it my dad who
just recently had this done?
He was like, "Oh yeah, it was
the worst pain in the world."
So either you're really
tough, or my dad's a wuss.
I think my dad's a wuss. (laughs)
-  Um, so yeah, I just
need to be careful with it.
-  Yeah.
Oh, well I'm sorry that this
is gonna have to be like this.
How long do you have
to keep the bandage on?
-  'Til tomorrow night.
-  Oh, that's not too bad.
- And then just be
careful for a few weeks.
Here Jackson, give me a hug.
I love you!
Are you guys gonna help me?
Do you got an ow?
(Calvin babbles)
You just want the extra attention, too!
(Ellie and Jared laugh)
-  'Kay, let's be
extra good to Mommy today
and get whatever she needs, all right?
We should get her food?
- Yeah.
-  That's a great idea, Jackson!
Mom, what would you like?
- Um, we should make another meal.
-  That sounds great.
'Kay, let's get to it.
-  The entertainment
that the kids are giving us.
(laughs) They have done this 100 times.
I'm just sitting here, with my foot up.
You guys are crazy.
- Oh, Ellie!
I've got another surprise for you!
-  Is it nail polish?
- Do you want me to bring it down?
-  Sure.
- Okay!
Boy, we are just getting
lucky with timing this week.
First, Hello Fresh could not
have come at a better time,
and Ellie just had her
little toe procedure done,
her foot procedure done,
and I think this may be
very special to her today.
Let's go give it to her.
-  What?
- I've got something behind my back.
Jackson, hurry, turn on
the light so Mom can see.
-  I think I know what it could be!
-  No, you don't
know, it's a surprise!
Turn on the light.
-  The once a month
Bump Box that you got me?
- No, how'd you know?!
-  I saw the transaction
come out of the bank.
-  Oh! (laughs)
- Jared!
-  Let's open it,
let's see what's inside!
Oh, do you need a pocket knife?
- Yeah.
-  You better believe
I have a pocket knife
in my pocket.
- I'll do this, and then you can open it.
This was such a nice thing, Jared.
Daddy get this for Mom?
What is it?
-  What?
Look at all that.
- I got chipotle green chips.
-  Yum.
- I got a Bella B Glowing
Skin Lightening Cream.
-  Yeah.
- Prevention of fading, pregnancy mask.
Polished to perfection?
-  Yeah, you get
that perfection, girl!
- Anti-blemish facial
wash, what do they think,
when you get pregnant, you get acne?
You do! (laughs)
Do you?
-  Jen, have you been getting acne?
- Uh, not as much as I did with my boys.
-  Oh, yeah.
-  What?!
- But yes, I do.
- Bath soak, lavender,
organic frankincense.
-  Yum.
- Oh, frankincense.
-  Jesus got
frankincense when he was born.
-  He sure did.
-  Yeah.
- Energy body lotion.
-  Wow!
- Mom, she got this.
- What's this?
-  That looks like it's cool.
-  It's a picture.
-  Oh, it's a
frame for an ultrasound.
- Is that where we should
put the baby's picture?
-  Yeah.
-  That's cool.
What a fun box.
- Jared!
-  Happy Bump Box day.
- Jared did this, I didn't even,
he did this all on his own.
You're so cute to me.
- Well, I just love you very, very much.
- And then I asked him, I was
like, "Was this sponsored?
Did you get this?"
It wasn't.
-  No, it wasn't.
It's not, it's just fun.
- You're cute.
- It's fun to get little surprises
when you completely forget about them.
- Yay, confetti!
-  Confetti, throw
it up in the air, Jackson!
Yay!
Hey, it's a good thing we can use
one of three vacuums to get that. (laughs)
- We're gonna vacuum! (laughs)
-  Wow!
-  Come on, Nixon,
you join in the fun!
He's like, oh it's very, very messy.
Maybe one of these nights
before Jennifer goes home,
you could use one of those masks.
Is there a mask in there
or something like that?
-  That would be fun.
-  You girls
can, like, I don't know.
- I heard the word mask, but I don't--
- We could do a bubble bath together.
-  There you go.
You can, like, you and Bonnie, and watch
The Bachelor Winter Olympics,
'cause there's someone
from Finland on there, is what I heard.
- Yeah, they're beautiful.
- Yeah, so that's gonna be fun.
You kids play with your
confetti for a minute,
and then we'll vacuum it up.
Boys, guess what!
- What?
-  The girls have gone out.
And you know what that means?
- Yeah.
- It's the boy's time to party!
We're gonna party, we're gonna party!
Show me how you party.
Yeah, woo! (laughs)
The girls are gone, what
do you guys wanna do?
Calvin's asleep, pshh!
Can you believe that?
What do you guys wanna do?
- Play!
-  You wanna play?
- No, I wanna go outside in the front.
-  Well, I don't think
Cannon has his snow clothes,
so maybe we should go downstairs and play!
- Yes!
-  Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
-  All right, let's
go, let's go downstairs
and we'll play, this is
gonna be so much fun,
playing with our cousins,
having a great time
while the girls do boring
stuff like shopping,
can you believe that?
- Yeah, even I wanna play
a game with you and Cannon.
- Let's do it!
Jackson, where's that football?
Let's play football!
We can pass it around to each other.
- I can't find it.
-  Let's go look for it.
Oh, there's so many cars, look
at all these Hot Wheel cars.
It's almost like Godzilla went
through and rampaged here.
You found it, good job!
Let's throw it to each other.
Oh, got it! Nice.
Cannon, are you the firefighter
for the day, or the farmer?
- A firefighter.
-  Firefighter? Yeah.
(grunts) Oh, got it, yes!
(grunts) Oh, you got
me right in the tummy!
Oh, it hurts so bad,
oh, right in the tummy!
Hey, good catch, bud, you did it!
High five! High five!
Hey, nice catch!
- Nice catch!
-  (laughs)
Oh, oh, what a line drive.
Oh my goodness, it's a
masterpiece, it's a masterpiece!
This night is about to
get 10 times better.
It's pizza night!
Who's having a good time today?!
Yay!
It's pizza night, and every
pizza night is a great,
great night, because pizza's
delicious and I love pizza.
Raise your hand if you love pizza!
Hey, we got a good solid
crowd out here tonight,
thanks for joining us, we're
gonna have a great time,
do you like Pizza?
-  Raise your
hand if you like pizza.
- Oh! He's more of a mac
and cheese kind of guy.
-  I do, I do!
-  Yeah, there's our
volunteer for the evening.
Don't worry, folks, I'm your
tonight's entertainment,
and I'll be here all evening.
So when we got here, we
noticed that the Smurfs movie
was playing on Grandma and
Grandpa's TV, and Jackson,
what did you ask me about the Smurfs?
- Why are they wearing socks?
-  Why are they
wearing socks on their head?
- Yeah.
-  Do you think it's maybe to cover
the toes on their head?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah? (laughs)
Is that silly?
You think it looks like a hat?
- Uh-huh.
-  What do you think it
looks like under their hats?
Or their socks?
- Underwear.
-  Underwear? (laughs)
(Jackson singing)
(laughs) That's a good job, bud.
Are you singing Believer?
-  Yeah.
♪ Make me a, you make me a believer ♪
-  That was good.
Should we get our pajamas
on, and get a book?
-  Ka-chow!
-  Ka-chow is right!
Calvin's loving you so
much, isn't he? (laughs)
- He's scratching me.
-  Did you guys
have a good day today?
-  Yeah.
-  What was your
favorite part of the day?
- Going to Grandma's house.
-  Going to Grandma's house.
That was so much fun,
I'm glad you had fun.
- Goodnight, friends.
- Night, friend!
- We are saying goodnight to
the boys with a classic book,
The Little Blue Truck Halloween.
(gasps) Little Blue
Truck was your favorite
as a little kid, Jackson.
Did you know that?
And this Halloween one is fun, too.
So let's read this,
and we'll say goodnight
to our friends again, okay?
-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Under the mask, who do you see?
- Quack, it's me, it's me.
-  Quack, quack, quack,
it's me, it's me. (laughs)
- Oh, he keeps bending them!
-  Oh, we'll fix it, don't worry.
You get to do the next one, 'kay, bud?
Who's this clown with a big red nose
and a cap that jingles wherever he goes?
Under the mask, who do you see?
-  Bah says the
sheep, it's me, it's me.
-  Bah says the
sheep, it's me, it's me!
Your face looks like it's in pain.
How is your body doing?
- Well, first, my stomach's killing me.
- Hold on one second.
Hey, Siri, stop the music.
Nice.
What were you saying there, sweetheart?
- So first, my stomach is killing me.
It's funny how there are some things
you never have when you're pregnant,
and then the next pregnancy, you're like,
I have to have that.
I totally want, like, a belly support.
My stomach, I'm like, it is so heavy.
-  Yeah.
-  And it hurts so bad right now.
-  It's cute.
You look good pregnant.
How's your toe doing?
-  It's killing me.
-  Aw, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, this morning, I was
like, "That was awesome."
-  And now you're like--
-  Now I'm like, owie shiz.
It hurts super bad.
-  I'm sorry.
So when you do this
again for your next toe,
are you gonna do things differently?
- No.
-  No? You're not
gonna take it any easier
or anything like that?
- I feel like I did.
-  Yeah, kinda like
kept it elevated and stuff?
- Um, yeah.
I was so confused why they
couldn't do both of them.
Like, I was wanting them to just do
both of them today so I could just
be done.
-  Be done with it?
- And she's like, "No, you're
not gonna want to do that."
I was like, "Okay."
- I imagine it's like the dentist,
they don't want to numb both sides,
because then you're numb on
both sides, you don't want to--
- Yeah, 'cause then for two weeks,
it's, she says it's tender for two weeks,
but just, I think, the
next few days is the worst.
-  Yeah.
- But, like, I definitely,
like, it's tender.
-  It looks like
you have a giant toe.
-  It looks like
I'm flipping you off.
-  With your giant toe.
- Yeah, 'cause I am.
-  That's, like, super vulgar.
Geez, why are you so rude all the time?
- Jared.
-  Meh! (laughs)
- Do you get what I'm
trying to say right now?
Bend over! (both laugh)
- So guys, I think
that's where we're going
to end the vlog today.
And before we do, there's a couple things.
I just wanted to say that we're grateful
for your support now, and especially
over the past four and a half years.
This is the first time we've done
something like this, and
it's gonna take some--
-  Where we've
changed our schedule.
-  Yeah, it's
gonna take some time--
- We've never done that.
- For us to adjust, just as much as
it's gonna take some time for
you guys to adjust to that.
So we're gonna do this together,
it's gonna take some time.
But it might feel weird for a little bit,
but it's gonna be great.
And I'm very, very excited.
So bear with us, we'll bear with you,
and we'll just be bears together.
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.
(laughs) Thanks for watching, guys.
We are gonna call it a night.
Bye.
