-  You ready for this?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
- K, ready, Jar?
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready,
by the grace of everything.
- Let me get a little water.
-  K, get in a sip, and then--
- Make sure you stay hydrated, young man.
- Gonna get a drink, and
then we're gonna head out.
We have been working the last few days
from eight A.M. 'til six at night.
We've been filming some
really fun projects.
Today, we are finishing
up one of those projects.
It is a giving.
It is a service project
that we were able to work
with a company and combine
and do something really big
for some fun people.
That's where we're going right now
after we fight over the water.
We're all gonna get in the car,
and we're gonna head out
and surprise some families,
and I'm really excited to do that.
(gentle music)
-  Good donut?
- So good. You want a bite?
-  Yes, I want a bite.
-  Oh, you got donut.
- He's like mouthful already.
Oh, wow, let me have another bite.
- This is the best donut.
It's like a scone.
- Yeah, it's so stinking good.
- It's just like a scone.
-  Yeah, that's a sconut.
Ooh.
-  Dad, the cape.
(gentle music)
-  Come here, come here, come here.
-  Come here, boys.
Hi, Jackson.
-  Are we gonna get ready?
-  You ready for this?
- Yeah!
-  Hi, Cal.
Hi, bud.
-  Guess it will
look right in here.
-  Yeah, it's
good in the middle, but--
-  Hi.
Jackson, you are doing so
good with the snowflake.
You're following the lines and everything.
Good job, bud.
(gentle music)
Ellie, I could never
make a gingerbread house
like these guys.
Like, look at that.
-  That's fun.
- It's the teamwork that
makes the dream work.
- There you go.
That's a lesson to live by.
Yeah, you put that on a t-shirt.
Sell it on Teespring.com.
(crosstalk)
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.
- My dad.
- Yours?
- Yeah.
- Well, find it, and that
is a wrap on the day.
That is a wrap on the day.
We are all done.
(laughs)
Ellie's wrapping up with some pie.
- Yes, pie, soup.
We are pooped.
- Pooped.
We're at The Pie Dump, and
we're pooped eating pie.
- Poopoo.
- That's the cutest name
for a restaurant: Pie Dump.
- Yeah, The Pie Dump.
Well, and what we didn't
know until today is, like,
Joel would come here all the time.
They have the best rolls.
They have amazing pies, and,
everyone in the community,
this is their hangout, which is so fun.
We're gonna have to come here more often.
- Yes, so far so good.
(laughs)
Remember how little she was a year ago?
Like, under the tree and fireplace.
She was just under the couch.
- I remember the first picture
we took was right here,
her looking up right here.
She would fit underneath the couch.
-  Now, she's chomping on a treat.
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Those little
things are the coolest.
It's like a ball that you put a treat in,
and it occupies her.
- Yeah, well, it's--
-  For a minute.
- It's a little mental
and physical stimulation.
She's had such a fun day.
She's been playing with
her buddies all day today
at doggie daycare.
- Yeah, she went to a little daycare today
while we finished filming,
because today was sun up
'til sun down filming.
We brought you along a little bit.
I don't even know if it made sense.
We had a really fun day.
We're gonna have a main
video of that coming out
in the few weeks, I think, but--
- We'll let you know for sure
exactly when it's coming out
so you can be ready for it.
- Yes.
She got the treat out of the.
(laughs)
- That took 30 seconds.
- Our vlogs the last
few days have not been
the typical vlogs at home,
but we have been working on
some side projects that
have been really fun
that will go up in a couple of weeks.
We are home now.
The kids are in bed.
Our minds, our mental
stimulation the last few days
of filming has been overwhelming but fun.
It's been fun to see
there's just so many jobs,
and it's just fun.
Oh, she found her toy.
She found her toy.
Was that on the counter?
-  It was on her bed, I think.
- You find your toy.
It was fun to see, but
our house was filled
with, like, 15 crew people
and all these cameras
and equipment, and I just was thinking,
"Look at all these jobs they have".
Look at all the jobs that
people have coordinating
even, like, what we did
this weekend and then us,
and it just was a really
cool experience for us,
and Penny really likes this
experience of her new toy.
Side note, Magna-Tiles,
we've had those for a year
and a half, and the boys
literally have been playing
with them for hours, and
she just got a diaper.
They've been playing with them for hours
building garages for their cars.
So cute.
- And it's funny, because
it just clicked for Jackson.
He's like, "Okay, I can
have fun and build things
"with these toys," so it's
like we had them for so long,
but, now, he's so interested in 'em,
and I wanna say the next
progression after that
is gonna be LEGO.
You know, Magna-Tiles, then maybe LEGOS.
- I hope so.
I kinda keep--
- I know.
I'm kinda crossing my fingers for that.
- We have a little box of LEGOS downstairs
that my mom got out when
she was with the kids,
and she's like, "They
actually really liked 'em,"
and he's been liking carrying
'em around in baggies,
but he likes holding 'em,
but he doesn't really like
playing with them a whole ton.
That could be the next step.
I think LEGOS are fun.
- What are the Du, Duplo, Duplox?
Is that like the bigger LEGO?
-  I think so.
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I don't know, but these are cool.
We have a small set of 'em.
-  We need to get more.
- That is our vlog, guys.
Thank you so much for watching.
Like I said, it's kinda
been a little funny
the last few days, but we're
getting into Thanksgiving,
and I'm very excited.
-  Do you wanna know something?
- What?
- I'm grateful for you.
-  Thank you.
- I was gonna say, like, "Do
you wanna know something,"
and it's gonna be this
long, mystical thought.
Nope, I'm just grateful for you.
- Thank you, and I truly
am grateful for you,
and we're not, like, it's so funny,
'cause, when you first
say it, I'm like, "Ugh,"
but I know you mean it, because
you say that a lot to me.
- I want you to know that
I'm grateful for you.
- And I am grateful for you.
- You know, I want you to know that,
and I want you to know that
I'm grateful for her, too,
because I am so much.
(laughs)
- K, guys.
- We're so weird.
- Roll your eyes, 'cause
I rolled mine halfway.
I do love you.
- Well, I love you too.
- And we're gonna go take a hot bath.
We're gonna put our feet in the bath, k.
- Put our feet in the bath.
- We'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
- Bye!
