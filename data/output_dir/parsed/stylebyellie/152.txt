-  Do you want
to play hide and seek?
-  No.
-  Okay.
- I don't know if you can hear the kids
down there playing.
But Jackson goes Calvin, do
you want to play hide and seek?
And Calvin goes no.
And Jackson goes okay.
I'm gonna head out, slip
out before they see me,
I'm gonna go get my hair done,
I'm gonna get it trimmed and freshened up.
Video's up.
- Video's up, working
on some special videos
for this week, because I mentioned
we'll have some other videos
going up next week, so.
- Woo hoo, have fun.
- Thanks, love you.
Have fun getting your hair done.
- Thanks.
- Hey you know what?
Just go have fun and relax
and take all the time that you want, okay?
- Why are you so cute to me?
- Because I love you and I want you
to have time for yourself
and just
- Well thanks.
- I'll take care of the kids
and we'll have fun, okay?
-  Okay.
You have fun.
- I love you.
- I will.
- You do a little challenge with the kids.
- Ooh that sounds fun.
-  Remember when I
snuck into my mom's house.
Remember when Bonnie
was so funny that day?
(Ellie laughs)
- So here's the deal.
Last night I made dinner.
Did not do any of the clean up.
The kitchen's a disaster.
I'm gonna clean up,
so I've got the kids downstairs,
they're playing, they're
having a fun time.
They're like sliding across the trampoline
onto a mat, it's hilarious.
I'll show you that in a second.
But I've got tons of
stuff to clean up here
in the kitchen.
So let's initiate a fun montage.
Oh I know just the thing, hold on.
Okay google, play some cool music.
-  Sure,
here's a Google Play
music radio mix, based on
the cool jazz one playlist.
- Cool jazz, I like that very much.
Now we can start cleaning.
Let's get this place cleaned up
before Ellie gets home.
That's the goal.
(bright jazzy music)
Do you boys want to know what
song popped into my head?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Head, nose.
- Is that your head and nose?
An old song popped into my head
that I haven't sung in
a very very long time.
And Jackson you might know it,
But Calvin you might not remember it.
It goes a little something like this,
♫ Corn dogs corn dogs
♫ They are so good to me
♫ Corn dogs
Ring any bells?
(laughing)
Well at any rate, guess what guys?
I found these in the freezer,
so we're gonna have some
corn dogs for lunch.
Does that sound good?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's have some corn dogs.
What is it Penny?
You okay?
She senses something.
Oh my gosh Penny, you are going crazy.
Oh off off off off.
She is so excited about something.
(barking)
What is it?
(barks)
Is it outside?
(Jared laughs)
She's never like this.
She's going crazy and
she never barks inside,
and she is holding it
back as much as she can,
but she can't.
You okay, huh?
I think I know what it is.
I think I know why she's acting this way,
but I want to double check first.
We might as well call
him chameleon Calvin,
because he's adapting to every move
that Penny is making.
Are you a puppy?
Come here puppy, come here puppy dog.
Hi puppy dog.
Have you been a good boy?
That's a good doggie.
My suspicions were correct.
So this is what's going on.
Penny is going crazy,
she's barking a lot outside,
she's running just back and forth,
like you guys saw earlier.
I told Ellie what was happening
and I was like I wonder
if our neighbor's dog
is having puppies today.
So Ellie texted our neighbors
and that is actually true.
They have eight puppies right now
and Penny either heard the puppies
or she just sensed it.
Yeah, she just sensed it.
-  She's excited.
- Yeah, she's so excited right now.
- Did your friend have puppies?
You played with her, huh.
Yeah, that is so fun.
-  It is fun, it's really exciting.
- We don't want her barking.
So she's gonna be in,
- yeah.
- we will watch her a little closer.
- Yeah, those are brand new puppies
and we want to make sure they're comfy
and our dog isn't barking
all over the place.
Is that fun?
Did you best friend get
puppies, is that right Penny?
She's like there's food on the table now.
Everything else is less of a priority.
Nothing else matters,
there's food on the table.
- I got my hair done.
- How do you love it?
- It was good.
- She just rimmed it a little.
-  Is there a little color to it?
- A little color, so it should.
- It looks a little brighter, a little
- I came home and everyone
was having corn dogs
and I was like
- Yes.
- I'm gonna make myself some lunch.
- Hey, corn dogs are good.
- It was good.
- Yeah, for when Mom's gone,
that's what's fun, right?
-  Yeah exactly.
Ellie your hair looks amazing.
- Thank you.
- Like I really do like
that shoulder length bob?
- Lob, that's what people call it.
-  A lob?
Is that what they call it?
- Yeah.
- Just lob it over the plate,
just lob it over the
shoulders, that's all.
- Alright well let's try this again.
Calvin, do you want to wear your costume?
-  No.
- He doesn't want to wear it.
- He just said no.
- Okay well I guess Calvin just is
It's so weird to me.
Do you guy shave kids that don't want
to wear Halloween costumes?
- I always wanted to.
- Is that normal?
- I feel like all kids want to wear them.
Calvin, should we put your costume on?
- No.
-  What about Batman?
Do you want to wear a Batman outfit?
Do you want to wear your Batman costume?
That piqued his interest.
-  Okay should I
hurry and go find something?
- Let's go get his Batman costume.
- He wore it last year.
Oh, you okay?
- He slipped and fell down.
- Someone fell.
-  He fell down Dad.
- I don't know if it'll fit him,
but we might be able
to squeeze him into it.
Come here, we gotta go Jackson,
I gotta tell you where we're going.
Okay Calvin, look what I have.
- What?
-  Do you want Minion?
- No.
- Come here.
-  He wants Batman.
Do you want Batman?
- Do you want Batman?
- No Minion.
- No Minion.
- You want Batman?
Look see Batman?
- Come here.
-  Do you want the Batman one?
-  Batman.
- Okay I'm not fighting it, whatever.
-  You'll just go as Calvin.
(laughing)
- That's crazy to me.
Alright, do you want me to
tell you where we're going?
We're going to the church Halloween party.
- Woo!
- What?
That's creepy.
-  That's creepy?
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- I'm excited.
We brought a bunch of
snickerdoodle cookies.
- He always says that's amazing
or he'll say what?
I've never heard that's creepy.
Okay let's go.
-  This is our first
activity of the party.
- Dad can you hold these?
-  Yes I can hold these.
Okay Jen is gonna show
us how to do this okay?
- So what you're gonna do is
you're gonna pick up one
of these ping pong balls,
and you're gonna try to get it in the cup.
You gotta stand on the line, okay?
- Is this water pong?
Are we playing water pong?
(Jared laughing)
- Okay try to make it into the red cups
or the green cups.
-  Ooh that was close, try again.
Yay he got it in a red one.
Best day ever.
- Let me have this one.
-  Nice.
So let's pick a duck.
Let's see.
Does it have a dot on the bottom?
(Jared laughing)
Oh, just one duck, he ate all the ducks.
Can you believe that you have won
every single game that
you boys have played,
isn't this incredible?
- Want to play more games.
-  Guess what?
That's what we're gonna do.
- More games, more games.
-  Good job Jacks.
-  You guys are naturals.
-  What?
Bye Mr. Jacks,
have fun.
- Bye.
- Da da.
Da!
- Hey ya, are we both in our thermals?
- No.
- No?
Look, I'm wearing a onesie.
And look, my butt even has a little flap.
I picked this up today,
I think I'm gonna do a little haul but
I love that we're both
wearing little thermals.
- Owie, it's an owie bum.
- You got an owie on your bum?
- Mommy owie.
- I put an owie on your bum?
- Yeah.
- Are you telling
- Mommy
(laughing)
You got an owie on your bum
when you were in the tub,
'cause you fell, huh?
- Mommy bum.
-  My bum?
- Mommy.
- And I have a flap on my bum.
Come here.
Hey, come here.
- Where did Dad go?
-  Where did Dad go?
- Home.
- We had a blast at our church party.
Jared and Jackson actually
went to the pumpkin walk
to watch Grandpa sing again,
and it was getting late
and it is really cold,
so I thought that it would be good
to put Calvin to bed and for me
to just sit for a minute.
(footsteps)
Okay go to your night routine.
Jump on the bed, pick out a book.
So what book are we gonna read?
It's Pumpkin Day Mouse.
I used to read that
all the time to Jackson
and he laughed.
I think Jackson was about this age
when he would laugh so hard
at the boo part, so let's
see if Calvin laughs as hard.
Mouse has seven pumpkins to decorate.
Mouse paints a happy face on this pumpkin.
This pumpkin is sad.
Mmmm, one of these pumpkins are missing.
Eek!
What's that?
Eek!
Isn't it silly?
Wow.
Boo!
The dog made a scary pumpkin.
- Yeah.
- Now it's time to make friendly pumpkins.
Are they painting eyes?
- Eyes.
- Happy Pumpkin Day mouse.
- Eye.
Sad.
-  Sad?
- Yeah sad.
-  Aww he's sad.
- Yeah sad.
-  Yeah, and he's happy.
Are you sad?
- No.
- Before I end the vlog, I just wanted
to tell Christine thank you so much
for saying hi to me while
I was in town today.
Meeting you guys, it truly does
make it fun for Jared and I,
because it puts a face to a name
and in person and it really is special.
Tomorrow Jared and I have
an extra special day.
We are also meeting another viewer.
We are going to their home
and the kids are gonna play
and we'll tell you the whole
story about that tomorrow,
and I'm looking forward to that.
And I just, I've been sitting here,
I've been reading a book,
I've been getting ready for bed
and I'm truly happy with what we film.
And Jared and I only share and post
what we want to share
and a lot of it is maybe
the kids just playing
and in 10 years, in 20 years,
this is for me to look back.
And I love what we are doing
and I have seen, not
tons, but a few people
saying that they don't like
how we've been filming lately
or it's boring and I just want you to know
that first and foremost we are doing this
for ourselves and for
our kids to look back on.
And I personally have changed
up how I've been filming
the last few weeks, and
I have really enjoyed it.
Instead of filming lots of little clips
throughout the day and trying to show
what we're doing all day long,
I've been trying to focus
on just like two things
and making stories out of that,
like in the morning when I was cooking
all day the other day,
I was in the mood, and I wanted to show
you guys what I was doing,
so that turned out to be most of the vlog.
And so I've been trying
not to film so much
throughout the day and just focusing on
a few things to film.
So I've been happy with that
and I have felt much
more at peace doing that.
My brain and focusing on the kids
and focusing on filming,
and I've just been trying to capture
what I really want to capture,
rather than feeling the need to film
more of my day and I really love that.
So I know not a ton of
people have loved it,
but I also know that
there's a lot of people
who have been supportive,
but I'm just letting you
know at the end of the day,
I'm filming for myself to look back on
and I really have loved
what I've had to share
and thank you guys so
much for being supportive
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
Go eat a donut.
