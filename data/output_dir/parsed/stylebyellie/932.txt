it's crazy that a year ago was our first
convention here at vlogger fair and I
felt so timid and anxious and nervous
and I didn't mean and I do not every
convention like the night before I get a
really about stomachache and they just
and I like it's because I kind of am
nervous because it's a lot to take on
and I'm excited it's like all the
emotions so I'm excited jinx you owe me
a soda
so this is the green room and they
stuffed it up this chair this is so
awesome I mean all the conventions
should do this especially for the kids
so you come in and you have a few little
treats and it's food which is nice
because this morning I didn't eat
breakfast if you wanted to get here
really quick but you come in yeah if you
play pens and then everyone just kind of
chatting a little bit and then they hunt
like all of these this kid stuff but the
kids have a little bouncer but Calvin
and yes there that is a rat I don't know
it's creepy that's creepy there's a bear
another thing and then they have this
area for breast feeding so this will be
nice quiet and dark so this is really
nice so thank you so much Liz for
putting this together

go with the
but I ran into this young lady was a boy
thanks so much maybe a good day
so yeah shout-out to investment
my wife thank you baby
you're so good thing you purchase my
dinner a few times the biggest challenge
I face walking my kids I have to find
what I shouldn't but I have to remember
that my children are going to look back
on this and I don't I don't want to put
too much out there and this is
their precious lives in
you know security as well I think that's
the hardest part is figuring out what to
build and what not to film the surprise
the hardest part was funny memorable
logging moments you probably ended it
out maybe I told you I got to edit it
out because I died laughing but I
thought really about the poor dog all
the poor duck we need tough Jackson to a
country store and a beautiful baby
animal and they say the touch gently and
Jackson at the time was learning to be
pretty soft and so you know he was
really soft and as I was building I said
oh and he grabs that okay don't be too
sad but the duck was okay but I died
laughing Jared was like oh like he froze
I've never seen Jarrod react that way
like he was so startled before Doug we
put the duck down we recoup to Jackson I
think daddy and Jackson were pretty
pretty scared but that was one of the
funnier vlogging moments that we had is
it out
if the top was okay well they said three
hours and 15 you guys all did so but
when I see the people I stumble over my
right side oh yeah you know there were
shining star I appreciate everybody that
really does me a lot
the troubles be overcome
