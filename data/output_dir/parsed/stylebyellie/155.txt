- I just told Jared that I
win 10 wife points today.
I just ran to the store,
got a bunch of stuff
for Jared's trip, and I
am making Jared and Landon
some tin foil dinners.
But I guess I shouldn't
say I win 10 points,
'cause he wins 10 points
too, because he just did
two videos today so he
could do an overnight trip.
So, I am getting ready
for tin foil dinners
and I keep thinking,
we've used our fire pit
outside once, and I think
it'd be really fun to make
tin foil dinners outside with the boys.
I think that would be so fun soon.
But today is a fall, fall day.
It is a little chilly outside.
I've got my bats turned on, the lights,
and I have some bats over here too.
Jared is charging all of
his stuff for the trip,
but those are my little
bat lights that are out.
But this is actually really fun.
I haven't made a tin foil
dinner in like, several years.
When we first got married, we
went up to his family's cabin
and I made tin foil dinners then.
But, I don't think I've made 'em since.
- Yes, major, major wife points for Ellie.
She's helping out a ton.
I've been rushing like
crazy to get videos done,
uploaded, scheduled, and
packed, because we're takin'
this guy on an adventure this weekend.
It's gonna be so much fun.
My old box here is like totally broken,
and the frame is all bent
because it was like a bag
with a frame.
This is a hard shell (taps).
So I'm really excited
about all the more space
that I have in here.
Everything that I need
to stay over the weekend
is in here plus more clothes
and food for other people.
It's really, really great.
I'm about to head over to Joel's house.
We're gonna meet up and
we're gonna take off.
Gotta get some gas, but I am so excited.
This is like, this is
the funnest thing ever.
Alright kiddos, alright wife, say goodbye
to your favorite person in the world.
Muah!
(chuckles) I love you.
- I love you.
- Mm mm (kissing noises)
- Kiss dad.
Kiss daddy.
- Mm mm
- Kiss daddy.
- Muah! (laughs)
- Can you tell it's quiet time?
- It is quiet time.
- We're just resting.
-  Okay you all close your eyes.
Dream of great things of fun adventures,
and being good boys, okay?
-  Did you get
the best spots in town?
- May I introduce to you, Emma and Olivia!
- Woo! (clapping)
♫ I wish everybody on this island
♫ Seems so happy on this island
♫ So maybe I know I'm not
♫ And no one knows, how far I'll go
(cheering)
- Olivia, do a bow!
- The boys are officially
gone on this rainy day.
They headed out on their
little trip, and we are just
playing with the cousins and
getting ready to make food.
Julie has an awesome
dessert we're gonna make.
Bonnie has an awesome
dessert we're gonna make,
and I have an awesome
dinner we're gonna make.
So I think everybody's
happiness is fulfilled
'cause there was cousins and
all of our tummies will be--
- Full of sugar!
- Full of food!
(upbeat instrumental music)
(laughing)
- I just let Penny in.
And she may have accidentally
knocked Calvin over.
She's just excited.
- Woo!
(laughing)
- Got some music on.
Just tryin' to, everyone just relax.
♫ Better walk, better walk that walk baby
- What are you doin' if I was me?
- This is perfect for you to play with.
-  I think Cody wants
to play Play-Doh for a second.
- I think your mask is on backwards.
Your mask is inside out.
(indistinct conversations)
(upbeat instrumental music)
♫ - oh I won't give in
'till I reach the end
- Mister Jackson has been
a music party pooper,
but not now, I found a song that he loves.
Woohoo! And Cody!
Tell us what we're makin'.
- We're making ghost brownies.
-  K.
- No, put them in your
hands or their gonna melt.
So while it's wet you can make
a ghost face on the front.
So you put your eyes on, and the nose.
Does it look kind of like a ghost?
(laughing)
-  Cute.
- We'll pour your ghost on.
- Oh! It's sliding!
-  K. Can you put your
little eyeballs on it Jacks?
- Hey do you want to put them on?
Do you want me to help you with one eye?
- No, no
(laughing)
- Sorry.
-  Say, "no thanks"
- No thanks.
- Oh, you did so good!
(background conversation)
-  It looks good!
Now do a little nose right there.
(background conversation)
Ooh! Scary!
(laughing)
I said, "do you want a fork?"
He said, "no thanks", and
went right to the ghost.
It's a good way to eat it,
that way I don't have to do dishes.
- Biting, and spitting!
- Whose kids are worse?
(laughing)
Turn the camera off!
- You're kid did that to my child.
- We've had a lot of incidents today
when the cousins get together.
It's fun moments but it's also crazy.
Our days' been so fun, it's
kinda turned in to like,
a Halloween party in a way.
- [Bonnie and Julie in
Unison] Yeah! It's been fun.
(laughing)
- I made stuffed bell peppers for dinner,
Bonnie made a cute dessert,
and then we're gonna play...
Hey Calvin!
(laughing)
We are gonna play bingo with the kids now,
before we rap up and go to bed.
It's really why I think
our balance is really off,
but Jared's not here to look at it.
(inspirational music)
- We made it, we're here.
you may remember this from our last trip,
but we've got our fire going,
we've got the goodies on the table,
and this is really the
most important part of
the whole trip- the goodies, right?
- That's what we brought for dinner.
-  Yeah, so we've got
our buddies, Muddy Buddies.
(laughing)
I think once we get our
fingers a little bit more warm,
we're gonna go back out in to
the cold and try some fishing.
- Hey look it's our Grand Station.
-  Is that where we are?
- This is where we're at.
-  Nice!
(inspirational music)
-  Wow!
- Olivia, you pick up toys as we go.
- K! We are going to pick up the basement.
And then we're gonna play a game.
Can you help me pick up?
- What is it called?
- It's called "bingo".
- Bingo?
-  Yes.
- Yes!
- I love bingo
- I like bingo!
-  Okay! Aunt
Bonnie has job for you.
Hurry, hurry!
- So we've been fishing for what, I dunno,
45 minutes, half an hour?
And no ones caught anything,
no ones even had a nibble.
And the worst part about it,
it's not that we haven't caught any fish,
it's that we see the fish in the water,
right in front of us, and
their not doing anything.
They're just like, "I know
what you're trying to do,
"you're tryin' to do somethin' bad,
"and I don't like it one bit."
- Mocking fishes
-  Mocking us!
- They should at least
give us a curtesy nibble.
Like, we're out here freezing.
-  Yeah.
- (inaudible) Acknowledge it.
-  Yeah, acknowledge
that we're making an effort,
you know?
Well this is not exactly
how I expected it to go!
(laughing) We had all the
fishing poles on the back of
a 4-wheeler, and we have two out of three.
So I'm looking for a fishing pole,
my fishing pole that is, that
fell on the ground somewhere.
So, we're looking around now!
- Look at your tickets,
and if you have what I say,
you put it on your square.
- Should we each put one in the middle?
- And if you get five in a
row, that's when you win.
Everyone gets one free one in the middle.
Everyone put one in the
middle for the free one.
Ghost, do you have a ghost on there?
- Wait, I have the ghost!
- Good job!
- That's a skeleton.
- Everyone are you ready?
- Yes!
- Mummy
- Do you know what a mummy is?
- Yes I got a mummy!
- That's a mummy.
- A mummy is, like,
someone wrapped up in like,
toilet paper, like bandages.
(engine roars)
 Oh! There it is! Wooh!
Yeah! I found it! (laughing)
- Sorry.
- That's alright, here
we'll snap it back on here.
It probably just came right loose.
There we go.
-  Pumpkin
- Yes I found a pumpkin!
(kids laughing)
-  You don't have it!
Did you have a pumpkin Emma?
- (child) Yeah! Bingo! Bingo!
-  Pumpkin
-  K.
K.
-  Good job Cooper!
-  Does everyone
know what a headstone is?
- (excited chatter) yes!
- I get this one and I win?
-  You just need
one more and you win!
I am going to have to say, "spiderweb"
(excited chatter)
- Yes! I have spiderweb
-  Is there a difference between
a spiderweb and a spider?
-  Yes.
-  Okay.
- Spider.
- Yes! I got one, two, three,
four, five, six! I won!
- No
-  In a row,
Jackson did win that one!
- He did?
-  Did you? Yep, mummy, pumpkin,
free, stone, and then the spider.
Jackson!
♫ Hello darkness my old friend
Should we play again?
- The kids are like, ticked.
- Bingo! Bingo!
-  Oh my goodness gracious.
-  Yowsa!
-  Wow, that looks great!
That looks great, that looks great!
Tin foil dinners, guys.
- Guess what?
-  Huh?
- I have my own little special bowl,
that you get to choose prize out of.
So let's play again, and
see if someone else can win.
So when we're all done you
can choose a prize, okay?
- Can we switch cards?
-  Sure!
Are you ready mister? You ready?
- Can we put it on this
since we already cleared it off that time?
-  Yep, you'd put it on there--
- Oh, did I get a bingo!
-  Good job!
(excited chatter)
-  Ya mon', welcome to--

- Whose the chef from the
Muppets? "Herdy slerdy ferdy!"
- Chef? I don't know.

- Get outta here. You lose.
- Oh, Swedish.
(laughing)
-  I like guns,
and I'm from Alaska,
and I ran for Vice-President!
- Sarah Palin
- Yeah.
- Again? Seriously, Joel
just had the worst fart.
Get out.
(laughing)
There you have it, 22 degrees,
22 degrees outside.
And what do we say
almost 90 degrees inside?
There's quite the difference.
We're gonna keep the fire rollin'.
We've got sleeping bags,
it's gonna be a good night.
So we're gonna end the night!
Thank you so much for watching.
Ellie, handing it back over to you.
-  Alright.
Everyone that got bingo,
come and pick one little prize before bed.
- I'm picking this!
-  Okay, except that.
(laughing)
