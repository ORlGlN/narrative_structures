- We're delivering cookies.
- Yeah!
- Lucas.
No.
- Cayden.
No.
- Mason.
No.
- Jeffrey.
No.
(Jared gasps)
- Mm! Best cookie I've ever had!
(pop music)
(intro music)
-  Did something
sneaky just happen?
- Calvin was sitting right next to you.
He came around over here
and I was like, 'okay, yeah,
just sit over here.'
And he reached into my pocket
and grabbed this car for
Jackson without me knowing.
And we had these taken
away because you guys were
being a little too rowdy at the table.
-  That was sneaky sneaky.
- It was sneaky and now he's going back.
He knew exactly what he wanted to do.
-  Did he sneak you the car?
- Yeah.
-  Did you tell him to do that?
- Yeah.
-  What?
We are doing things a little
differently today, everybody.
We went out to breakfast
this morning as a family
which was really fun. I love
the week before Christmas
going out to breakfast,
we always go to Herms,
but we are doing things different
because we are making
a really fancy lunch,
and we're all going to sit
down and have a nice lunch
because tonight, later tonight,
Jared's going to be busy
right now, and he's going to take Jackson,
they're going to pass out
some stuff for the neighbors
this afternoon and then tonight
we're going to do cookies.
So we're all going to make
family cookies, decorate cookies,
have leftovers from lunch, eat that.
But I just wanted to
have a nice meal today
and I thought 'Well, let's do
it for lunch and then tonight
we'll make cookies.'
Baked potatoes are in the oven,
I'm making pumpkin cornbread
You guys have to try this. It is so good.
I'm going to tell you
the recipe right now.
I'm just going to show you this
so if you want to take a
picture, take a picture.
That's for the honey butter on the side.
But this is all that goes in
just the pumpkin cornbread.
You literally put it all together,
you mix it up, you put
it in the oven at 375,
wait til it's done, about
20 minutes, pull it out.
It's so good with baked
potatoes, a side of vegetables,
some ham, some rolls, really good.
-  My boys are
making me some honey butter.
Calvin, how's your lip?
Is it good?
- No. Ow.
- Yeah, it's an owie.
It's much better today.
It looks worse because
there's that big bandaid.
There's a little butterfly
bandaid underneath that's holding
his lip together and it
looks really good and healed.
We probably didn't have to
have it today but I wanted to
just in case.
-  I'm going to push
to stop. Is this to stop?
-  Yes.
(mixer stops)
-  Good job.
-  Ellis, this
all looks so fantastic.
You have outdone yourself yet again.
Look at this!
We got ham, we got bread, we
got potatoes, we got cheese
sour cream!
- I was really so excited for the broccoli
and I forgot to cook it.
-  Oh, no.
- But I'm too hungry now,
I'm like, 'It can wait.'
- You know what, I'm actually
glad you forgot the broccoli.
- Oh, poo.
- It's not that I don't like
broccoli. I like broccoli.
Especially killer broccoli.
I'm glad you forgot the broccoli because,
let's be honest --
- You sound like a radio.
- Your farts are a little stinky as it is.
I don't think broccoli is
going to help at all with that.
- Come on, let's sit down
guys. Mom wants us to sit down.
- We're talking about stuff
at lunch with the kids
that has to do with
your bad example.
- Potty talk.
What about being
grateful, you little turd?
- Okay. I guess we're going
to have that discussion now.
- Which one's mine?
This one's mine because
I put sour cream on it.
You eat the sour cream one.
-  No.
Be grateful.
- ...Mother and Father. Thank
you for this day. What now?
- Thank you for our blessings.
- Thank you for our blessings. Amen.
- Amen.
- We are talking a lot
about being grateful
and that we are grateful for
what we get no matter what.
And we talked a lot at lunch.
You want some more ham?
- No, it's gone.
-  More ham.
Right there, you want
more ham right there?
I think it's so funny that
Calvin has not only eaten his ham
he's eaten Jackson's ham and
now he's asking for more.
And he has always been such a good eater.
He's never been picky.
And Jackson wasn't the best eater,
but I don't know what to compare it to.
I just know that we had
a hard time sometimes
getting him to eat, but I told
him how proud I was of him.
Lately, he's been just
eating what we give him.
We were at Bonnie's and
Bonnie got lasagna out
and I saw him looking at it for a minute
and then he just ate it and
I was like, 'that was good!'
- That is, if Calvin doesn't eat it first.
-  Yeah, because he's
crazy and eats everyone's food.
- Boys, when we get a gift from someone,
no matter how big, how small --
-  Or if it's one or a lot,
- What do we say?
- Thank you?
- That's right.
- Parenting is so interesting.
Nobody has it the perfect way
nobody knows exactly how you should do it,
it's just kind of based on your own kids.
But I do remember one
thing that I really liked,
is my parents would always
talk about scenarios with us.
Even when I was younger,
they would talk about
marriage scenarios, and
'what if', like money,
like, 'what if you lose
your job, what do you do?'
They just always talked about
scenarios and I don't know why
maybe their parents did that,
but I do think that's
one of the biggest things
that my parents did that did
help me, and that I remember
and that I have tried
to do in our parenting.
And our kids are young.
He's almost four and he's two and a half.
They're so young but I
do feel like it helps.
Four-year-olds sometimes can
be like, 'What, just what?'
It's like, 'no, we be grateful'.
We're just trying our
hardest with parenting
and I feel like so far, I'm
okay with how things are going.
- And think of it this
way: You remember that
one of the most things
about what your parents did.
If you keep that up,
that's going to be
something they remember.
Like role-playing situations
like that, and just asking,
'what would you do', and
then talking about that.
That's a great idea.
-  What was one
thing your parents did
that you loved?
- My mom and dad would
always just talk to me about
gratitude and having a positive attitude.
I mean, that's one thing my
dad always said is 'A.I.E.,
Attitude Is Everything.'
So I would just try and remember that.
-  And bubbles.
- Blowing bubbles and
having a positive attitude
about things, which is
always make me think better
of situations and that would
develop into things like
gratitude and happiness and
joy and that sort of thing.
-  I like that.
- All done!
- Good job.
- Grant?
No.
-  I like the name Grant.
Jackson, Calvin and Grant.
- No, that's a girl name.
-  Jackson, Calvin, Grant.
- Any name that Jackson
doesn't like is a girl name.
- Malcolm?
No.
- In the Middle?
No.
- Lucas.
No.
- Cayden.
No.
- Mason.
No.
- Jeffrey.
No.
- Marcus.
No.
- Junior.
No.
- Declan.
No.
- Jesus.
No.
- Cyrus.
No.
- Tian.
No.
- Cody.
- Yeah!
- You like Cody?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
-  I think it's fun that Jackson's
been really involved.
- Pizza.
- No. That's food!
- You're right.
-  This morning we were in the car
and Jared left the car and Jackson goes,
'Mom, can't we just name him Mason?'
- Do you like the name Mason?
- No. I love Cody.
- You like Cody?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, it's official.
Our baby's name is Cody.
-  No it's not.
I'm making sugar cookies.
- And I am emailing the four winners--
I'm getting emotional, the four winners --
-  Don't hit
yourself. That's not nice.
(imitates gorilla)
Be a man!
(mock punch)
- I'm emailing the winners
of the IVF Grant contest
and I'm being sneaky, and
I'm emailing them and saying
that I want some more
information before we go further
and then we're going to surprise them
on a phone call or a video chat.
So I'm hoping this works out.
This is kind of what we did last year.
So hopefully they're not
too suspicious about things
and it's a complete surprise.
-  Who is ready to make cookies?
-  Me.
-  Calvin, you ready?
-  Yeah!
- Yes! Okay, so it was like we had lunch
and then it's dinnertime.
I took a nap, a really long nap.
I put a show on and I said,
'Kids, Mommy's going to rest
until we watch a movie. And
they both laid by my side
one on one arm while I
rested and it was beautiful.
And I am so so appreciative.
- Where are the cookies?
-  We got to make them.
So I'm going to lay it right here,
we're going to roll them out
and you can put the cookies, cut them out.
And a lot of them are
going to look like this.
I did a few just because I
wanted a few really nice ones.
-  I want to roll it.
-  Do you want to roll it? Okay.
You're already starting
the choo-choo train?
- Yeah.
(acoustic music)
-  Doesn't that look good?
(acoustic music)
-  What one did you get?
Gingerbread man?
Look how good those look, Cal.
Okay, do a choo-choo train, Jacks.
So push it really hard all the way
and you can make a choo-choo
train. Is that cool?
- A choo-choo train?
-  Yeah.
- I wanna eat it.
-  We gotta cook it first.
- Okay, boys, what are we doing?
- We're delivering cookies.
- Yeah, we've got our favorite cookies,
our favorite snacks, swig
cookies, and we're delivering them
to all the neighbors in the house.
All the neighbors in the neighborhood.
Yeah, that's where they
live, is our neighborhood.
So we've got a box of cookies
and the boys are taking them door to door.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah. And what do we say
when we knock on the door?
- Merry Christmas!
-  Merry Christmas!
Did you boys both just fall?
- Yeah.
-  It's so slippery.
It's so slippery. Woo!
Woo! It is so slippery.
Careful! Whoa!
(Jared laughs)
- I'm skating!
-  Yeah, it's like ice skating.
- Look at me.
-  Yeah, look at you.
Okay, you ready Calvin? Here ya go.
Let's go to the next house.
Yeah, that one. Let's go.
What do you see?
- Cookies?
-  Cookies!
Wait, let's take our coats, our shoes off,
and we'll wash our hands.
Whew! Boy, Ellie, I will tell you
my hip is burning, burning, burning.
So we went around the whole
neighborhood and we delivered
those swig cookies
boxes but not only that,
I did some Secret Santa stuff
that I can't tell you about
but I was racing because I did
some like ding-dong ditching
with gifts and stuff.
So anyway, but my hips are
burning so decorating cookies
sounds like the perfect
way to rest my little hip
and to get a little salivation going.
- Sugar cookies can either
be really gross or good.
Honestly, if you overcook
them, they're gross.
I think these are good.
-  Perfect.
Oh, we can't do it yet,
we've got to wash our hands
and then you've got to
decorate them first.
Are you ready to decorate?
- Yeah!
-  Are you ready to decorate?
- Yeah.
(cookie falls)
(Jared laughs)
-  Poor cookie.
Are you ready to decorate?
- Yeah!
- Let's decorate some cookies!
- Jackson, good job, you're
already starting, mister.
-  Look at that. Not
wasting any time at all.
I think this calls for a cookie montage.
(jazz music)
-  Yeah, it's cute.
I think you get a gold star!
- I'm putting these on top,
we'll make it look like --
-  Yeah. Ellie,
that's stinking cute.
- The black color has orange flavoring.
-  Ooh, yum.
Delicious to the taste?
(jazz music)
- No! This is crazy!
I just built this perfect snowman
with the icing and everything
and I was like, 'Ellie, do
you want to see my snowman?'
And as I was doing that, the bag
caught the edge of the snowman.
-  It looks really --
-  It's like --
(Jared gasps)
Mm! Best cookie I've ever had.
(mumbles)
- What did you just do?
What did you just do? Oh, my gosh.
Look at your belly!
That's cute, Ellie.
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this.
I'll get to that point real quick.
So tomorrow we're having
a family Christmas party
and part of that family Christmas
party is a lip-sync battle
and we came up with a song.
Well, actually we didn't come up with it,
I asked my sister Melanie, 'We
need a song to lip sync to.
What should we do?'
And the first thing that my
sister said, of course, was
- 'Beyonce'!
(sings "Single Ladies")
- "Single Ladies."
So Ellie and I are making
up our own dance right now
the day before this lip sync battle
and we're practicing the dance.
- We weren't going to do
it. I was gonna be like,
because we haven't literally
had a second to do it.
And Jared's like, 'Let's
just practice and we'll see.'
And it's taken an hour and we
pretty much have something.
So I'm excited.
- And we're going to attempt
to show you right now.
But no laughing. Promise?
- It's going to be cute
and part of the family.
- Okay, here we go.
Oh my gosh. I can't
believe I'm doing this.
-  It's cute.
- I don't know about copyright stuff
but we're just going to throw it in there.
- Yeah.
- If I have to put music
over it, I put music over it.
Just imagine "All the Single Ladies."
- You guys will get it.
♪ Single Ladies ♪
(generic dance music)
♪ Single Ladies ♪
- That was it.
- That was it. We just made
that up. What do you think?
- We literally just made that dance up.
You can tell we don't know all the words
but we're getting there.
It's going to be cute.
- I'm sweaty already.
- I think it's cute, I don't
know what it will look like.
- I feel bad for everyone
who just watched me do that.
Sorry, guys.
- It's fun. It's a fun
family Christmas thing
that is so not my family but
Landon had the wonderful idea
to do it so we're gonna do it.
- Are you kidding me?
This is going to be the
best night ever tomorrow.
- Can't wait. So fun.
We just got done calling the
IVF winners and telling them.
- Although, we have one more
phone call to do tomorrow.
- It's been a very emotional night.
It's been emotional, I mean
learning Beyonce is emotional.
It was emotional because not
only did we tell a handful
of people that they won a grant but
there's a lot of people that didn't.
And there was a lot of
people that applied for this
last year that applied
for it again this year,
then we had a lot of friends
apply for it this year.
- Yeah.
- That's really hard.
We had some extended
family, a lot of you guys.
It's been a crazy Christmas
week for everybody involved.
So, thank you everybody for participating.
- Thank you for your
support, your patience
and we're grateful for you.
- We are. This is the
biggest thing for us.
To look back on, to tell
our kids that the one thing
that came from us doing this is us
being able to give back
like this is priceless.
- Absolutely.
- And I'm very grateful and
I hope our kids can know that
and see that in the future.
Guys, let's rock this Beyonce dance.
- We got it.
- I'm sweating really bad.
Thank you guys. We hope you
guys have an awesome week.
- Have a great weekend.
Merry Christmas and we'll
see you guys tomorrow.
- Tomorrow at the Griffith's
family Christmas party.
- Get ready because it's gonna be crazy!
- Who's going to win the lip sync?
I can picture Landon and Julia
doing a pretty dang good job.
- I think so too.
They're always fun like that.
- But my bet's on us.
- We gotta learn these words better.
- Let me know, is it
possible to beat Beyonce?
♪ Whoa oh oh oh oh oh ♪
♪ Shake those hips girl ♪
- Oh, that's the other thing.
So my hips are hurting twice today.
- I know.
- Because of running
the Secret Santa stuff
and dancing to Beyonce.
She's like Shakira. Her hips don't lie.
Okay? See ya.
