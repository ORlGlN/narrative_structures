- Guys, today is amazing.
- I'm not sure we're speaking.
- Oh geez.
You can't use that forever.
- Fine, you're good.
- Yes I can.
- No.
- Say ah.
- Ah.
(Jared laughs)
- Did it work?
Do you like it?
Penny girl, hello hello.
- New rocks.
-  New rocks?
What are you and Calvin doin'?
- We're just throwing rocks over there.
-  Well we're finding
some pretty cool ones,
look at these.
- Well I send them out to play
and of course, the best thing to play with
Is that your rock?
- I'm finding one for you.
-  Is to find rocks.
- Look at this one, this
one's a magical rock, watch.
You just grab right here
and it'll disappear,
but then magically come
right out of your ear.
-  Hey Mr. Jackson, do you want
to tell Daddy about school?
- I did my letters.
- You passed 'em all?
- Yeah.
- He's on level three.
- Good job.
- Hey, we'll practice your
level three one's tonight.
-  I can't tell who's
poopy, Penny or Calvin.
- No.
(Ellie laughs)
- When I was in college
I used to donate blood
quite a bit, and I wanted to
get back into doing that thing.
I have O negative blood,
I'm a universal donor.
And then the Las Vegas attacks happened,
and just really, Ellie
and I have been talking,
I should go donate blood,
I should go donate blood.
Our church is actually
doing a big blood drive now,
so I am on my way to the church
and I am going to go donate blood.
As much as I would like to admit
when I did this in college,
I was doing it out of
the goodness of my heart,
and it was, but a lot of was
also because you would get
a free t-shirt after donating blood.
Don't tell me you've
never done that before.
I think in college I was the king
of getting free stuff.
Free food, free shirts,
anytime there was something
that you could get out of it
for not doing anything,
I would do that thing.
We had so many free shirts, Ellie
(laughs)
Ellie would get mad at me
if I came home with another one.
She's like your closet is full
of free shirts and they don't fit anymore.
I'm tossing them all.
I love free stuff, who doesn't?
Fancy seeing you here.
- I know.
I didn't know you signed up to do this?
- Yeah.
I'm O negative, I'm a universal donor.
I should always be donating.
- I can't remember, I
thought I was O positive,
but I think I'm B positive,
but I can't remember.
-  Are you positive about that.
- No.
(laughing)
- So here's the question
of the day for you.
Have you ever fainted while giving blood?
- No I haven't, but I've been turned down,
because I haven't weighed enough.
Oh
Funny that.
- I have never fainted
- I've never fainted giving blood,
but I'm always nervous
that it's gonna happen.
I've definitely had close times,
where I'm like okay, I'm gettin' woozy,
- Yeah
- but I've never fainted.
So he who does not faint, wins.
- That's right.
(bright jazzy music)
- How ya doing Mom?
Good?
(Jared laughs)
Dang, that is a lot of blood
and that came from my body.
-  That came from your body.
-  No one else's.
-  Nobody else's.
- Just my body?
-  Yeah.
- My time was 8:43,
so I don't know if that's good or not,
no one else has asked for the time.
-  Yeah, that's not great.
- It's not great?
-  No.
- People have gone faster than I have?
-  Oh yeah.
- I wasn't pumping that hard.
- Yeah, anything under five
minutes is considered bad.
- Oh I was way off.
Now this is the best part
about donating blood.
Snack table.
Apple juice and pretzels,
don't mind if I do.
How'd you do Mom?
- Good.
- Good?
Are you feeling dizzy?
- No not now, I was a little bit.
-  Oh.
- I like how they give us
the red cross on our arms.
- On your arm, yeah.
Okay, I think we're good to go.
(Mom laughs)
Just kidding.
That's probably not funny to do here.
- Not here.
-  I can't even keep up with you.
I can't
(laughing)
Hey, let's put your helmet on silly.
You are so fast.
Oh my goodness, you're
not just walking anymore,
you're running.
- Bell.
-  Yeah, ring it.
(bell dings)
Yeah!
I have an announcement that
I need everyone's attention.
Yes Brian, I want attention right now.
(blaster firing)
You still like your blaster?
(laughs)
You still like it?
I want to let you know
something here real quick.
- Dad, Mommy.
- Oh.
- Oh you make a difference.
- Dad, Mommy.
- I made a difference today.
- Good job Jar, I'm proud of you.
-  Thanks
Do you know what I did today Jackson?
I donated blood from my arm.
They put a needle inside my arm
and they took the blood out for people
who don't have as much blood and need it,
so we can save some peoples lives
- Oh.
- Hopefully.
-  Is that cool?
Is it nice to help people?
Yeah.
Who are you gonna help today?
- Spidey.
-  Are you gonna help Spiderman?
- I want to be Spiderman and help someone.
-  Oh that's such a great idea.
That's so awesome.
Well let's put on your Spiderman costume.
You haven't worn it in at least 12 hours.
You need to put it on
and save someone, okay?
- I don't want to put it on right now.
- You're right, you're right,
because not all superheroes wear capes.
My son is so mature.
- You are silly.
- Seriously though,
seriously, how cute of Jackson
to say that, right?
- Guys, today is amazing.
Do you remember our video with Andy,
where they have not been able
to find anybody with what he has.
Well?
- It sounds like from
Heidi texting me today
that they found a
perfect match in England,
in England.
This is the power of the internet.
- I'm so so grateful.
- Yeah, how incredible is that.
So they've been talking,
and hopefully, this means good news,
sharing information from doctors
and ultimately the goal
here is to find out
one, what's wrong with the brain
not telling the heart and the lungs to go
and then finding any causation to SIDS.
And hopefully we can prevent some things
like that from happening again.
- Isn't that amazing?
- That is so amazing.
- We are so happy for them.
That was the whole point of why
we and they wanted to make the video
is just to get it out there
and ask, does anyone
know anything about this.
So we're grateful for that,
and Jared and I, we have
stayed in close contact,
and I hate to say IVF grant winners,
because it's more than that,
it's like they're our friends.
- They are our friends.
- We have stayed in really close contact,
sorry my arm's tired.
(laughs) Hard vlog.
- You gotta get your knee up there.
You gotta work out your
vlogging arm Ellie,
you've gotta vlog a little more.
- I know.
We've been staying in
contact with all of them,
we have our little group that we talk to,
we've all cried together,
we've all talked together,
laughed together.
- We share updates with each other,
every time something goes on,
we have this group message that we do.
- They've been really good to us
and we're so excited for Joan and John,
they are indeed expecting.
- Yes!
- We are so happy for them.
- Oh!
- Aaron and Riley, they
just had their baby shower.
We met her brother the other day.
That was random, that was so fun.
- They're getting ready
to have their baby.
- Megan and Tyler, they're
so close to Aaron and Riley
in terms of pregnancy, their babies
are gonna be due or are gonna be born
within a week or two of each other.
So this is just an exciting time
and I just feel so grateful to have
even a small part in all of this.
- The word of mouth you reach
is amazing
- Yeah.
- and that's been a blessing.
There are four other of our friends
that are going through and getting ready
to go through the IVF process,
so we are so grateful for them
and we are so hopeful for them
and we just wanted to
update you guys as well.
- Just upload that.
That was good, that was
smooth, no edits there.
- Well sometimes when we
sit down to really talk,
especially about something
important, it's like
- And something serious.
- It's like one of the kids end up crying,
Penny needs to go potty
or wants to come in,
and it can be hectic,
but I was like, that went rather smooth.
- I think the only hiccup there
was your vlog arm.
- I know.
- You need to work out
your vlog arm a little bit.
- I know.
(laughing)
- Well I got got blood taken today too,
- Yes you did.
- it just wasn't for what you did.
See that bruise there.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was good, smooth.
- You'll get to my level
- High five.
- of blood donating soon.
- You've got perfect blood.
- I should do this more.
I used to do it a lot.
- My dad always did it a lot.
- Yeah, so, donate your blood.
So it is officially official.
I have changed my phone to the Pixel 2 XL,
and I know a lot of people
are probably thinking,
Jared what are you doing,
you know the display
issues are going crazy.
Well I'm not doing it for the sole purpose
of the Pixel 2, I'm doing it more
of an iPhone vs Android situation.
So I'm not taking the display
into that much consideration when I do it.
But I do have to be very
very careful about it,
because I am essentially
being shunned away
from family and friends.
Dad, what did you say to me
when I showed you my phone?
- I'm not sure we're speaking.
- Oh geez, it's like you're not a part
of our family anymore.
Brian stopped texting me,
because I'm a green bubble.
So I'm sorry,
I'm doing this out of
the goodness of my heart
to give to you, so you have the knowledge,
if you're ever interested in that.
- Now you're iPhone's gone to pot.
- It has, it really has.
Ellie sends me text messages all the time
and they never show up on my phone
as like a notification,
and do not disturb is not on.
So, experimentation.
But at any rate, we've
got a XL Hello Fresh
cooking right now.
So we've got Mom and Dad over here,
we're gonna have dinner with them
as a happy family, despite the shunning.
(laughing)
Grab Ultra.
- Do you want to feed him?
Does he want to eat?
He does?
Here can you ahh for him?
- Ah.
- Come here, hold him
so he can take a bite.
Say ahh.
- Ahh.
(Jared laughing)
- Did it work?
You like it?
Can you say ahh for him?
Here I'll feed him, say ahh.
(growls)
Calvin, say ahh.
- Ahh.
(laughing)
- We've been trying to trick him.
Calvin has been bringing toys up to us
and like ah, feed, you
know, he wants food.
And so Ellie would pretend to feed him
and then go to feed Calvin
and he would never do it,
So we're trying to trick him.
Just one bite, that's all you need
to know you like it, right?
We'll doing it one of these days.
- I failed today, but it's okay.
(laughing)
- Hey.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- It is the kids best time.
And Jared has been up way late this week.
I mean doing one daily
vlog and then doing another
so that you're on track,
has been a little crazy.
- It's been fine.
- It's been fun.
- But it's more work than I thought.
- Jared has been editing a lot
in preparation for Jared and I,
for next week, we'll be gone
for eight days, we are
going out of the country.
- Out of the country.
- And we have some business
that we are doing.
And we are going to put these kids to bed
and then we're gonna put ourselves to bed.
- 'Cause I am pooped literally.
(laughing)
Like I am so tired,
throw me a squatty potty,
because I am pooped.
I'll see myself out.
- Did you see they came out
with a kids squatty potty?
- Yes I saw that.
And I was like, we
should totally get that.
-  Tots.
I think I'm gonna look at
these kids play a little longer
and then we'll put 'em to bed.
Psssh, droid, Android.
Is that an Android?
It's an Android, right?
- You have to be my support.
-  It's an Android, right?
- Jackson, will you love me
if I switch to an Android?
- No.
- What?
My entire family is disowning me,
because of this phone switch.
- Well Brian is, he texted me,
'cause your texts aren't working.
- Oh well, what can you do?
-  Not do Android.
- I'm doing this for the people.
-  Get off your butt.
- Kids come to me and I'll put you to bed.
- Get off your bottom and say,
okay, let's put jammies
on, we both were like.
Don't you ever have those days?
I feel like it just has
hit, like I can't get up.
- But it's like, it wasn't even like
-  A crazy day.
- It was just like a normal
day, but I'm just like woo.
-  Well you did donate blood today.
- You know what, you're right,
you should put the kids to bed.
I donated blood today.
I did my part.
-  I think I lost a lot
of blood giving birth to 'em.
I think that trumps all.
(laughing)
- You can't use that forever.
- Fine, you're good.
- Yes I can.
- No.
- (slow motion) Yes I can.
I can use that forever.
- Can you?
Okay let me know in the
comments down below,
is Ellie allowed to use that
card for the rest of her life.
- Heavens no, I don't
care what anyone says,
I can use child birth forever.
- Why is it that whenever I see you
in that outfit, I just get really hungry?
- 'Cause I like to wear donuts.
- What does it say on the back of it?
It's like wake up for what?
Do do do do, do do do do.
- What?
- Anyway guys, it is time for bed.
- What was that?
- It's the turn down for what?
- Oh.
- That's what they're referencing there.
Donut for what?
- Here catch this.
- That was terrible try me again.
- Our game is off.
One more time.
- Your throws are off.
- That was a bad one,
- one more time
Your nose is hittin' 'em.
- I'm just gonna stay in one spot.
Yeah!
Okay, we're gonna go to bed and clean up
this popcorn mess, watch a show
and then I'm zoned.
I'm zonked Ellie.
We'll see ya next time.
Thanks for watching guys,
have a wonderful evening.
Bye
