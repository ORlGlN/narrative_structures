- We have a special delivery.
-  Oh, my gosh!
- And it's not Costa Vida salad.
- Are you ready?
Oh, my gosh, this is so exciting.
I can't believe we're finally getting 'em.
- My mom's gonna watch
this and roll her eyes
'cause she's like, "I was sick first."
-  Hey, do you wanna
read it to Penny again?
Okay.
(Calvin mumbles)
-  Sing to it.
♪ La la la la ♪
-  Mommy, mommy.
- We are singing Christmas music.
What's up?
Oh, my gosh. (laughs)
Yes, you just witnessed that.
He goes, "Mama," and came and hugged me.
Jackson, can you help me?
Come here.
I just got back from the salon, guys.
My friend just touched up my roots,
and she trimmed my hair a little bit.
So I feel very fresh.
I came home and we had
sprinkles galore over here
with gingerbread houses.
So I cleaned up, but I have two friends,
so Jared and I wanted to
do neighborhood gifts,
but I have two special friends in the area
that have been so unbelievably good to me.
Remember that flower over there
that I've showed you
guys a bajillion times?
She gave this to me in
May, and I still like,
everyday, I look at it, everyday.
And I just think what a thoughtful gift.
My friend gave me that,
and then my other friend,
I work with her at church
with the activity days girls.
And I swear, she came into my life
during a really hard time.
It was like after my first miscarriage.
And like with all the church stuff,
I like didn't do anything.
I put it all on her, and I was like,
"I'm not functioning right now.
"I'm not gonna go.
"I'm not gonna do this right now.
"I want to, but I just don't
have the energy right now."
And I put a lot of work on
her, and she was so good to me
and totally lifted me up when I needed it.
And so when I was at the
salon, they had a bunch
of bath bombs, so I got
each of them a bath bomb.
And I got them a little mini
shampoo and conditioner.
This is Bumble and bumble.
It's really good stuff that I like.
So I thought giving
them just a little extra
special gift to tell them how much
I appreciate their
friendship would be fun.
And so,
Jackson, sorry, I asked
you to come over here
and then I ignored you.
Come here.
Do you guys wanna help
me put them in the bags?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, you can open up these.
-  They're bath bombs?
-  Yeah.
-  I want to put this one in.
-  Okay, you can open
these bags and put them in it.
Calvin, do you wanna open one.
-  Mm-hmm.
- Okay, open that up.
So I got them some bath bombs.
And my mom and dad have seriously been hit
with a really bad cold right now.
And they had, oh, they smell so good.
They're called Breathe bath bombs.
So I guess there's this lady in my town
that makes all these bath bombs,
and you guys all know, I
mean any bath bomb, I love.
So I'm excited to try these.
Perfect.
Put your hand in there
and stretch that out.
Yup, a little, push it, push it.
Yup, perfect.
Put the bath bomb in there.
And then, let's see, the
gentle shampoo conditioner,
put this one together and put it in here.
And then Calvin, can
you put those in there?
So my parents have been sick,
so I got them some of
those Breathe bath bombs.
And I think tomorrow, I'm gonna
go down and give it to 'em
because my dad has been super sick.
My mom's gonna watch
this and roll her eyes
because she's like, "I was sick first."
My mom has been really sick,
and then my dad caught it.
And now it's like the world
has ended in their home
because dad has a man cold
that's really, really bad.
But I'm gonna go give them
some of those tomorrow.
Can you guys help me
deliver these to my friends?
-  Mm-hmm.
-  Okay, I'm gonna
write them a little note
and then you can ring their
doorbell and give it to them.
Sound good?
- Yeah.
-  Are you guys ready?
Ready to rumble?
Okay.
Daddy, are you ready?
Ready to rumble?
-  Ready to rumble?
-  What's up?
Why are you contemplating
while you're looking out your window?
- I'm looking out the
window because our books,
our first batch of books
are being delivered today.
So I kind of feel like I'm just like--
(Ellie laughs)
-  The Penny book!
- Yeah, they're gonna be here today.
I'm so excited.
- Yay!
Jared's children's book is gonna be here.
I'm really excited, Ellie.
I'm really excited.
Whoa!
-  I hope everyone loves it.
- Yeah.
And if it gets here today,
maybe we'll give you like a
sneak peek of the whole thing.
-  Totally!
- I'm mostly excited,
this is a project that my
dad and I worked on together.
I'm mostly excited to have him hold it.
And that's the thing.
It's like when you create something,
everything we do, almost
everything we do is digital,
with the exception of like this stuff.
And having something physical
that I can hold on to
and say like, "We made
this," like that's special.
-  So fun.
- And that's cool.
And so I'm like so excited.
The UPS guy usually gets here
around three, and it's like
not even close to that.
- Tick tock.
I forgot to tell you guys.
Guess what.
My friend that does my hair,
she gave you guys a Christmas gift.
She knew how much you
guys liked bath bombs.
She gave you each your very own.
Don't put it in that one
because we're gonna give that
to our friend, but
we'll keep this at home.
You can put it back, and tonight,
when we take a bath, you can use that.
-  These?
-  Yeah.
- These blue bath bombs?
- Yeah.
Seriously, the kids love bath bombs.
If I have ones, I have to hide 'em
because they're like, "But
I see it and I want it."
So that was cute of her, so nice of her.
The other day, when we went to that play
and a lot of the vloggers
were there, Carly was there.
And I was talking to her about
like the holidays and stuff.
And she just Instagrammed that
she has split up the weekends
in December to be with
both sides of the family.
And that way, on Christmas Day,
it's just her and her family.
And I had seen a comment
on there that someone said,
"How do you make this decision?
"I get so many people
that are upset with me."
And Jared and I have
made that decision too.
When we very first got married,
we were waiting for the
first family (mumbles)
and they just pulled up.
Jared and I did that years ago.
Our very first Christmas, we
spent it with Jared's family.
The second Christmas we were married,
we spent it with my family.
And then ever since
then, on Christmas Day,
we've spent it just with us two.
And now that we have our
kids, it's us and the kids.
And I really like it
because it leaves, I think,
I feel awkward right now.
- Oh, don't feel awkward.
It's okay.
It's nice because like we were able
to like have those family things.
And we still have family things.
We just don't do it on Christmas Day.
-  Yeah.
- Like we have a family
party with your family
a couple of days before
Christmas, and we do things
with my family a couple of
days before Christmas too.
So Christmas Day is our family.
-  It really is fun to be home.
- Over there, over there,
over there. (mumbles)
Stack it next here.
Just stack them.
- We have a special delivery.
-  Oh, my gosh.
- And it's not Costa Vida salad.
- It's our box.
We got the boxes with
our books inside of them.
I'm so excited.
I need a knife, stat.
-  Okay, I'm watching, mister.
- Do you wanna open the box?
- No, you open the box.
- I'll open this one,
and you open this one.
- Okay, that's fair.
-  It's like Christmas for you.
- Are you ready?
Oh, my gosh, this is so exciting.
I can't believe we're finally getting 'em.
This is so cool.
-  What?
-  Look at this.
-  This is your very own book!
- Pretty Penny and Her Very Best Friend.
-  That is so cute.
And look how pretty Miss Pretty Penny is.
That's your book.
-  Calvin, look.
Do you like it?
Yeah?
Do you like it too, Nixon?
-  Hi.
Hi, Jen.
- Hi.
-  Jen's in town.
We're all gonna go to a movie.
Jared, this is cool.
Written by Jared Mecham
and J. Craig Mecham.
How cute.
- Penny was a pretty puppy.
She lived happily with her
very best friend, Henry,
in a place where the neighbors
would always call her Pretty Penny.
How awesome is this?
I wanted to take a second
and talk a little bit more
about our book that we just got.
I'm so excited about that,
but you already know that.
We want to make this available to you
as soon as we possibly can.
And we actually have the
ability to do it now,
but there's more to it than that.
My dad and I have worked
really hard on this book,
and we wanna make it available
to as many people as we possibly can.
The way that we've gone through it
is a little bit more expensive
than we want it to be.
And so Ellie and I and my dad are looking
at different options in
terms of manufacturing
and development and printing
and shipping this book
so it's more affordable for you.
And so while we could make
it available right now,
I think we're gonna postpone
it just a little bit.
And we're working as fast as
we can to make it available
as fast as possible, but
I think in the long run,
it's gonna be better for you
and for us to do it this way.
And it may take some
time, but we're looking
at all the different
venues because I think
we're just a little surprised by the cost
that this distributor is
wanting to charge for it.
So with that being said,
we have a few copies and everything.
This ultimately gives us
the opportunity for us
to do signed copies instead
of having it shipped
from somewhere that we don't know.
We know exactly where it's shipping from.
We can get some and sign it
and then have it shipped out is the plan.
We want to do some signed
copies for some of you guys.
So stay tuned for that.
In fact, what I'm probably
gonna do, here soon,
I'm gonna have a survey come
out to you where we ask you
questions about all of
these different things
about books, about signing,
about things that you
would like and so forth.
So I just wanted to be
candid and honest with you.
And I feel like this is
gonna be better for us,
and especially for you, lowering the cost,
making this available for everyone.
So thanks for your
patience and understanding.
This will be available soon for you.
We wanted to make it
available for Christmas,
but it just didn't work out.
But it's gonna be coming
soon, and it's gonna be great.
You know when you taste something
for the very first time,
or you haven't had
anything sour in a while
and you eat something sour
and you're like (mumbles)
it gets you, I think
Penny had that experience
for the very first time.
Ellie has her bath set
up, and Penny was in here,
is in here, and she saw this bath bomb.
And she tooK a little lick of it,
and these are all like natural
and they're okay to eat.
Oh!
And Penny licked it, and
she literally was like.
It was so funny.
And you just saw my tongue way too much,
so sorry about that.
I just had to be descriptive with it.
-  It was the
funniest thing though.
- It was so funnY.
-  It's not yours.
No, don't even, don't.
- Don't even.
-  No, ah-ah.
- Okay.
You have to take my word for it.
It was so funny.
She's like, "That was interesting.
"I wanna try it again."
-  I think she would hate it.
(Jared laughs)
- Don't fall in the tub.
Okay, it's time for you to eat dinner.
Let's go eat dinner.
-  He's showing her the book.
Don't be embarrassed.
Are you showing Penny the book?
Show her the book.
Oh, my gosh.
That's the cutest thing.
So it's late.
Jared and I are going over our videos.
- That is the cutest thing I have ever--
-  But he is showing her the book.
- Poor Calvin.
-  Calvin has an
ear infection for sure.
- Yeah, he's been like
having a hard time sleeping.
He came and sat down
with us and everything.
- And he has just been crying
and pulling and grabbing his ear.
- So he sat on the couch with us,
and he has been watching Peppa Pig.
And I have our Penny book
that was delivered today right here.
And he looked at it and
grabbed it, looked at the book,
and then just walked right over to Penny.
-  And he literally,
he has been crying.
Like he's been watching his
show, but he's been just crying.
Penny's in bed for the night.
He's opening the pages.
-  Here's a bedtime story, Penny.
Oh. (laughs)
-  Oh, he's embarrassed.
-  Did you read Penny the book?
-  Did she like it?
Okay.
-  Do you like it?
Do you like the Penny book?
Good.
Do you wanna look at the pictures?
Come on, let's look at the pictures.
Do you wanna read it to Penny again?
Okay.
-  How adorable.
- He knows that's Penny on the book,
and he's reading it to Penny.
-  That was really cute.
I think what's cute is
that his ear hurts so bad
and he's being tender.
- He's been really sweet
even though he's in pain.
It was so cute.
Because we were talking to Calvin like,
"Does your ear hurt?"
And he said, "Yeah."
And Ellie said, "We'll go see
the doctor tomorrow morning,
"and we'll make sure that
he makes it all better."
And then he goes, "Okay, mom."
And I was just like.
Like so sweet.
-  Yes.
I didn't even see it coming.
He's had a little stuffy
nose but I didn't--
- Poor guy.
So it has been four hours
since we put Calvin to bed,
and he is finally asleep.
(chuckles) Do you hear that snoring?
Of course, you do.
Sounds like a bear.
- I gotta go lay him in bed.
He has been pulling at his
ear all night going, "Owie."
- Yeah, we'll get him all taken care of.
I love my family.
Good night, Calvin.
