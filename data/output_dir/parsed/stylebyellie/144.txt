- This is, by far, the
coldest room in the house.
I asked you guys to ask some questions
because today Jared and
I are doing and Q and A.
- You've asked the questions
and we're gonna give the answers.
- I'm still likely to get closer to Jared.
- I don't mind that!
- 'Cause I'm flippin cold!
- I don't mind that one bit!
This is why we work well together.
'Kay?
I like to cuddle and you
like me to keep you warm.
- Sounds awesome.
Alright, question number one.
- I think we should
start off with probably
the most important question
that a lot of people have been
asking us and we've been meaning
to answer for a long time.
Would you rather fight
one horse-sized duck
or 100 duck-sized horses?
- You are making that up!
- It's right there, Ellie!
(laughing)
Spencer asked us!
- Okay, he's not, I thought
you were making that up.
- No I would never make up
something like that so serious.
So I know my answer,
do you have an answer?
- What's your answer?
- I would rather fight
one horse-sized duck
because in my hopes, I would
be able to tame said duck.
I would put a saddle on this duck
and hopefully this duck
would be able to fly around.
Alright, now for the real questions.
Out of all of life's lessons and love,
what is one wisdom or hope
you wish your children
will carry with them always?
That is a great question.
I hope our kids learn that
it's okay to help others.
It's okay to be there for someone.
And it's okay to think of
others before yourself.
But don't forget yourself.
- I really hope our kids are self-reliant.
I feel like if you can
take care of yourself
and your spouse and your family,
it gives tons of opportunities
to help other people.
- Absolutely.
- So I would say self-reliant.
When are you guys doing a holiday
with Daily Bumps and Cullen and Katie?
- Oooh, #DBEJCKWinterVacay, or vacay,
did I just give it away?
- It is so true
and it's been a little
bit harder to get together
all at the same time this last year.
There's just been,
all of us have done lots
of stuff with our family
and so it has been a littler
harder to get together
when we've wanted, but--
- We are looking into
doing a winter vacay.
No promises, but that's the plan.
I really want to know if
Ellie does her hair and makeup
more than she normally
would because of the vlogs?
She always looks so pretty.
Well that's very nice of you.
- Thank you.
No I do not do it more
because of the videos.
If you go back and even watch
the very first of the videos,
I mean I guess, doesn't make
sense 'cause we were filming
but even back at the beginning,
I always get ready the same amount.
When I was in hair school
and then working at a salon,
it's kind of expected to get ready.
Like you're helping
other people spruce up,
so it's just a habit of
just always getting ready.
And I feel better.
It doesn't take that
much time in the morning.
I wake up and that's one of
the first things I do is--
- Put on your makeup?
♫ Wake up
- Well just get ready.
- Oh.
(laughs)
- Like I wake up and we eat breakfast
and it's really not that much.
We have our routine.
I take the kids, get 'em dressed
and then sometimes they play with toys,
sometimes they sit in
the bathroom with me,
sometimes they watch a show,
and I take 20 minutes, wash
my face, put on some makeup.
♫ Grab a brush and put a little makeup
- Any advice for someone who
want to start daily vlogging?
Yes, I think I could
think of a few things.
When we started, we
didn't jump in completely
into every single day.
And I think that's a hard thing to do.
I enjoyed our transition from once a week
to a couple times a week to--
- Three times a week.
- Yeah, to daily.
I felt like that was good
for us to ease into it
and kinda tiptoe through it.
I always try and say,
do it for yourself first.
We have these videos
for our memories first
and then for everything else after.
- And we tell ourselves that even now,
hence why we're doing a Q and A today,
we don't do this very often,
but there's just lots going on right now
and instead of pulling it
out just to pull it out,
is not what I want to do.
And I've been enjoying that lately.
We have to remind ourselves that.
We don't have to film morning to night.
We can film in the evening.
We can film just the morning.
We can film--
- It's important to have
fun with what you're doing.
- Totally, and we do.
- When it's Christmas
will you get another pet?
I will pet Ellie's head and I will Penny,
but as another pet, probably not.
I would say no.
What is your favorite
off-camera family activity?
I don't know.
I play guitar and video games.
That's my personal thing.
What about you?
- What we do off camera,
we do lots of things off
camera, but something
that we specifically do
as an activity off camera?
- Not that.
But what do we do?
- Well, specifically,
we sing and dance a lot.
And we don't really film that as much.
And we have the music going quite a bit
and we all love to dance together.
- Especially Calvin.
- Yeah, you see Calvin
and Jackson dancing,
but we like to dance.
- How do you start a YouTube channel?
I really want to.
What are some tips on
where and how to edit?
So every time someone asks me
on starting a YouTube channel,
I point them the other direction
to Derral Eves, Tim
Schmoyer, Roberto Blake,
video influencers, all of those
channels that I listed there
are really, really great resources
to start a YouTube channel
and start it correctly.
- And we've told a lot of friends, too,
ask what you want on
YouTube in the search bar.
How to edit, how to do this,
and you will find videos
that really teach you how
and that's something that
I've had to do a lot too
is looking up stuff on YouTube.
- Which brings me to a question for you.
Some people have asked me how I edit,
what I use to edit, and
instead of just answering
those questions, I was
wondering if you guys
would be interested in seeing that done,
the process that we take.
Let me know in the comments down below
if you would like to see that
and give it a thumbs up
if you'd like to see that.
- I think you should.
I think that'd be awesome.
- Well we've got one person who wants to.
- Would you guys ever
consider leaving YouTube
and living more of a private life?
That is very interesting.
And to be honest, I love what we do.
I feel like it has given
Jared and I a big purpose.
I feel like we have had really amazing
opportunities to help people.
We've had amazing opportunities
to have fun with our family.
It's an amazing thing all around.
I don't think Jared and
I will ever stop sharing
whatever platform new comes out.
If whatever's after YouTube,
if something else is there,
we'll probably be on that.
I think that we enjoy that.
As far as living more of a
private life, absolutely.
I don't know what it's gonna be like
even in another two years,
like when Jackson goes to school.
I mean, we already are really careful
about not showing his preschool
and not showing his friends
and not showing the neighbor friends
when they come over and play.
And sometimes that's hard
because the neighbor kids,
Jackson had a friend over
the other day for four hours
and for four hours we didn't film
and so it's like,
in a way that's kinda
hard 'cause I wanted to,
but there are many things
that we keep private
and I've enjoyed what we have shared.
- Yeah.
So in short, we do live a pretty
private life on some parts.
And we do choose what we want to share.
- But as far as the future, I mean,
I think we'll always be sharing something.
What are your goals for the upcoming year?
Do you have any?
- I have some, no, yeah, I do,
I mean I have some business goals.
We have some projects that I want
to make sure get done in 2018,
which it seems like such a long time,
but with what we're doing,
it does take that time to get there.
- We have a lot of fun ambitions.
- Yeah.
Ellie and I were just talking about
how we want to take dance lessons.
I picture, in my head, all of the time,
a couple different things.
It's so dumb.
I don't know why.
- Don't say that!
- Well, just listen to what I say,
I picture myself, it's raining outside,
the lighting is perfect,
and then we're just dancing in the rain.
And we're just having a really great time.
And then another time--
- It's gonna snow in a few weeks.
You could dance with me in the snow.
- In the snow, that would be really cute.
The beginning of one of our videos,
it just has this really
fun three-quarter time,
is that a waltz?
And we're just dancing and
the intro of the music.
Yeah, I don't know, I just--
- I think that sounds amazing.
I want to do dance lessons with Jared.
- Beside date nights, what's your
favorite thing to do together?
Ellie and I like to do
a few things together.
One of which is we watch shows.
(Ellie laughs)
The other is we like
to take baths together.
- Mm-hmm.
- We have a big bathtub and
ever since we were married,
we've taken baths together and--
- Even in our small bathtub!
- Yeah the tubs beforehand were so tiny,
but now this one that
we have is pretty big,
so I like, yeah!
Bath time!
- It's fun to take baths.
And we just sit and we talk about our day.
It's just nice to unwind in a warm bath.
And we also get in the hot tub,
but there's something fun about the tub
where we're just squished in there.
(laughing)
What do you think Matt and Em are having?
- For those who don't
know, my brother Matt
and his wife Emily are expecting.
- And I think that they
are gonna have a girl.
- I would love for them to have a girl.
But I think they're gonna have a boy.
(laughs)
- I don't know very many,
I know a lot of families
that have a lot of kids.
I don't know of very many families
that just have four straight
girls or four straight boys.
So that's what I think will happen.
- My cousin has four straight boys
and then their last one was a girl.
So that's definitely--
- We'll see.
But I don't know, I can
see them having a girl.
- What show or shows are you
addicted to at the moment?
Ellie, give it to 'em.
- Parenthood.
Do you think vlogging
makes you better parents,
worse, or the same?
And I definitely feel like I am the parent
and I teach the kids and I don't
put vlogging into that mix.
- Yeah.
With or without YouTube, our
parenting would be the same.
- And saying with or without YouTube,
am I a giving person or am I a nice wife
or do I lose my patience?
I lose my patience just as much
as if I vlogged or didn't vlog
and same with parenting
and I think it is so, so important
that there is separation.
- Absolutely.
- And I do, I do feel like there's a very,
and big importance that
there is separation.
- Because it could get to the point
where there is an interference.
Why do you call your in-laws Mom and Dad?
I have a couple different--
- 'Cause they're my mom and dad!
- Yeah.
We're family.
We married into the family
and that's one thing.
But I also feel like
it's a sign of respect.
To me, there's nothing
more valuable and important
than calling someone Mom or Dad.
Because that, it's a title to me.
And there's so much weight
that goes along with it.
To call them by anything else, I think,
would be taking away from that title.
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
And not everyone may feel comfortable
and that's totally okay.
Totally okay.
- Like if Ellie's mom
and dad didn't want me
to call them Mom and Dad,
I would respect that.
- Oh yeah.
And if you,
it doesn't mean you don't love them
just as much if you don't.
Jared and I have always just
felt very the same about it.
- What's the best part about sharing
your life with the world?
Seeing that we can put
a smile on your face
puts a smile on our face
and it's this community that
we have that is just amazing.
- It's nothing like I
ever thought it would be.
It was really cool,
the video we were able
to help make for Andy,
and how for years they've
been trying to find a match
and they finally found someone in England
that they've been talking to.
That is,
that I have to sit back and be like,
this is why we do it.
Ariel and Riley just had their baby--
- Wait.
They just had their baby!
- She just had a baby and it's like,
that is why we do what we do.
And we do so much fun stuff,
but at the end of the day,
when I look back and when
I am teaching our kids
why we've done what we've done,
that's why.
It's been a really cool experience
and it's hard to explain
to people, friends, family sometimes,
but someday they'll get it.
And I understand it and I love what we do
and I wouldn't,
I love what we do.
- That was beautiful.
(laughing)
Slow clap.
I'm serious, though.
It was really sweet.
Yeah, it was sweet!
- Well I meant it.
- What do your boys want for Christmas?
I need some inspiration.
(laughing) Your kid
stories are always awesome.
Well, what does Jackson want?
He wants one thing.
- What does he want?
(both) A marble run.
Anything that does with music,
both boys really love music right now.
So any sort of instrument
would be really fun for them.
- So, Santa, if you're listening,
(clicks tongue) write that down.
(laughs)
If you could move anywhere in the world
except the United States,
where would it be and why?
Can you think of a place?
- I haven't really been out,
so I don't have much to go off of,
but I would say New Zealand.
- Yeah.
Ellie's aunt used to live there,
so we've heard really great things.
Plus that's where Hobbiton is.
Is that what that place, where
the hobbits live is called?
I can't remember.
I would love to live in Finland again.
I really, really would.
We plan on going back there.
It's still on our list.
- This is a really good one
and it might be our last.
How do both of you settle
arguments, disagreements you have,
about kids, YouTube, et cetera?
- We get out the boxing
gloves and we punch it out.
Just punch it out real good.
- I feel like we're both
pretty good to talk things out.
That's not always the case though.
Sometimes one of us is a lot
more angry than the other.
And it's, and that's normal.
- But that's the thing that
we've always strived for
was a good communication,
and we're not perfect.
And we're gonna go more into
this in a relationship Q and A
that I just, we talked about today.
We're not perfect.
But we do try and communicate
and that is such an important thing.
Is the communication.
I can't remember if I said it in a video
that's going up later this week
or if it was already back,
no it's for the House Q and A.
It's important to have a lot
of these decisions made--
- Before the argument even happens.
- Exactly.
Before you get to there.
And that will solve a ton of problems.
- Another thing that I think is helpful
is I've had a lot of
friends go to counseling
and I feel like sometimes
counseling gets a bad rap,
where it's like you've gone to counseling
'cause there's issues.
- Oh, it's bad.
- I've talked to a few
friends that they're like,
it's just good just to
have another open mind.
To listen to what's going on
and to help you work things out.
Not necessarily even if you're like,
even if you're not arguing and fighting,
it's still good to go to a counselor.
And I think that that
may even be good advice
before someone's married,
to go in and to talk about money,
finances, intimacy, and religion,
and just that way, there's
already a counselor there
and you're just working
things out and talking.
I think that that would be good advice.
We didn't do it, but I
am not opposed to that.
- Oh, I'd never be opposed.
When you were saying that,
I was like, you know what?
It might be fun to just do that.
- I think it would be smart.
- And just to talk.
- 'Cause everyone has arguments.
We have disagreements and I
feel like we get over them good,
but I still feel like that's something
that's not talked about, at
least that I don't hear about.
And I feel like my friends and
people I know that have gone
to counselors have been
very positive about it
and said that it's a really good thing.
- Absolutely.
And like you said, there's
usually a bad stigma
associated with going to a counselor.
That's not true at all.
People go there all the time.
Just to improve.
- I think stuff like that is
becoming a little bit more,
it's not just a negative thing.
Kinda like depression, it's like,
a lot of people have depression.
It's okay to go get help.
And I think when, sometimes
people first hear that,
it's like, Oh you have depression.
It's like, well, no.
- It's always okay to ask for help.
And I feel like we should
say this right now.
If you feel like you are
struggling with anything right now,
don't wait.
Go ask for help.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
There's nothing to be ashamed about!
I'll tell you a story.
I went to a counselor
when I was a little kid
when I was thinking negative
things about myself.
And we did a whole video about that.
When I was 12 to 14, it was one of our
very first year of vlogging.
Not ashamed about it at all.
Loved the outcome of it.
And it's only gonna help.
I feel like that's a good point to end on.
- Yeah, me too.
- So, I feel like--
- Thank you guys for your questions.
I hope that we answered them okay.
And it was really fun sitting down
and doing a Q and A.
- Yeah.
So we will see you guys very soon.
We're off to another country right now.
- And we'll be back soon.
- Thanks for watching. Bye.
