what is your favorite and
what you're planning to get.
I found a worm on the sidewalk.
-  Whoa (laughs)
Did you have a good day?
Yeah.
Can I have a kiss?
(smooches)
If I'm being completely honest,
I didn't think this would
be happening right now.
Right now.
This soon.
-  This soon, this is a lot quicker
than I thought it would be.
It is time to move everything out.
-  Good morning.
(laughing)
(whispering) Are we
trying to be really quiet?
(whispering) Yeah, everyone's asleep, huh?
Even little Miss Penny.
(laughing)
What are you thinking?
(barks)
(Ellie laughs)
Are you gonna drive it more?
We need to charge, I
thought it was charging.
We might need to charge it more.
(barking)
(barking)
Pen Pen.
(laughing)
-  Penny might like
it more than Jackson does.
Oh!
-  Penny!
You okay?
Yeah, I think (fades).
-  We should charge it huh?
(upbeat music)
'Kay, hold it and put it in!
Whoa (laughing)
(talking excitedly)
I'm gonna be racing.
-  Come here, Mr. Cal!
You are doing so good.
I think this may be Calvin's second time
with one of these carts.
He usually just likes to sit in the cart.
You are doing so good at teaching him.
You even held his cart while
I was getting the meat,
and he was like, no, not yet, Calvin.
(laughs)
Do you guys remember watching the vlog
where Jackson, I think he
had one of those carts,
and he was really little,
but I had told him,
I was like, if you don't
follow me and listen,
we're gonna leave.
And we ended up having to leave the store
because he had thrown
a fit and it was like,
he didn't do it since.
And it just seems fun.
We've come here for Jackson's whole life
and watching him--
Mom, I need a treat--
-  You want to get a treat?
After we're all done shopping.
'Kay?
And it's just interesting.
We've been coming here
since Jackson was little,
like when he was first potty trained,
gotta run to the bathroom
and he had to go to the bathroom.
He learned how to be really
good using these carts.
Calvin, come here!
I did got thinking I learned
how to poop in a toilet right now!
-  'Kay, you kids
are being really good.
We bought all of our groceries.
Most of them, anyway.
Ah, you've gotta be soft.
Gotta be soft with it.
I don't even know what I'm trying to say.
I think I'm rambling.
Just, it's been really fun
coming to this grocery store
and watching the kids grow and learn.
Because, you know, you go
grocery shopping a lot.
And it's kind of a good
place to teach them.
You know? (laughs)
'Kay, you're doing so
good, I'm so proud of you!
Hold on tight, mister.
Are you holding on tight?
(babbling)
(Ellie laughs)
It is day two of coming home from China,
so as far as jet lag goes, (laughs)
I am tired.
I did wake up pretty early this morning.
I was wide awake really early,
before everyone woke up.
Calvin and I woke up together.
And so I cleaned up the kitchen,
got everyone fed, we slowly
got ready for the day.
And I, yesterday, since coming home,
we didn't have much food in the fridge.
And so we went out to eat
and it was kind of a bad idea
'cause I just felt even more gross.
So today I am making some awesome stew.
I am making some beef soup.
Potatoes, carrots, celery,
all that, for dinner,
but it's gonna take all day to cook
so that's there and I'm gonna make
some stuffed bell peppers for lunch.
We got a bunch of Hello
Fresh in the mail today
so we are kind of set for the week.
So I feel much better about that.
But my stomach, I'm just like, I need,
like the soup sounds so good to me.
I wish I could eat it right now.
I wish it didn't take all day to cook.
But, that's what I'm doing.
Jackson, are you gonna go ride your,
are you taking your car out for a ride?
Yeah.
-  'Kay (laughing).
Just held the door open.
Let's get your shoes on!
What'd you find?
I found a worm on the sidewalk.
-  Wow.
It rained a lot today.
And all the worms came out.
I'm done playing.
-  'Kay, go put the worm out
and then we'll wash your hands.
Go put him back outside and
then we can come back in.
It's my worm.
-  It's your worm?
I don't want him inside.
Should we put him in a jar
and you can look at him?
No, is he gonna die?
-  Yeah, if we put him in a jar.
I leave him out is he gonna die?
-  Nope, if you put
him back outside, he'll live.
In the grass, he'll
have his food and water.
Why don't we go find a
good spot for him outside?
No, maybe inside.
Maybe baggie.
-  A bag?
Is he gonna die in it?
-  Yeah, I think
he needs to stay outside.
'Cause that's where he'll live the best.
'Kay?
He doesn't want to go outside anymore.
-  (chuckles) He doesn't?
Mm-mmm, I don't want him to.
-  'Kay, you
look at him for a minute
and then you go put him
out when you're done.
It's a noodle!
-  It's a noodle?
(laughs) I think he would taste gross.
Calvin just ran out to me and goes,
Boots, off!
My boots off!
And so I took his shoes off
and the moment they were off,
he ran into a puddle of water and splashed
and jumped and laughed.
Come here!
And now he's tip-toeing
back 'cause he's barefoot.
Come show me your pants.
(babbling)
Do you got an owwie?
Let's see.
Ah, well your pants are
soaking wet from the puddle.
Goofy.
Oh, rocks!
Wow.
If I'm being completely honest,
I didn't think this would
be happening right now.
Right now.
This soon.
This soon.
This is a lot quicker than
I thought it would be.
It is time to move everything out.
'Kay, Jackson, you hear that?
We've gotta move everything out.
All of this has to go.
'Kay?
Can you help us with that?
Why does it need to go?
-  Well why do
you think it needs to go?
I don't want these things to go.
-  (laughs) You
wanna keep these things?
Yeah.
-  Okay, well
I have some good news.
They're just going into the garage.
We're moving all of this
stuff into the garage
because the hardwood floors are going
to be refinished and resurfaced.
I don't know if we've
talked about it on the vlog,
but there's a couple places.
I have one in particular
right outside my office.
Where it's just,
you know, it's separating
just a little bit.
So we need, do you feel that?
Is that kinda sharp?
So the hardwood floor guys
are coming on our anniversary.
(laughs)
Happy eight years!
-  Happy eight year anniversary,
we're getting the hardwood floors done.
And they're coming to take care of it.
Oh, you wanna help too?
Okay.
I've got some good helpers.
-  Thanks!
Don't worry, grandpa,
you're a good helper too.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
Ready?
Ready.
'Kay, we got our luggage.
-  See you later!
-  Penny, you are
gonna be slipping around
like nobody's business! (laughs)
On the hardwood floors, anytime Penny
tries to take a fast
corner, she goes flying.
(laughs) Like she knows she
has to be hesitant a little bit
with her body, running around.
That's so funny.
The other thing I wanna
see is if you can see
the square where the rug has been.
Because, obviously there's
no foot traffic there
because of the rug.
And it's (laughing).
You're slipping and sliding everywhere!
Can you see the square?
Looks a little glossier.
Oh my gosh, you can see
it way better on camera.
(laughing)
It's almost like it's moving day.
I know, I hate it.
I don't ever wanna do it again.
Do you remember when we walked in
and we were just like, holy crap.
This is home.
I still feel that way.
Oh yeah.
Every time we wake up and come out here,
it's like, wow.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
We've got the frames of
the couches in the garage
and all of these cushions
are in Calvin's room.
We've got a ton of couch
cushions right here.
You have so many couch
cushions in one place.
So many blankets in one place.
You think I know what I need to do.
And I'm gonna do that thing
that you're thinking of right now.
(upbeat music)
Alright, there it is.
(laughing)
We've got our entryway here.
And we've got one path
that goes down here.
And we've got another
path that goes down here,
thanks to the help of George the giraffe,
who's being so good to us right now.
I think it's time we show the kids.
Oh, boys!
Time to come upstairs!
It echoes so much in here! (laughs)
(gibberish)
Come up here.
What is it?
-  I'll show you!
Are you ready to see this?
Yeah.
-  Open your eyes!
Whoa!
What?
-  It's a fort!
Crawl inside!
(laughing)
Do you like it?
How did you do this?!
-  I used all the
couch cushions and blankets
and I made it.
How?
-  With my imagination.
I built it.
Crawl under here, there's
another path that you missed.
Go with him, Calvin.
(laughing)
Is that so cool?
Did you like it?
Yeah.
(Jared laughing)
(Jackson and Jared laughing)
Is this cool?
Yeah.
Bye!
Bye.
Hi, Calvin.
Hi, bye.
Hi, bye.
Aww, is he dancing?
(upbeat music)
Whoa!
Little too much spin there.
-  Are you gonna dance
with me when we're done?
(Jared gasps)
-  That sounds fun.
(upbeat music)
We had a dance party.
Then we ate some Oreos.
Then we let Penny in.
And now we're having another dance party.
Are you guys gonna go finish dancing?
Go finish dancing before we go to bed.
Whoo!
Yay!
(Jared laughing)
(singing)
(laughing)
(singing)
Did you have a good day?
Yeah.
Can I have a kiss?
(smooches)
You're pretty happy today, huh?
He's been extra good today.
Someone came and snuck in here.
(whispering) Daddy's
looking for you, Calvin.
(kids shriek)
(kids laughing)
What are you doing in here?!
(boys laughing)
Do you wanna sleep with
your brother tonight?
Mommy's bed.
-  You wanna sleep in Mommy's bed?
Yeah!
-  No, let's go sleep in your bed.
Yeah!
No.
In your bed, in your bed!
-  Everyone in their own beds.
-  Silly pants.
(Calvin laughing)
-  Who tootied?
I know, I came in smelling that.
I'm like, oh my gosh
we have a poopy diaper
or someone who needs to go poopy.
(Calvin laughing)
-  Maybe Calvin,
he's been pooping all day.
-  No.
(Jared laughing)
-  Jackson, did you toot?
-  (laughing) Yeah.
-  You're so stinky.
