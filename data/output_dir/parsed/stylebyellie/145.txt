(playful spooky music)
(digital beeps)
- And here's a Mario.
(laughing)
-  We've got a fog machine
and we don't know if this is good or bad.
Oh look, he's wearing it Ellie.
- I got rid of Bowser.
- Give me a kiss.
Oh!
- There they are.
I'm gathering Jackson's
costume up this morning
for his pre-school party.
And the kids have been waking up
and wanting to keep the lights off
when they eat breakfast,
and I think it's the cutest thing.
They were cold, so they
were sitting on the heater
and now, we turned the fireplace on.
Is that fun?
- Yeah.
-  Wow.
So we're eating breakfast.
- You know what I'm going to this week?
-  What?
- School party.
-  A school party.
Cool Jackson.
Oh it's starting to warm up.
- I'm gonna put my glove on real quick.
- Okay, hey Jackson.
- I didn't mean to hit you.
- It's okay.
Jackson, he has a hard time
wearing clothes under his outfit,
but it's cold outside.
So if we just wear your pajamas
that are really thin.
Waa!
Come here.
-  I need to
get the other glove on.
- Okay, do it right here.
Okay.
Oh thank you so much.
- Ha ha ha ha.
- Ah ha!
- Come here.
You look good.
(growling)
(gentle music)
Does it look okay?
- Yeah.
-  Oh good.
I was gonna say we should do your hair,
but I guess we don't really need to.
- Nope.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Let's at least
go brush your teeth.
- Like this.
-  Oh good, oh can I kiss you?
Woo!
-  Oh my goodness,
you got some sweet loot
from pre-school, huh?
- That's sour worms.
-  Jackson tell
me about pre-school.
- I've been at pre-school
and I cleaned up.
-  You cleaned up?
- I ate snacks and I didn't go outside.
-  You didn't?
- No.
- You just played inside?
- Yeah.
-  What games?
- Monster Mash.
-  Mine?
- Nuh uh uh uh uh.
- My bag.
- Where's my bag?
- You know what?
-  Calvin are we
gonna go trick or treating
tonight, where's your bucket?
-  Go get your bucket
and we'll go trick or treating tonight.
-  Want to go trick or treat?
Okay, let me show you what I did
to the table.
Come here mister.
Planning is just as much fun
as being in the party
and I am planning right now.
I'm getting ready for lunch
- What?
-  and I have the table set.
Look, there's eyeballs in the drinks.
Everyone's name, this is
Boston's, eyes in the drinks,
waiting for some cousins.
We're gonna have a little
bit of lunch with cousins
and then we'll go our separate ways
to go trick or treating.
- I don't know why I didn't
think of this before,
but I think I hate this part of me is
I'm very last minute,
when it comes to things and planning
like having good ideas,
it's like oh very last minute,
then I'm like stressed and
rushing and everything,
but I got Penny a costume.
- I hope she loves it.
-  She's gonna hate it.
- She's gonna not love it.
- She's not gonna love it,
but we'll try and see.
If we can get one picture out of it,
it's worth it.
-  Oh my.
- It's a Thor costume.
How cute is that.
- Come on Penny,
-  you're in this family.
- Should I go get changed into my costume?
-  Totally.
- Okay, I'll be right back.
(upbeat digital music)
- What do you think, it's a me, a Mario.
Ha ha, come on out.
-  So Jackson, we need to get you
in your Mario costume.
- Come on.
-  I like how he
said no and then okay.
What?
- It's a my buddy Mario.
- Here's a Mario.
(laughing)
-  You look so cute.
- Mario wants to play hide the pumpkin.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Mario wants to
play hide the pumpkin?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, when you're done we will.
Did you already do that one?
That looks awesome.
- Yeah.
- No it looks scary.
-  It is scary.
Holy moly,
you just grew up overnight
and grew a beard.
Hi Calvin.
Can he help do some stickers too
on this pumpkin?
-  I think so
it's meant for indoors.
We've got a fog machine
and we don't know if this is good or bad.
It's fogging, I guess it's a good thing.
Ooh wee ooh.
What do you think Jackson?
(cries)
-  Does it kind of
scare you a little bit?
- I think we should put
it outside, so they won't
-  Maybe at the front door, yeah.
- Actually yeah, ooh.
-  Breathe my friend.
- So as they walk in,
it's foggy.
- Yeah, we can do that.
-  Holy moly.
-  Whoa, can't see anything.
- This is crazy.
- So these are the costumes of the year.
I am Mario.
Calvin is Toad.
His hat is seriously the cutest thing.
- And Peach.
-  You are my
princess, Princess Peach,
you look so beautiful.
- Thanks to Bonnie's old prom
dress that doesn't quite fit,
but I figured it out.
-  Oh where are your gloves?
Your beautiful white gloves.
They're by the front door,
for when I greet people.
- Oh how sweet.
And Jackson,
Jackson's Mario too, like
father like son, you know.
I knew this was gonna happen.
I got him a Luigi costume,
because I thought it would be fun
to have Mario and Luigi,
but he saw the Luigi and he's like uh-uh,
I am not player two, I'm player one,
I'm gonna be Mario.
I couldn't find Bowser for Penny,
so we got this Thor costume,
and we're gonna put it on her right now.
There we go.
-  Pen.
That looks cute on her.
Is it too tight?
- No I don't think so,
it stretches really good.
-  She's not gonna move.
-  Here let's get this hair out.
-  She's not gonna move.
She like nope.
This is kinda like the lead collar.
She will not walk with it, she hates it.
She's not gonna move.
She's not moved.
Come on Pen.
She's not gonna move.
- Good girl.
-  Aww Pen.
- We are not gonna make her suffer.
We are gonna grab one picture
and then we'll take it off of her.
-  Oh fine.
Well take it off.
You don't like costumes.
Just go play, come on.
- I got a special treat for her.
Because she was such a good dog.
- Grandpa.
- Yes.
- It's a locket.
- You're such a good boy
- To keep your hands
down, so I can show you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Isn't that pretty?
-  Okay (laughs).
- Okay, put your hands down now.
Okay, thank you.
-  Hi mom.
- Isn't he cute?
-  Yes.
- Hi, thank you for inviting me.
-  You're welcome,
your headband's cute.
- Thought I'd leave my day wide open,
so I can just hop in the car and come.
-  I know, I'm glad you're here.
- That's so funny.
-  He always
tickles when he kisses.
- So she is, what's her name?
- Princess Peach.
- Yeah Peach.
- Peach.
- Toad.
- And he's Toad.
- I always picked Princess Peach,
when we were playing
- Oh yeah.
- but I always lost with her.
-  Yeah, she's the worst.
- Yeah, I liked her because she was cute.
-  Who's that?
-  Let's go get the door.
-  Go get the
door, go get the door.
Go get the door.
(gasps)
Hi Grandma and Grandpa oh pfft.
(laughing)
Hi Grandma.
-  He's like I know
there are goodies in those bags.
- Don't you look cute.
- I love it.
(enchanting music)
- Whatcha doing?
Wait til everybody comes.
- Dad, when they get here,
I'm gonna say, it's me a Mario.
-  Aww that's perfect.
- A Mario, I don't know how you said that.
It'll be so cute.
- Princess Peach.
- Princess Peach.
You danced with me today, huh?
He's so cute.
- It's me a Mario, Princess.
- Oh nice to meet you Mario.
- You look cute.
- You're handsome.

Stay here, let him answer it, stay here.
- It's me, a Mario.
-  Hi.
- It's me a Mario.
- Hi.
-  Hi.
- You look real.
-  It's a Mario.
Don't worry, our house is not on fire.
- It's a me a Mario.
- Aww and you're the princess.
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.
-  Come on in guys.
Alright kiddos, come find your seats.
-  Hey Boston,
yours is right here mister.
-  Eyeballs in
the juice, yum yum yum.
- Can you find
- Blue eye juice
-  Can you guys find
the eyeballs in your juice?
- I found three of them.
- I'm gonna start with Olivia,
is everyone hungry?
- Oh yeah.
-  We are starving.
- I found one.
-  You found one eyeball?
- Oh this is my favorite, I love it.
- We say this in the name
of Jesus Christ, Amen.
-  Amen.
- It was muffled.
- It was a big muffled.
-  It was muffled,
I couldn't quite hear you.
(upbeat spooky music)
-  Oh my goodness,
you found the eyeballs
in the blood.
- I have three of them.
- I found a blue one.
-  You found a green one?
Nice.
-  I've got two
blues and one brown.
- I've got a green one and a brown one.
- Oh my goodness.
Well if you guys know anyone
who are missing eyeballs,
we have a few left over, so.
- I have a green and a blue.
-  You have a green and a blue?
Nice.
This is so fun.
Okay Burt Reynolds, tell
me how you did this.
Like I can't drink anything.
-  It's meant to strain it.
- Oh it's a strainer.
Okay so I
(smacking lips)
-  I think the trick is a straw.
- Oh a straw.
That's not a very good idea.
- That's not very manly is it.
- No it's not.
Hey Ellie, will you grab me a straw?
Oh, you're still recording.
Aww Grandma, handing
out goody bags already.
-  I wore my costume.
- Yeah, we wore our costumes,
right, should we get a treat Mom?
Oh look, he's wearing it Ellie.
He's wearing it.
-  Oh yay.
- Thanks Boston, you're a miracle worker,
you know that?
- Yeah.
- Isn't Mario a miracle worker?
- You're right Mario is a miracle worker.
Thanks for reminding me.
Yum.
Have you guys seen Princess Peach?
- Yeah.
- No.
-  Have you seen Princess Peach?
Where's Princess Peach?
- I think I know where
she, oh I don't know.
- Where'd she go?
-  She disappeared.
- What is this?
-  Can I read it?
- Yeah what does it say?
- Bwahahaha.
If you're looking for Princess Peach,
Mario, well I've taken her
and you can't stop me.
Roar, Bowser.
- I think Bowser took Princess Peach.
- I know, it's a clue.
-  You think you see a clue?
- It says a pit and fire,
there's nothing in here,
so maybe it's outside.
-  Maybe you're right.
-  I don't want
to see real Bowser.
- Okay, we're not gonna see real Bowser.
-  I got a clue, I got a clue.
-  You found a clue?
You found one?
- Last I saw, he was heading
for the clouds.
Go save Princess Peach.
Luigi?
-  Luigi.
(upbeat digital music)
Let's go get this one.
-  Oh my gosh, Jackson's so fast.
-  Can you hand
it to Olivia to read it?
- Unfortunately I was so dizzy
that I couldn't tell
actually where he went,
but it seemed he was heading for the light
that keeps the night lit up.
Your friend Toad.
-  Looks like we might
have to look for a light.
You think there might be
a clue next to a light?
- I know a light.
-  Well let's go look for it.
- Can you hold these?
- Sure I can hold these.
So a little clue update,
we lost one of the clues.
But luckily, these kids are so good
at deductive reasoning,
they just skipped it, went for it.
Did you find it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Boston let me read it.
-  Yeah, let's let Olivia read it.
- I'll push him into the jail cell
and lock him inside.
I'll look for a soft place to land
like a chair or a couch
and then jump off the ship.
I hope you find me soon.
Princess Peach.
-  That's from Princess Peach?
- Mmm-hmm.
-  Where did she say she would go?
- I think she said couch.
-  Couch?
Should we look on the couch?
- Yeah.
-  Let's go.
- Princess Peach?
-  There she is!
It's Princess Peach.
- Princess Peach!
- Did you find me?
-  You guys found her.
I got rid of Bowser.
(gasps)
- Where is he?
They threw him away.
- Don't ask too many questions.
- You know what?
I have a prize because you found me.
- Woo!
- Woo!
- Okay, everyone come sit on the couch
and Princess Peach will give us a prize.
Come get on the couch.
Good job Princess Peach.
Well where is he?
We want to find him.
- He didn't get through it very well.
Tell me what was your
favorite thing out there.
- My favorite thing was finding the clues.
- Ooh.
- My favorite thing was
finding the clues too.
- It was?
- My favorite thing was everything.
- Here's yours.
Here's yours.
- I'm this guy.
- Yours is right there Calvin.
- Here he likes it, he likes costumes now.
-  Now he likes it.
- Go bark at Daddy, go bark at Daddy,
say ruff ruff.
Say ruff.
-  I'll open it, say ruff ruff.
- Ruff ruff.
-  I got Papa Troll wow.
- I got Princess Peach.
-  You got Princess
Peach, that's awesome.
- I thought you got me a Papa Troll.
-  Oh.
- That's a different universe.
Different universe in the story line.
-  Do you want me to open it?
- Yeah.
- I thought it looked like Papa Troll.
-  And you got Bowser?
We found him.
The very first house we
go to trick or treating
is a very special house
and we're gonna go and do
our very first trick or treat house.
Party pooper and all.
(knocking on door)
-  Say it loud when they answer.
- Somebody's knocking on our door.
(gasps)
- Trick or treat.
-  Yay.
- It's Spiderman.
- Spiderman!
- Hi.
And a sleeping baby.
- Longtime no see.
- Would you like a treat?
-  Say thank you.
- I forgot to mention we had
a little costume change.
-  Yeah, I noticed that.
-  He was just like,
I want to go as Spiderman.
- Thank you Grandma.
-  Do you want to
give 'em a hug and a kiss?
- No thanks.
(laughing)
-  Has she
recovered from her costume?
- I know seriously,
look at her just eyeing the kids.
-  Go show Penny.
(laughing)
- See here full.
-  You got more?
(Ellie laughs)
- Calvin, come on.
-  We're good.
-  Good.
-  Say thanks Cal.
-  Looks like some
kind of a wild animal.
- Hey, did they let you go inside
and pet their dog?
- Yeah.
- You did, you did huh?
He went inside and pet the dog.
Those are our friends from church, huh?
That was fun.
Jackson is trick or treating
with his best friend Cody,
not his cousin Cody, but his best friend.
He has a thing for Cody's, I guess.
Isn't that hilarious?
His best friend's name is Cody.
No stay here.
They're used to your house.
Stay here.
- Maybe I'll get one.
- Yeah, you want one more?
-  Say thanks Jackson.
- Thanks.
-  Last but not least Jacks.
Did you grab one?
-  Did you grab one Jackson?
You want that one over there?
- Let me see what's in your bucket.
Whoa.
Cal, what about you?
Whoa.
Was that the funnest?
- Yeah.
-  Did you like that?
- Yeah.
- Is everyone gonna come to our house?
-  Yeah, but now
when the door rings,
do you want to answer
and give them candy bars?
- Sure.
-  Okay.
-  Is everyone coming?
-  We'll have to
wait 'til the door rings.
- Was that fun or what.
- That was perfect.
-  Aww.
- We went around the whole block.
Saw all their friends.
- I know and our friends too.
Ellie, we have friends.
- It was just fun taking our kids out.
- Yes it was.
I don't know how people
with mustaches do it.
Like it's getting all up in my business
and it's itchy and scratchy too.
- Hey, what's the first
thing they're doing.
Go look at them.
-  What are they doing?
-  He opened.
- Oh you're already, whoa!
(laughs)
Slipped on an eyeball on the ground,
that's not dangerous at all.
I almost lost myself,
good thing I have the agility of Mario.
Are you guys going through
all your candy already?
- Can you open this?
-  Goldfish, yeah
actually that's perfect,
we can totally have that.
- We have a unicorn.
(bright music)
-  Trick or treat.
(yells)
- Say ahh.
- Ahh.
- Ahh.
Guess what, you have
your two year old molars
breaking through right now.
-  I saw them.
- Right now,
as I was brushing his teeth to go to bed,
I was like, oh, there you go.
They're in there.
-  Good, more teeth
to chew all that candy
up with that you got.
- Calvin, did you have
fun trick or treating?
- Choc
- Did you get chocolate?
- Yeah.
- Oh good.
You don't have to show us.
-  He says I I I I want more.
(laughing)
What did he say?
- He said hey no.
- Hey don't run away.
Did you have fun trick or treating?
(growling)
- Yeah.
Did you go door to door?
- Yeah treat.
- And did you see your friends
and a dog, and you got snacks,
- Yeah.
- lots of them?
- Give me a kiss.
Oh!
(laughing)
- Say excuse me.
Say goodnight Dad, kisses.
- Don't try and burp now.
What a wonderful Halloween day
we were able to spend with family.
It is now one in the morning
and I'm finishing everything up
before Ellie and I head off to China
with Bonnie and Joel tomorrow.
So for now, thank you
guys so much for watching.
And we will see you guys soon.
The next few videos that you guys see
are going to be special videos
that we have filmed in
anticipation of our trip,
because we will not be able to upload
while we are gone,
but we will be filming while we are gone.
So stay tuned for that.
It's going to be great.
And we will see you guys next time.
Thanks for watching, bye.
