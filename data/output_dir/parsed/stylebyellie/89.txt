- Everybody say cheese!
-  Cheese!
- Who's ready for the Christmas?
Christmas party!
(cheering)
(upbeat festive music)
(laughter)
- Merry Christmas!
- You got your cookies for Santa.
I got my cookies for Santa.
I have a huge headache and I just took
medicine that probably will not help.
Let's start this
Christmas party off right!
- Let's get the Griswold family
Christmas party special started!
- What does Griswold say with his...
Eggnog?
Where is the dang Tylenol!
Something like that, I
need to find that clip.
- Where's the Tylenol?
- We all need that.
Who needs some Tylenol?
Let's go!
- Catch!
There you go!
- Did that hurt you?
- No.
Did you hear him?
Did that hurt you?
- We have a full day of activities planned
for this holiday Christmas party
and it's all thanks to Landon and Julie
in charge of the
Christmas party this year.
And the first activity that we're doing,
oh, I dropped my shirt.
Sorry, car's waiting for
me, sorry about that.
The first activity that we're doing,
is we're going to a place called, Dartside
and we're having Nerf gun wars!
I'm really excited about
this, I even brought clothes
to change into because
it's gonna get intense.
(upbeat festive music)
Merry Christmas everyone!
Are you guys ready for this?
You ready to be taken down?
Are you ready to lose?
You ready to go up against the champ?
Number one!
Ugly?
Mom, there is nothing ugly about this.
You gotta put gear on,
just maternity pants?
There you go.
- Hey, I'm wearing the same ones.
- Maternity pants?
Alright.
- The plan we're going in,
doesn't count as two person
so it's like...
- Two points.
- Two on two, yeah, and if you hit them,
you get two points, if I hit you.
- Us verse her.
- Two people versus.
- Two people, really.
But you guys she only has one gun,
so you only get one gun,
you have to share it.
- Everybody's getting
their teams figured out.
This guy, everyone is laughing at him,
it's like, what toddler just like,
lays on the table and just sleeps?
Calvin does!
He's sleeping so I gotta
sit here and be with Calvin
while everybody shoots.
- It is time to divide up the teams,
it's orange versus yellow!
Uh oh, Jackson, looks like
we're on the opposite teams.
What team are you on?
Say yeah!
- Yeah!
- You guys all have pockets on your vests?
What I want you to do is I
want you to show your neighbor
how to close the gun the right way.
- These kids have never listened
to something so intently before.
They're like, I'm ready for this.
I've waited my whole life for this moment!
Here you go, bud.
Hey, let's remember, yeah,
pull that back, pull it back.
And then we put a dart
in, push the button,
good job!
Hey Jackson, this is
where we part ways, okay?
So we'll meet in the
middle and we'll attack!
You ready?
- Where's my bullet?
- They're all over there on the ground,
so you grab one and put it inside, okay?
- Alright yellow team, here's the deal,
it's team elimination, that means
if you get shot, you're
out, so the goal is,
to shoot as many people as you can
without getting shot, can you do that?
-  Yeah!
- That's what I'm talking
about, yellow team for the win!
You ready, Bonas?
- Oh, we're gonna do it.
- Uncle Jerry, you get Chad.
- I will get Chad.
- Yellow team, you ready?
- Yeah!
- Here we go, three...
- Two, one!
Let's go!
(upbeat music)
Jackson almost got me!
(upbeat music)
ah, Cody!
Cody got my bum!
Cody got my bum, no!
Alright guys, it's up to
you, you're our last hope.
- Oh, yeah!
Hi Jackson!
Get him.
Nice shot!
(cheering)
Olivia, we're on the same team!
(upbeat music)
Olivia got me, with the
battle wound and everything.
Guys, I'm out!
I'm out!
- Jared, I see you.
Bows, who do you want on your team?
Around needs a Bo on their team.
He's the only one working over there.
(upbeat music)
He's a sneaky, sneaky guy.
Did you just wake up?
The worker was like, staring at him
and Calvin was like, staring at him.
- Staring contest, you and me.
(intense music)
(lively music)
reloading...
I think they're shooting because they're
ganging up on the like, referee.
This is the coolest!
Hi!
Oh my gosh, well,
everybody played together,
now the adults are playing.
What!
This is another area
for the kids to play at.
So fun!
Did you just wake up, mister?
Good morning!
- Good luck, cause some
trouble, have some fun.
- Jackson, did you have fun?
How cute is that!
Get up there, get up there.
What did you think of that game?
- Good.
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.
- Did you play with your cousins?
- Mm-hmm.
- He's like, too busy, he wants to play.
Aw, did you see that all these bodies.
What!
That is the coolest!
I'm watching, wow!
That is cool!
Do you like that choo choo train?
That's right up Henry's alley.
Should we go get our shoes on?
And go to grandma's house?
You know you filmed something good
when you have to sit down and replay
it for the whole family to see.
I was like, that's out of a movie.
(laughter)
washing our hands so no one
gets horrible tummy upsets.
- Yeah, everyone's in line
washing hands before we eat, huh?
- Cookies for Santa, me.
- Cookies for Santa, no!
Cookies for me!
- At first, when you like get together
and everyone's like good
and then you go home like,
everyone's sick.
I'm like, please don't get sick.
- Everyone wash your hands so we
can have a really enjoyable time, okay?
Has anyone seen Calvin?
Calvin, where are you, bud?
Have you guys seen
Calvin, is he over here?
Disappeared...
Huh, I wonder where Calvin is?
He might be getting his hands washed.
Ellie, is Calvin over there?
- No!
- He's not?
Huh...
Calvin might be outside,
I'm not sure where he is.
There you are!
Hiding under the table.
Yeah, silly boy.
- These kids are not eating, they
just wanna stay by the presents.
Don't open them, okay?
- Okay.
- Don't open them yet.
- Oh no, oh no.
Dog pile on Chad.
Oh, and it's crashed.
- Julia's in charge of the
family Christmas party this year
and either everyone's
gonna love it or hate it.
- I think people are annoyed with us.
We have to like, put together a skit?
- I think everyone's wishes
are a little overwhelmed
just with Christmas but
I think it's really fun.
Some of us are going to be
doing a lip sync battle.
All the kids are gonna
watch and either be scarred,
scared or...
Crap their pants, I don't know.
Grandma and grandpa are going first.
Ours is pretty good.
- Ours is pretty dang good, guys.
- We have costumes, do

(screeching)

- That's so sweet...
- Really, I'm dying, I kinda want one.
- Is there anything on the inside?
- That is so cute!
- What's in it?
- Aw...
It's a picture of mum and dad.
- Yes...
- And we can put ours right there.
- Yes.
- For the kids or something.
- I love this!
- When the little girls
opened up their lockets,
Ellie was like, I want one of those.
I seriously want.
- She was referring to a little girl.
- Emily, what's yours like?
Cute!
- That's awesome.
- What's your knife look like?
- Like this.
- Cute, Landon, aw yeah!
Yeah!
Cute!
- Thank you mom and dad!
- Welcome.
- I like the chain, look
how thick that chain is.
- Yeah, I mean, the steel
on this, is just so pretty.
- Yeah, think about it for a minute.
- That's a big shelf.
- A lot of pictures to hang up.
- So is there 20 frames here?
- There is 21, but I need to go grab one.
A few more, to have just in case.
- It's a picture of all the grandkids.
Yay!
- We're out of the game though.
- They all look so good!
- Mommy!
- Yes, you look so smart.
- I think you look handsome, Boston.
So this is something that
Landon has been doing
to help Ellie's headaches.
Basically just taking her neck
and throwing it all over the place.
- When she starts twitching, it's normal.
- Any loud screams is normal
too, apparently, right?
Nice.
I heard that.
Ouch.
Oh yeah, I gotta find the outside.
- The last three times
Landon has done this,
my headache is instantly gone away
but I instantly feel sick so,
it releases all that crap.
- But the headache being gone, is so nice.
- I'm gonna get a hold
of a chiropractor and...
I have them see me once a week.
- No big deal, just grabbing
a hold of the shoulder blade.
- Yeah, I don't blame you.
This is more for my rock
climbing figures side of things.
- This is one of my favorite parts
but most stressful parts
about getting together
for the holidays is making sure
all of these kids are
situated and fed and everyone
is doing a good job at eating,
not making any, too many messes.
We've got some delicious food,
Julie made this raspberry pretzel
cream thing that looks delicious.
- It's going fast, the
adults better get in.
- We've got some pumpkin pie
and then we're gonna have
some root beer floats, we got some like,
candy and all that good stuff.
And this entire evening, we've been having
the wonderful music of Kevin himself.
Tickle those ivories, man.
- I am not gonna let a week go by
without me calling Landon in.
- Okay, yeah.
- Cause every time I see Landon, I do that
and it does feel so good and I know
that's what I need to do, it's like,
go to a chiropractor, do
acupuncture, something.
- You know what I need to do?
- What?
- I need you to give me
a bite of your desert.
- Okay, I'm feeling my neck right now.
There's just a spot that's just
always more tight and tender, it hurts
so bad, so, thank you Landon.
- He's a miracle worker.
- But it's amazing how like,
sick you get right away
when it's done cause it
just releases everything
and you're just like...
Okay, here you go, I just gave you
a little bite cause I really like it.
Aw!
(laughter)
look at his face.
- Okay, here we go.
- After Kate's turn, it's my turn!
- Oh my gosh, put it in there, Kate.
Get it in there!
- After her turn, it's my turn!
- That's cute.
Cal's putting his hand in there.
- He's like, I want to make
peace by shaking her hand.
(laughter)
you see him shake?
Yeah, Calvin go!
Aw...
- No one's ever been able to beat mom
in an arm wrestle, even dad.
- I think Bo's gonna win cause
he has this hidden strength
that just comes out of nowhere.
- Champion stays and then Jared goes.
- And we work our way in,
so I will be the final one.
- Get set, go!
Oh...
Wow!
- Ah, she's putting up a fight!
- Mom's coaching him.
- And look at your
fingernails, they're filthy,
when's the last time you
changed your underwear?
- Okay, you go.
You go!
- Mom is the odds.
- Slam it down, Bo, come on.
Well, that's your mother.
Yay!
- That was a fight, mom!
- That was a good fight.
- Good job Bo.
- Now that grandma's tired out,
Chad will go up against her.
- Jared, go against Bo.
- But I am not saying that I will win.
- Okay go.
Bo is a lot like Griffis.
He's really small, but he packs a punch.
Come on.
- Hidden strength that no one knows about.
I am going to embarrass myself.
- No, you're not, you're good.
- Oh!
- Stop curling your arm, you cheater!
- On your mark...
- Wait, wait.
- Get set.
Go!
See, his arm curls automatically, look.
Jared's like body's lifted
off the ground, so is Joe's.
- Joe, come on, honey, right now.
Oh my gosh!
- I wanna go get ice cream.
- I don't wanna use my body weight!
- Why is Joe smiling?
- Why's your shoulder on my hand.
- I don't wanna use my
body weight, I'm sorry.
- Use your body weight, Joe!
Get your shoulder in there, Joe!
- I think the girls should
go against each other.
- He's got Donald Trump hands.
(laughter)
- Joe beat him!
- Alright, this is extended
over to the ladies.
Ellie!
(barking)
Bonnie has taken the form of a poodle!
- I just got Ellie back in line.
- On your mark.
- Hold on, I gotta focus for a second.
- Right, focus up, come on.
- She will probably win me.
- No.
- I've worked out before.
- On your mark!
Get set!
Wrestle!
- Oh my gosh!
That's my wife!
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah!
That's my wife!
She's the pitbull, ladies and gentlemen!
Alright ladies, Ellie's
climbing up the ladder,
this is for seniority.
- On your mark.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, are you good?
- Three, two, one, go.
- Oh!
Get it, get it girl!
Oh!
No!
Oh!
Oh no!
- She curled it!
- What!
- Wrist position does not matter!
Wrist position does not matter!
This is the final battle!
On your mark, get set, wrestle!
- Ah, she's pretty strong.
- Yeah!
Uh oh, mom versus Ruby!
- Can I go with grandma?
- I don't even wanna arm wrestle mom.
On your mark...
Are you guys ready?
On your mark, get set, go!
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, Ruby!
- Just give it to me!
- What are you waiting for!
What are you waiting for!
- Oh my gosh!
- Wow!
We'll work on the bark, mom.
So, we had a picture about four years ago
of these girls with their babies
and we're recreating
our picture right now.
So you have to hold the babies
exactly how you did before, okay?
- Jackson was in me, so
this is gonna take a minute.
- One!
- Cheese!
- Who is that?
Is that grandpa?
Can you close it?
Do you love that?
He has already come over
to me a hundred times
and has grabbed this and looked at it.
Are you tired?
- Nope.
- Should we go home?
- Nope.
- You wanna play?
Do you wanna go play?
- Yeah!
- Bonnie wants to try and be
too sexy for the holidays.
It's hard to be sexy, huh?
- Jared, I want you to spend more
time taking my pictures next time too.
- I try to, but you're like, I'm done!
I'm done, I'm done taking
pictures with you, Jared!
I like taking pictures of Bonnie because
she likes me taking pictures for her!
- That looks like I'm too
sexy for the holidays.
- That'll work.
- Collin's had a little too
much eggnog in this picture.
Before we all take off
tonight, we just want to wish
from our family to yours...
-  Merry Christmas!
- There you go!
- Is your lens...
- What about like, (speaks
in foreign language)
- Yeah!
(speaks in foreign language)
(heartwarming festive music)
