- He goes a tiny bit,
but he gets so excited,
and then he stops.
- Hi.
-  Snowstorm is coming in!
- This is such good packing snow!
Soon as we got home from
church, we knew exactly what
we were gonna do.
We were gonna get a lot of stuff done.
- Scratch that.
- Woohoo!
- Nice!
We got Zuma!
- Yeah.
- We just opened up another
space for the advent calendar,
and the kids got Chase.
We missed a day, so they got to open two.
-  We got Chase.
- Don't open that one yet.
You did, and, tonight,
we are going to read.
We are gonna start this.
I saw this at the bookstore the other day.
It's a little book, and
you read it every night,
and it comes with a little lamb,
and every night you read some scripture,
so it has scriptures or things you can do,
and that's what we're gonna start tonight
is we're gonna read that,
which I'm very excited about.
We also got a really My First
Christmas Story for the kids,
and it talks all about Jesus's story.
That's what we're gonna
read tonight as well.
Did you have fun with your cousins?
- Yeah.
- I had so much fun.
What's fun is when you do something
that you totally didn't plan.
Julie didn't plan on staying two nights,
and then it just happened to be the case,
and it was really fun,
and something special
that I saw this morning
when I was making the bed
was that little dog up there.
I made the bed.
I was like, "Oh, thanks
Calvin for your little gift".
- No, wawa!
- We need water.
-  Oh, you need
the water to play this.
-  No, no Zuma loves water.
-  K, there you go.
- We need to dive in.
Come on, dive.
- Hi.
(mocks snoring)
-  Calvin, come here.
- Oh, yeah.
(shouting)
-  Where's your snack?
- Somewhere.
-  Show me. Where is it?
Where is it?
(baby talking)
Is it up there?
-  Yeah.
- K, what snack are you gonna get?
I feel it.
I can feel it.
K, oh, usually I give you three.
You got four little baby M&Ms.
Good job.
Good job.
K, it is sinking in today on day three.
Yesterday wasn't as
consistent, because we had lots
of family in town, but he is
doing well with the potty.
Like I said, today is sinking in.
He loves to go, and he's
excited to sit on the potty,
and he goes a tiny bit,
but he gets so excited,
and then he stops.
He goes potty lots of times
but just a little bit,
because then he stops,
'cause he's excited.
Hopefully, by today really
just focusing on the bathroom
with me and him, he will get it down,
and maybe even tomorrow he'll go lots more
instead of little bits, huh?
- No pee.
-  No pee? (laughs)
- No pee!
-  Did you go pee all gone?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- No pee.
-  Well, good
job. I'm proud of you.
- Yeah.
(toilet flushing)
- Good job.
Guys, it is starting.
This is an official, official snowstorm.
It's coming in!
Look at the snow, and daddy
just walked through the door.
Do you wanna tell him?
- Cal, it's snowing!
- It's snowing outside!
-  Hi.
- Look at it!
-  I know.
- Oh my gosh, I'm slipping
all over the place.
- I wanna go outside.
-  Calvin, tell daddy what you did.
Calvin did not have one accident.
- That's amazing!
- While Jared was gone.
It's been, like, five hours, all day.
He had an accident this morning,
and then he hasn't had
one since, and, just now,
like right when you walked in the door,
he started a little tiny
bit in his underwear,
and I said, "Let's hurry, let's hurry,"
and we ran to the bathroom,
and he peed in the toilet.
- Good job, my little buddy, good job.
I just gave him a big hug,
and he's like, "Oh, wet,"
'cause of the snow.
Look at it.
-  Did you guys
have a good day at church?
-  Yes.
-  Was it fun?
- I wanna go outside.
- I do too. Look at it.
Here we go.
Are you excited?
Here we go.
Are you excited?
We're gonna go play in the snow, yeah.
(upbeat music)
(mumbles)
(upbeat music)
- Ready to go outside?
-  Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- Yeah, give me high five.
(upbeat music)
(laughs)
This is such good packing snow!
(upbeat music)
-  Let's see how fast you go.
(laughs)
K, go.
-  Ready, set, go!
(laughs)
(distant shouting)
Ready, set, go!
(laughs)
-  I'm gonna do it again.
-  Yeah.
-  It is December, baby.
- I love it, I love it.
(laughs)
-  You're gonna learn real quick
to keep those gloves on, mister.
-  Yeah, don't take 'em off.
-  Calvin has gone
through two pair of snow gloves.
- Woohoo!
(laughs)
-  It's fast, huh?
- Yeah, it's fast.
- I need to run inside and
grab some hot chocolate.
The one time I really
want to have a Razor,
but a covered Razor, is
so that the kids and Jared
and I can drive to Bonnie's,
like just all pile in,
'cause it's street approved,
and she's not very far
down the road, so we won't
take a four-wheeler right now,
'cause it's cold.
Maybe we will take a four-wheeler.
It's not that cold.
Jared, maybe we should
take the four-wheeler.
-  That's a great idea!
(laughs)
- Okay, we might take the
four-wheeler and go to Bonnie's,
but, some time in the future,
it would be really fun
to get a covered Razor
for really freezing days
where we wanna go back and forth
and go play in her snow and
then them come over here.
That would be fun.
Let's go get some hot chocolate.
- We went to Bonnie's,
and we built a snowman!
Woo!
Ow, you guys are eating his buttons.
(laughs)
Are you done in the toilet?
- All right, it just kinda--
-  Just kinda happened, didn't it?
This is so fun.
Are you guys having a blast?
-  Yeah.
(laughs)
- I'm eating his eye.
- They're breaking the snowman.
- K, you guys can't have any fun
if you're breaking the snowman.
No fun until the pictures
are done, k? Jeepers.
-  Cal, he has my gloves off again.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, that was the first
real snow of the season.
Jackson, remember the
other day when it snowed
just a little bit, and you
went outside and played?
This is a real snow.
Did you guys have so much fun?
- It was a blast.
- Yes, it was, and I think
the best part about it:
we had a plan for the day.
We had our whole day planned out.
As soon as we got home from
church, we knew exactly what
we were gonna do.
We were gonna get a lot of stuff done.
- Scratch that.
- Scratch that.
It snowed.
That means we're gonna party in the snow.
We went over to Bonnie and Joel's,
and we played in the
snow and made a snowman.
(baby talking)
- And then we came home.
- And I ate the snow buttons.
-  Yes, you did,
'cause they were what?
- Oreos.
-  That's right.
- They're so yummy.
Yummy, yummy.
(laughs)
- I got you.
Don't run from me.
(laughs)
I literally said, "Jackson,
I'm gonna get Calvin
"to bed, and I need you
to be a good boy and play,
"and, when I'm done putting him to bed,
"I'll put you to bed," and you, stinker,
slid down the hall stairs and ran.
(laughs)
-  He knows what's up.
-  Jackson, you hear me?
Please play good while
I get him to bed, okay?
Look, daddy's gonna work, and
I want you to be good, okay?
- Okay.
-  Bye bye!
- Sometimes we switch off
putting the kids to bed,
and sometimes daddy has a lot of work.
- Yep, got a lot of work this weekend,
and I'm getting a head start on it.
Goodnight, Calvin. I love you.
I'm proud of you for peeing in the toilet.
-  Goodnight.
-  Goodnight, goodnight.
-  Goodnight.
- Night.
