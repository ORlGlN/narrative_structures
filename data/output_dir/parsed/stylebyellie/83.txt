-  Why is the
cord in the baby's tummy?
- I've got an idea;
let's get paper towels!
It was heartbreaking.
It was exciting, and so much more.
- 14 weeks today.
I think I'm going to
do an update tomorrow.
- Oh, that's a great idea.
-  Oh.
What the?
- I don't know what is more
fun, setting up Christmas
or cleaning the house after Christmas.
I have been cleaning,
going room to room, while
the kids have been
playing, and running wild.
Hey, and Jackson just
asked me, do you remember
what you just asked me?
- I wanted to see the baby in your tummy.
- Oh, well, that was one thing.
I've been showing him my
app, of how big the baby is.
But I just walked by, and I went, 'Ohhh.'
And he went, 'How are you feeling, Mom?'
And I was like, 'I'm sick,
but thank you so much.'
He was so cute, to ask
me how I was feeling.
I've been cleaning, but
I've kind of been taking
a lot of breaks, because I really.
It's weird.
One day, you feel great,
like yesterday, I felt great.
Last night, I didn't feel well.
Woke up, definitely didn't feel well.
But today, I am 14 weeks,
and I showed Jackson,
this is what the baby looks lik.
This is the size of the baby.
I showed him all that.
This is how big the baby is.
- Where's the cord?
- The cord is right here.
- How is the cord in the baby's tummy?
- The cord is in the baby's belly button.
- Why?
- And then it hooks up to Mommy.
And that's how the baby gets food.
So when I eat, the baby
gets lots of nutrients.
Cool, huh?
Do you know that you used
to have an umbilical cord?
- Mm-hmm.
- And Daddy cut it when you were born?
- Mm-hmm.
- We have a video of it.
Cool, huh?
- And the app I use is the Bump.
I'm sure a lot of you
guys might ask, so, that,
let me see.
Yeah, the Bump.
I wanted to make sure
that I said that right.
But I just thought that
was really cute, he asked
how I was feeling.
But on to the next bathroom,
and lots of laundry.
Gotta get this one done,
and then I am done.
Then I'm done!
Wasn't too shabby.
When I was cleaning my
bathroom, though, I wanted
to go grab the camera
and show you guys, but
I couldn't find it, and
then I was in my groove.
But this is what I've been
using lately, for my tubs.
And it is, like, heaven
sent, because I don't feel
like I'm bending over as
much with the washcloths
scrubbing, I just really liked it.
I got it at a local
cleaning store, but I know
you can find some on
Amazon or like Google, like
handheld scrubbers, even
Walmart I'm sure would
have something like that,
but it's not very coarse,
but just enough to like
wash and scrub your tub.
My tub always needs to
be washed, because we use
tons of bath bombs and then
it, sometimes it leaves
like oil residue on the
edge, and then it colors
and sparkles, so we just
need to wash my tub lots,
because of that.
- Whoa! That was a lot of marbles.
Are you going to do it again?
(baby babbles)
Jackson, does it still
feel like Christmas?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You like playing with all your
Christmas toys, boys?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? Yeah, more!
Can you do it?
-  I can do it! I can do it!
- Let's see it.
Down it goes.
Yay!
- Let me do it.
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm not going to put
it in those little holes.
- Yeah, because you got these
big ones here, blocking it.
(laughs)
So Grandma and Grandpa
Meekem are coming over soon,
and we're going to show
them everything that we
got for Christmas.
Are you excited to show 'em?
What do you think you're
going to show them first?
- Uh.
- The Jack-in-the-Box?
(laughter)
Ready for this?
-  Yeah.
-  I don't know.
- A rock tumbler!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, my goodness! That will be so fun!
- Should we take a
little peek and see what
they look like?
- Uh-huh.
- OK.
- We should turn it on.
- One day left, so we gotta let it go for
one more day, OK?
-  Wow.
Let's see what they look like.
- I'm excited, because I
haven't seen it yet, either.
(children talking and making noise)
- Ew is right!
Uh, it was a bad idea,
let's get paper towels.
-  Oh! What the?
Don't drain down, down.
-  Look, I polished them a lot.
-  Wow.
-  It's finished!
- It softened them up quite a bit, huh?
You want to put them in there?
- Yeah.
- OK.
Drop them in.
Whoa.
(children giggling)
Wow, look at that.
-  I'm going to dry them up.
-  Look, this one has navy.
-  Wow, look at that, bud.
-  Hold this one.
-  Is that cool?
-  This one's finished.
- Almost.
-  You want to keep
that one out for this time?
- Yeah.
- Because, Jackson, we're
going to put them back in
the tumbler, with more
grit, to make them even
shinier, so let's keep
one rock out, and then
shine the rest up.
-  OK, let's try it.
- I have an app, and it
shows how big the baby is.
-  What do you want
Grandma and Grandpa to see?
-  The baby.
- Can we see pictures of it?
How?
- On my phone, it shows
how big the baby is, huh?
I guess if two o'clock
passes, and you have not
gotten ready, most likely,
you're not going to
get ready for the day,
so this is what I'm going
to be the rest of the
day, but I want to show
you guys what I'm doing.
I've been asking you guys,
I've been talking with
you guys a ton on Twitter,
and I've been telling
you, I've been so excited
to start bullet journaling,
and for Christmas, I got
Emily a ton of stuff for
her to do bullet journaling,
and I've watched a
bajillion videos, and a lot
of people like this brand
of notebooks, so I ordered her some stuff,
and me some stuff,
and I got some fun tape, I got some tabs,
just like everything I
need to start doing this
bullet journaling.
Usually, I really like Erin
Condryn, I like her planner.
This year, for 2017, I've
been using In the Leafy
Tree Tops Planner.
I like hers, because she
has a lot of different
types of styles, like if
you're Christian, she has
a bunch of other stuff, but
I just know that she has
one specific one, like if
you're Christian, it has
like lots of church stuff
in it, so I liked hers,
but a lot of times, those
planners, you don't utilize
every single page, and often
times, I have my planner,
but then I write on paper
all the time like our daily
to-do list, or what I
want to do, and I'm always
writing stuff down.
Hi, Mister.
I'm always writing
stuff down, and when you
guys had told me about
bullet journaling, I kind of
fell in love with it, so
I'm excited to start that
out, and I'm going to start it today.
It's Mama's crafts.
- What about these?
- Those are stickers.
- For me?
- For mom.
- Well, what about me, then?
- Well, I bet I could give
you some paper, and you
could help me, and you could have a few.
- But I want to help you.
- You can.
Would you like your own
paper, and to put some
stickers on, and to draw?
To stencil and make it
look cute and perfect?
- I just want paper and draw.
- OK, that sounds like a good idea.
Let's do that.
But I'm going to do that
so um I'll end up not
using a planner.
This is like, for, from
Erin Condryn, this is
for all our family's
addresses and phone numbers,
so I'll keep that.
I'm just kind of organizing my stuff.
This goes on the side of my bed.
And then this bag holds my
computer, and some notebook
stuff that always goes in
between my chair in my bedroom.
Tom is taking a nap, though,
so that is why I kind of
came in here.
And then, for Christmas,
I already show you this
hand lettering, got it
on Amazon, then I've been
working on that.
So I've been having fun,
and I'm excited for the
new year, and to write
down my plans, and goals,
and start those.
- What are these?
- That's tape.
- I want to do tape with you.
- What? You want to do all of it with me?
You just want to be my buddy?
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that sounds like a good idea to me.
Should we go color?
Get the stencils out, get tape out?
Go crazy?
- But this is tape.
(laugh)
- I just feel like today
has been one of those days.
If you know what I mean, you
probably know what I mean.
I've been in my office all
day, things have been a
little bit frustrating with
a few different things,
and so I was like, 'You
know what? I'm just going to
go outside with my dog, Penny,
grab a handful of treats,
and we're going to go
on a nice, long walk.'
I want to take Penny to a
place that she's only been
like one time, and it's right
next to where we usually
go in that park, but it's
up the mountain, and I think
we're going to go up and
see how far we can go on
the mountain, because a
lot of people walk that
with their pets, and I
just want to see how Penny
likes it, because I know
she wants, she probably
wants to go on an adventure
just as much as I do.
Yes, I think Penny knows
exactly what we're up to.
Let's go, let's go, come on!
Don't just go jumping around, let's go.
That's the goal, right up
there, get to the top of that.
Ready? Take a break.
Good girl!
Some of you guys have
been asking for updates
on Penny, and her training.
And what we've been doing
a lot of is the pulling.
That's one of the biggest
things that she has a
hard time with, because
she is so active, and
like trying to smell
things, especially if we
go to a new area, pulling
is a hard thing for her.
So, with those treats, I do
the same thing that I did
when I was walking with her on the fence.
We don't go if she's pulling.
As soon as she lets up,
it comes back to me,
we walk a little bit
further, she gets rewarded,
and then, if she pulls
again, we stop, and we
just repeat that process
over and over again.
After we've done that for a little while,
we'll take her out, let her
go out on a little break.
She's always right next to
me within, like, 20 or 30
yards, she comes when she's
called most of the time.
Let's give it a shot.
Penny, come.
Good girl! Good girl!
Yeah, things have been going pretty well.
She's still a puppy.
She's only one, and so this
is going to be a long process,
and I'm excited to be
working on things with her,
especially as we get out,
into this beautiful open area.
She wants to explore, she
wants to go, and have fun.
I do, too, but there are
some rules we have to follow
along with that.
Well, she does.
I guess I do, too.
This is like, public property,
so gotta follow some rules.
Oh man, I tell you what.
That is beautiful.
Look at this valley.
It is just gorgeous.
I am out of breath.
Penny, are you having fun?
(laughter)
She's sliding down the hill.
Ah, look at that.
Utah has some of the most
beautiful sunsets I have ever
seen in my entire life.
By hitting those mountains,
they do a great job
of just casting this
beautiful orange and purple
skyline.
It's beautiful.
My hips are burning.
Oh my goodness.
I have no idea how this
is going to effect me
when I'm older, but I guess
I just gotta keep moving.
That's the thing. That's the key.
Just gotta keep moving.
Keep those hip flexors
engaged, keep rolling.
But not down the hill,
that would be really bad.
(music playing)
Uh-oh. I am smelling skunk.
Really, really strong.
That is not a good thing to
have, up in the mountains.
Especially with your dog.
Because spraying is a
thing, especially up here.
We made it to the top, guys.
Obviously, there are other
mountains, but this is
where it's flat.
Check out that sunset.
It's beautiful.
Woo, made it to the top.
There's another mountain back there.
This is gorgeous.
Glad I did it.
Penny, are you glad we did this? Huh?
Yeah. Yeah.
You like the snow?
I'm sorry, guys, but I
just cannot get over that.
It's amazing, and I think
it's actually really
good timing, to be up
here to talk about this.
Ellie and I sat down
today and we talked about
our New Year's goals.
And we have a video that
we're going to be talking
about that, and we're
actually asking you guys some
questions, so stay tuned for that.
But it's just nice to be
up here, in the mountains,
by myself, with my dog
Penny, and just reflecting
on the year, and what we
were able to accomplish.
Some of them were our
goals that we set out.
Some of them weren't goals,
but we did them anyway,
and some of them were
things that we're excited
to get going on in 2018.
I loved 2017. It was
busy, it was fun, it was
heartbreaking, it was
exciting, and so much more.
And I'm glad that we had
the opportunity to share
the ups and downs with
you, and I can't wait to do
that in 2018 with you guys as well.
What I'd like to know from
you, and we'll probably
ask this a couple of times,
but what are your goals
for 2018, whether they're big or small?
What would you like to
do, what would you like to
accomplish in 2018?
2018 is going to be a
big year for us, and I'm
excited for it.
OK, Penny, should we get going home?
Let's go.
Well, this is kind of a sad site to see.
It's over. It's done.
Everything is back in its
proper place, and that feeling
of coming out and just
playing with your toys
is no longer here, so it's
kind of sad right now,
you know?
Like we're getting back to reality.
It's all over, Ellie.
It's over!
At least, until next
week, when we celebrate
New Years, right?
- Um, the kids will still
love waking up and playing
with their stuff.
- Yeah, it's just not
all in the living room.
- I know.
- On display for the kids.
- I know.
And waking up, and not caring
if crumbs are everywhere.
- Yeah.
- Like today, I cleaned the
kitchen and I went, 'OK,
keep it clean!'
- Oh, and I do have to say.
Ellie has been cleaning
all day today, so thank you
for doing that, while I
was working and taking care
of Penny and all that.
- You're welcome.
- You took care of the kids,
and you cleaned all day.
All day.
- I think the kids actually
liked it, because they
kind of just ran wild.
Like I don't know how
Jackson knew how to turn
Jared's little game on.
- Oh, my gosh!
OK, so I get home from
running errands, and Jackson
is playing the Nintendo
Switch, and Ellie's like,
'I didn't give it to him.'
- I did not.
- He is playing Mario Kart, and racing.
I don't know how he did that.
And then, later, I saw
him sitting on his little
sleeping bag here, with
the Apple TV remote, and
he's like, 'Oh, I'm just
picking a show, Dad.'
I'm like, 'Jackson, you're
three years old! Stop it!
Stop educating yourself
with this technology.'
- And that, my friends,
is Jackson running wild.
While I cleaned.
- Yeah.
- I think it's funny.
- It is funny. It's hilarious.
- He's actually four.
- Next week.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.
- What should we get him
for his birthday, guys?
- He's a four-year-old.
What should we get him?
I mean, he has rocks.
What more could he ask for?
- Um, but really though,
you guys kind of saw what
he got from Santa, but is
there anything that you
think a four-year-old,
or that you think Jackson
may like?
Please let me know, because
I think it would be fun
to, I don't know what to
do about his birthday.
We'll just be, like,
low-key here at the house,
but I want him to have
something special, you know?
- Yeah. Let us know in
the comments down below.
So that's it.
Christmas is kind of over,
and it's kind of sad,
but New Year's is going
to be a lot of fun.
I'm really excited about
2018 in general, but
specifically the New Year's.
- Because that's always fun.
- Yeah, it's going to be great.
(cheering)
Speaking of treats, we've got grapes.
Pay no mind to the Doritos,
we've got the healthy
grapes right here that
we're eating, and we are
going to end the night per
our usual, watching a show.
So thank you guys so much for watching.
Thank you for sticking around with us.
This entire year, we
appreciate you, and we are
grateful for you.
Have a wonderful day, and
we will see you tomorrow.
- How many more months til baby comes?
- Six months, yeah, six months,
because today's the 28th.
- Six months.
(groaning)
Six months.
- Six months til baby.
- 14 weeks today, I
think I'm going to do an
update tomorrow.
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Depending on how I feel.
- Baby update.
- Because, as you can tell,
today was cleaning day.
- I think you look clean and beautiful.
- Thank you.
- You always do.
OK, this time it's for real.
- OK, bye bye!
Go away.
I want to watch the show.
- Say good night, Kevin.
- Night.
