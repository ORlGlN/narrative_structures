- Good morning!
- Good morning!
- So Ellie is out with her
family today, and we are
going to be meeting up with her soon.
But before we do that, we
thought it would be fun to
do something exciting with her and us.
So today what we are going
to do is the husband and kids
buy my clothes challenge.
So Jackson what that means
is we're going to go to
the store, we're going to
pick out some clothes for mom,
we're going to have her try
them on and see what she thinks.
Now for me, I'm thinking we
do some crazy clothes, we do
some pretty clothes, we
do some beautiful clothes
just whatever we find that
we like, we're going to get
for her and have her try it on.
Does that sound good?
- Yeah.
- So I've got some dollars
here just for you, that we're
going to take and we're going
to go get mom some stuff.
Sound good?
- Yeah.
- Calvin did not want to be
here for this clip right now
but he will be joining us
as well, and he's going to
pick out some clothes
for his mom too, okay?
- Let's go get those clothes,
we'll meet up with mom
and we'll see what she thinks.
- Okay.
- High five. Boop!
- Dalalala!
- Dalalala!
- So we drove down to the
mall and I feel like we're
already starting at a disadvantage.
The mall that we're going to,
about half the stores inside
of it are closed and I'm not
even sure if they're popular
stores but, we're going
to work with what we have
and we'll find some good stuff.
I'm going to grab the kids out of the car,
and we'll get this going.
Don't worry, we'll find
some good stuff in there.
Alright boys, we made it,
what's our goal Jackson?
- Clothes.
- Clothes for mom, so I want
you to pick out something for
mom, I want you to pick
out something for mom.
Put those eyebrows away, you're not upset.
They're a little tired
from the long drive.
Calvin, you pick out something
for mom, you pick out
something for mom, and I'll
pick out something for mom.
Got it?
- Yeah, got it!
- Okay, let's go!
(cheerful music)
- Oh, pretty!
-  What is, that right there?
You think that's pretty for mom?
This right there?
- Yes!
-  Is that what
you want to get mom?
- Yeah!
-  Okay, let's see
if they have her size.
You know, I think this is
stuff for, like, grandma.
Let me look at the price tag
(gasps)
I think we'll look somewhere else!
- Purple!
- That is purple!
Which one, that's the one
you want to get for mom?
- Yeah!
-  Okay, let's see
if they have her size.
And tell me why you like this.
- Because I like it for mom.
-  You do?
Do you like it 'cause
it's pretty, do you think
mom will like it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, alright, that's one.
That shirt doesn't have
any sleeves so we've gotta
find something to go over
it to cover her shoulders
does that sound good?
Can you help me find like a
coat or something to go with it?
- Mommy store.
-  Yeah, we gotta
get something for mom, okay?
- Store
-  Yeah, at the store.
Can you pick out something for mom?
Wait, you wanna put this one back?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
So I learned a couple things
while shopping with the kids is
when they're picking something
for their mom, they'll pick
one thing and put it back, then
they'll pick another thing,
and then put it back.
So we've gone through about
five different outfits with
the kids and whatever we
leave with is what we'll take.
- (mumbles)
- Yeah
Okay, I just think I found
the secret to success.
They have a Bohme.
It's right there, I think I'm
going to find a winner there.
So these shoes you want for mom?
- Yeah, they're so magical.
-  They're magical?
(laughs)
Okay oh no, we gotta get the
box, we gotta get the box.
Put those ones back, those
are just for display.
We gotta find the box, okay.
Okay, so this is what we
ended up with, I'm just gonna
tell you the stores that we picked from.
The kids did everything on
their own I didn't help them,
they picked everything out.
So we got Head Over Heels,
Pacsun, and the Bohme.
I hope she likes that we'll find out.
Okay, so--
- It's like we're one big happy family.
- Yes it is like we're
one big because we are!
(laughs)
- No!
(Ellie laughs loudly)
- Oh, what do you mean by that Calvin?
So Ellie has no idea what
we did yesterday, in fact
this is the first time
that she knows about
this video at all.
- Can you get that
mummy for me?
- We'll get that mummy in just a second.
- I do know that you went somewhere
- Yes
- and maybe
got something because
Jackson started and you
said "oh, don't say anything yet".
- Jackson do you want to
tell mommy where we went
and what we got yesterday?
- I got new clothes for you.
- What?
- Yeah, we got new clothes for you.
So today we are doing the
husband and kids buy my
clothes challenge.
- Jackson!
Was that boring or fun?
- Boring.
(Jared laughs)
- Did you pick out the
clothes for mom or did dad?
- So we each picked out one outfit.
I picked out an outfit,
- What!?
- Jackson did, and even Calvin.
- This is very exciting, I'm
glad this challenge exists!
Thank you.
- So we are going to start
with, who do you want to
start with first let's put
it up to you, do you want to
start with mine, Jackson's,
or Calvin's?
- Let's start with yours Jackson
you sound like you had fun.
It was a little boring but
fun 'cause you got a prize
at the end, huh?
- You guys stay right
here I'll go grab 'em.
- What, this is crazy!
I feel very spoiled like
my three boys over there
grabbing stuff.
So tell me how it went,
them picking it out.
Did they really pick it out?
- Okay, so
- They really picked it out.
I helped direct them, I said "Jackson we
need pants
- Even shoes!?
- "We need shirt" and he
wanted shoes, he picked out the
shoes specifically.
(Ellie laughs)
And I didn't help them
at all other than saying
"we need these items" and
then he picked out which ones.
(gasps)
- Oh, cute he's holding
the box up in front of me
with the shoes.
- Mommy do you see that?
- Yes.
- You're gonna die
- So he picked em out?
(gasps)
(Jared laughs)
That looks like the nail
polish I wore when I was 12!
Those are...
Wow!
- Want to try them on?
- Sure, I would love to!
- So that's what you have to
do is you have to go into the
other room and try these on
- Okay!
- And model them for us.
- I mean those are eye catching
and unique but, in a way
they're kind of really cute, I mean.
- I feel like it's something
Elton John or Michael Jackson
would wear.
- Try them on.
- Okay.
- Okay, so show us
(laughs loudly)
Show us what you got here.
(Ellie squeals)
- Well first, the pants are cute.
- I can put em on too.
- Aw and I need some pants, thank you.
He's trying on the shoes right now.
- He picked out the size too so
I hope it's okay.
- I hope you filmed that
- That's cute did you?
- I did as much as I could, I had two
kids by myself in the mall.
- Aw and he picked
out this shirt?
Jackson, and that matches so cute.
Jackson okay.
- Okay go try them on.
(Ellie squeals)
-  Jared, this is so fun
are you kidding me!
Are you kidding me!
They're actually so cute!
- That actually looks really good!
- I'm not even kidding you
I can't smack the smile off
my face 'cause I think it's--
Jackson!
- We have to show these
shoes off!
- That Jackson picked these out!
(Jared laughs)
Jackson!
I think they're cute!
I'm gonna wear them!
- Is that fun?
- Is that cool?
- Yes!
- I like the pants a lot!
- Do you like the shoes?
- Yeah and the shoes are like they're fun.
- They're a little interesting
but I actually think
they're cute.
- This shirt is really nice
on you the fit is so good.
- Thanks!
- I'm kind of nervous for my outfit now.
- Jackson, thank you.
Are you kidding me!?
These could be the
nicest pants
- You like them
I've ever owned I mean
they are stretchy and comfy
where did he find them?
- Head Over Heels, I think is where?
- It's cute!
(Ellie laughs)
The shoes are so different
but I actually think
they're so cute!
I would never pick those out!
I'm gonna wear 'em!
This is the cutest video Jared, thank you!
- This is Calvin's pick.
- And how did that work?
- Same exact way I took him
over to the bottoms and I said
"pick one" and he picked one.
And I took him to the tops
and I told him to pick one
and he picked one.
(Ellie laughs)
That's all.
- Oh, thank you.
Interesting color, I see.
(Ellie giggles)
Oh, it's a skirt!
- It's a skirt.
(Ellie laughs)
- Okay, it looks like it
would actually be really fun
for winter if I had a very
cool top, neutral top.
Can I see what else is in the bag?
- The receipt!
That's your top!
- Might want that!
(Ellie laughs)
- I was going to say you may
want to hold on to that buddy.
- Aw, that looks just like Momma,
that looks like me, flowers.
Okay I'm gonna try it on
- Okay go try it on
- Thanks Calverino!
Thank you baby you got
stuff on your hand you go
wipe them off.
Okay I'll try these on, this is cute.
- I'm ready for round two!
Oh baby!
(Jared laughs)
Ellie, that is so funny.
- What do you think?
- That is so funny.
(Ellie laughs)
Do you like any of them I
think the shirt's pretty cute.
- The shirt's okay for like
the lounge day with a sweater
I'd probably wear.
The skirt really isn't bad.
I probably wouldn't normally
pick such huge flowers, but
it's cute.
- Pretty good for a two year old.
- Pretty good for a cute
little two year old.
It's cute, thanks Calvin.
(Jared giggles)
He's so cute.
- That's so fun.
- My boys are good to me.
That was cute, Jackson.
This is really cute of you.
- It's kind of fun, huh?
- It's really cute that
the boys were involved.
- So here, this is my outfit.
(Ellie squeals)
Now I tried really hard, I
really tried and I wanted
to make it look good and
not something that you would
100% normally go to, I
kind of took what you
have been doing and maybe
pushed a little bit more.
So that's what I was going for here.
- Okay
- So let's start off with
this, just a light wash jean.
- Cute, cute.
Is that why you,
last night Jared came
home and he was like,
"What size pant are you?" I'm like.
(Jared laughs)
- I had to make sure but I
bought it before I checked.
- That's cute.
- Then I got this little jacket.
- That is so cute and so soft.
- And this shirt, blouse?
(gasps)
- Oh, cute!
Yeah, a little different it
would be cute under that jacket.
- And then to top it all off
a hat.
- That's so
cute, I saw that and I
thought "oh my gosh!"
- I'm nervous to see what
(Ellie squeals)
it looks like all together so
go ahead and give it a shot.
- Thanks!
- You ready?
- Yep!
- Bring it on out.
You have to tell me what you think.
What do you think?
Get a little closer!
- I love
the hat,
the pants are cute and loung-ey.
- Yeah.
- And I really like the top,
I might pair it differently
when I wear it but
- Okay tell me what you
would pair it with.
- I love all the pieces.
- Parrot.
- I don't know maybe people can tell me.
I like the hat--
- I think it's stinking cute--
- No!
I think it's cute I'm wondering
how it's all put together.
- Yeah.
- What do you think?
- Well you know I always
think you look like
a million bucks.
- What do you think though,
putting it together?
- I really like it.
- Do you think it all matches?
- I think it totally does.
- Okay!
- If I saw you walking
down the street
- Really!?
- I'd be like "hey girl, hey!"
I really would.
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- I like that they're not like so tight.
- Thank you yes, I do like
the pants and I normally would
not find or wear pants that like these.
They're not just skinny fit
- Yeah.
- it's just kind of a little more loose.
- How'd I do?
- You did great, I love the
hat, I'm just only wondering
if the
- Yeah, if there's something
else that you could do it
- if the jacket matches the
shirt and the hat I wonder.
- And that was my biggest
concern is because they didn't
have a lot of different color
hats, and I didn't think
I wanted to know if they
gray and the tan would clash.
They had a black hat, and I
was like "that's too close
to black".
- No, I love this hat.
- Yeah.
- I love it though, I love all
the pieces, I may wear it a
little differently though, together.
This was really cute.
(Jared laughs)
- Yeah, I--
- I'm being honest you wanted
me to be honest, right?
- I think it's a lot of--
yeah, oh 100%
- I'm not, okay.
- I don't want you to fabricate anything.
- No, no I love it.
- Good, I think it looks really
really good on you
- Thank you.
- I really do.
- This was so cute!
- I'm really happy with how
it turned out.
- Who won the best outfit?
- Calvin!
- Jackson,
Calvin or dad?
- Calvin did for sure.
(Ellie laughs)
Calvin's was freaking hilarious,
although Jackson's shoes
were really funny.
- I actually kind of like them.
- Okay, here's a better
question, what are you going
to take back?
We have the receipts for everything.
What are you going to take back?
- I like the shirt, I probably
would take the skirt back.
- The skirt back?
- That's probably what I wouldn't
wear anyway
- Is that the only thing
that you're going to take
back, you're going to keep
everything else?
- Yeah, I think I really
love this, totally.
Thank you.
- To me that is the biggest
success of them all.
- No, totally.
- Yeah.
- I love this, I mean
the pants are so cute.
This is what I think, because
you told me to be honest.
- Yes!
- I think that this is such a
nice shirt, and so I probably
would wear the shirt and the
hat together with a nicer
just like pair of pants,
but I love it all.
It is so, the shirt is cute
and this is something I would
pick out a while ago, but I
haven't picked out something
as fancy, you know, like the
lace and stuff in a while.
It's cute.
- So here's what I want to do,
let me know in the comments
down below if you think
these pants go good with this
outfit, or if you think Ellie should,
like she said, tighten it up
with something a little bit sleeker.
- Yeah.
- Let me know in the comments below.
- I love Jackson's,
that one is so
- That is so cute and simple
and beautiful.
- And so me.
- Yeah.
- And the pants were perfect
and I'm like, it takes me
forever to find pants,
bring a three year old.
- Well, it was so funny
because the entire time I was
shopping I was just, the first
thought in my head is like
"how do these ladies do it,
going to the mall with kids?"
I had a one seat stroller,
not the double stroller
so that made it harder.
But then just finding the
time to even go in and try
things on, I was getting a
little frustrated, so I have
to give you guys props
- Yeah, awww.
- But it was fun, we had a good
time and I made it fun with
the kids.
I just thought it would be fun
to do this for you and to see
your reaction to it.
- Well it was very fun, this
was so cute of you, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thoughtful too.
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.
- On the next video it's
going to be wife buys my
gaming console.
- No!
(laughs)
- But that's actually it for
the video, thank you guys
so much for watching, if you
enjoyed it give it a
- I'll buy you a game console
- big thumbs up okay I'll take it.
(Ellie laughs)
- One of these days we'll
do another round of this,
and we'll do the "husband
buys my makeup challenge"
'cause I'd love to go in
and do something there too.
- Jared is very sweet and
what I really enjoy about
our relationship is Jared
is into what I like.
I feel like I try to
reciprocate that as well.
- Absolutely
- Because, even though we
are into different things or
different hobbies or,
we like different things
I think that you're really
cute to try and learn
- Yeah
- what I like
- I wouldn't say
I wouldn't necessarily like
I'm into it, I would say
I listen when you
- Yeah.
- Are talking about
- Yeah.
- Those things, and I
make note of those things.
- Yeah, when I get frustrated
or whatever you're really
good to listen.
- Yeah.
- And then I feel like I'm that way too
- Absolutely
- When you are
trying to find the new pixel
XL camera or phone or I don't
even know what I'm saying
but, you know what I mean?
- Absolutely!
- So thank you.
- Hey, communication, listening.
- That was cute.
- This is fun.
- You're the best.
- Alright guys, we'll see you next time.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- That was cute.
(upbeat music)
