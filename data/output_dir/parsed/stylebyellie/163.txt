(Ellie laughs)
- I think it's funny.
- Good morning everyone.
Guess what?
Today I realized that it is October 14th,
and you know what that means?
Well you probably don't, but I do.
Today is the day, last year,
that Ellie and I moved into our house.
We have been in our house officially
for one full year.
Yeah!
Last year we came to the
house nearly every day
and we filmed some of the
big processes that they did
with the drone circling the house
so we could have a very special video
of the process of building it,
and that video's gonna come out
a little bit later today,
so stay tuned for that,
because it's gonna be
so cool and exciting.
But not only that, it is a special day
because of that anniversary,
but also because we're going to see
someone very special to us,
one of our IVF grant winners
is having a baby shower
and they invited us to come
and so we are so excited and thrilled
to be a part of that.
Also, we want to thank Emmelie and Kelsey
for watching the video
today and leaving a comment.
I just finished editing the video
and it's gonna be a big day,
so we gotta get started
and I'm already behind,
let's get going for the day.
Are you ready?
High five,
up high,
down low,
to the side,
too slow!
Give me a kiss.
I love you.
- Where's the Bingo?
- Oh, I think Grandma knows where it is.
-  Is it in here?
-  I think it's in there.
Go see.
I love you buddy.
- Bye.
- I am excited to see our friends
and I'm also excited to walk up and down
the baby sections looking for
an awesome gift for our friend.
We are going to Riley's baby shower.
She was one of the IVF grant winners.
But she also is our friend.
We have a really awesome
private message group,
between us and them,
that we're giving updates
and we talk and we cry.
And It's just, it has
been really fun getting
to know them a little bit better.
And
- With all the IVF grant winners.
- We're looking at some baby monitors.
Yes, I agree.
I think I want to get her a baby carrier,
because that was something
that was really fun
when I got,
- Oh yeah.
- but it's something
that's sometimes it's like
you don't have it right away,
'cause usually I wear a wrap with the baby
and then use a carrier later,
so I think she'll like that.
- Yeah, we loved having this
specific baby carrier, so.
- They have Tula's and
- Ergo's?
- Ergo's, those are two really nice ones,
and I really like the Tula's,
I feel like they're comfy on the baby,
because they come higher up,
like up on their necks so.
- This lady is wearing the same hat
as you are, just a different color.
- Twitter!
Seriously there are a few baby items
that I really like though on Amazon.
It's called Dohm, and it's like
a very light sound machine.
We used that for a long time with Calvin.
I just put it away like a week ago.
So the Dohm is really fun too,
just for nice sounds,
just a subtle sound for babies.
I really like that, as well.
If I was thinking, I should
have ordered her one,
'cause I think those are awesome to have.
(tender music)
Hi cute girls.
- Hi.
- How are you guys?
- Good.
Everyone's good, this is so fun.
- I love being with our little group.
-  Me too.
This is so cute.
- It's so cute.
- Look how cute that is.
Everything is organized
by books, baby books.
- Yeah, it's the baby books theme,
that's so fun and so cute.
-  Good idea.
It was your aunt?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so cute.
He's like, okay.
-  Thank you so much
for letting us hang out.
- Yeah, that's so much for coming.
- It was so fun to see you.
(laughing)
Our kids are hiding.
-  Boo!
-  Ahh!
Hi.
(gasps)
What is that?
- It's a mask.
-  It's a mask, it
is a transformer's mask?
- Yeah, watch it.
- Okay, whoa, you look so cool.
Hi Cal.
Well give me hugs.
Mmmm.
- Okay, they hid something for you too
in your room.
- Ooh.
- What did you hide Cal?
-  What did you guys hide?
- Close your eyes.
-  Close my eyes?
-  Yeah.
- Okay.
-  Don't see yet.
- Don't see yet.
- Open your eyes.
- Don't look.
- Oh, did you guys make this?
- We put a lot of stickers on it.
We put stickers on this side,
and all on the house
and stuff inside.
-  And inside?
- Yeah.
-  Jackson did you make that?
- Yeah.
-  Did you make that
with Grandma and Grandpa?
- I made it with,
it's for you and you.
-  Awww.
- It's for you and you.
- Awww.
Jackson, are there ghosts in there?
- Did you just make that out of like
- It was a box, yeah, I taped it.
-  Oh good, I'm glad
there's no ghosts in it.
- Just skeletons.
-  Just skeletons.
(laughing)
That's so fun.
Did you help too Calvin?
- Yeah.
- There's laughing
pumpkins, laughing pumpkins.
-  Yeah, Jackson this is so cool.
- Laughing pumpkins say
this, ha ha ha ha ha.
-  Is that a laughing pumpkin?
Cool, that's so fun.
You guys are cute, you know.
- It's your mom.
-  I know it's just her.
(laughing)
- I'm gonna try and scare
the neighborhood kids.
What are you doing?
(laughing)
I think it's funny.
I told you the other day
we always have neighborhood
kids coming over
asking to play with the Segways,
and the last two days,
we have had two new kids come to the door,
so now they all have to,
whoever gets to the door first
gets to play with the Segways so,
I think it's cute.
- Going to the baby shower today
was so exciting.
It was so enjoyable and it just made me
overwhelmed and filled with gratitude
that we had, even just
a small part to play
in this life changing experience
for Aaron and Riley.
- Hey,
- I want to say something too.
-  You do?
Well come on out and say it.
I'm talking about the baby shower.
- It's too cold.
-  Oh, should I come inside then?
It is pretty chilly.
I was just saying how wonderful
the baby shower was.
- Oh yeah, we cheered up.
- Yeah, absolutely and I think
one of the coolest thoughts,
the coolest things is we knew
that this family would be so grateful.
We knew that the experience
would be so great.
When Aaron and Riley
shared with us their video
telling their family
that they won the grant,
they were at a church party
and they had all of their
family and friends there,
and the whole church
uproared with excitement
and joy and laughter.
And it was just, it was so cool to see
and to have a small part of,
and I'm so excited for Aaron and Riley.
Congratulations guys,
this is gonna be so wonderful.
I mean it was just so fun to be there.
- Yeah, it was a special feeling.
We had a really good day.
- Yeah, it really was nice.
- Just talking.
- Trying to figure out
if we can do this again.
Jared's been on the phone and email,
well it's that time of year, you know,
it's right before the holidays.
And last year was a
little crazy in December,
and this year we've learned a lot.
I can't promise anything,
but we are trying to see if we can
get some sponsors,
and trying to see if we can do it,
and we're excited.
- Yeah, I mean we did it once,
but how cool would it be
- to it again.
- to do it again.
Like Ellie says, it was a big process,
and we've learned a lot
to do going forward.
But yeah, it's a big process,
and we had a lot of help last year
and I am so incredibly grateful
for everyone who helped last year.
They're a big part of our lives now.
So we're gonna try and do this again.
On a completely unrelated note, Ellie
- I'm still working on this stupid puzzle.
-  Well it doesn't
help that one of the kids,
when we had all the kids over.
- Oh totally
-  They had their fair
share of fun at the puzzle.
- Yeah, my kids too.
-  They demolished
what was the majority
of the puzzle that was completed,
so we're trying to put it back together.
When I edited the video of this,
-  Could you even tell?
- You could kinda tell,
but it is not as bad on the video
as it is in person.
Like I have a headache looking at it.
- Oh I know, like every piece you look at,
it's moving, like what the?
-  And the bigger
the pattern, the more it
-  Moves.
-  You can't even see it, but
- This puzzle moves.
Just believe us.
- Ellie and I have been in our house
for exactly one year.
One year ago today we moved into our place
and it has been the best year,
the craziest year, the
most exciting year ever.
And I'm glad you guys have
been along for the ride.
It's been so fun.
And I can't wait to see what happens next.
Most of you probably know that we filmed
the entire process of
us building the house.
And that video's gonna come
out a little bit later today,
the drone footage, circling the house,
every step of the process being built.
So stay tuned for that.
Make sure you thumbs up that video
and this one, and we will
see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
