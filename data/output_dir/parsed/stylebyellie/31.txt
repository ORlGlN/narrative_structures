- I can't believe this.
Run away!
- I can't believe the snow.
(laughing)
(gentle music)
- I'm sick.
-  Does your head hurt?
- Mmm-hmm.
-  Does your tummy hurt?
- No.
-  Just your head?
- I'm sorry bud.
-  You've been so clingy to Dad.
- I know I love it.
He follows me everywhere I go.
(Ellie laughs)
(laughing)
They're changing Mario's clothes
on the game, on Mario Odyssey.
-  Calvin just laid
his head down and fell asleep.
(Ellie laughs)
- Remember a couple days ago when I said,
gosh, I wish it would just
either snow or not snow.
I'm pretty sure the
snow's made up its mind.
You can probably tell from
the reflection in the window.
We have a crap ton of snow.
And I brought my tape measure out to see.
This is ridiculous.
Oh my gosh.
It was raining at about
eight o'clock this morning
and I think it started
snowing around nine o'clock,
it's two o'clock right now,
so it hasn't even been that long.
And we have the hot tub
storage right here, with snow.
And let's see, nine inches on the dot.
So more than an inch an hour
is what we've been getting with snow.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
I kinda love it, I kinda hate it.
I have a love hate relationship with snow,
but I'm gonna learn to love it right now.
Yes Mr. Four-Wheeler, it's
time we take you for a spin
and use you to the best of our abilities.
I love this thing.
This is the coolest attachment
for the four-wheeler,
is the plow.
It makes shoveling nine inches of snow
from the driveway, oh so much nicer.
Look at that, so much freaking snow.
(engine starting)
Thank goodness, woo.
I was nervous for a second.
Last time this happened,
it didn't start for a long long time.
(bright music)
Okay, I have to say this
is kind of ridiculous.
This amount of snowfall is crazy.
I just finished, and now
I need to start again.
See that?
That scrape right here?
I did that one minute ago.
That stuff, all through here,
that's was when I very first started.
Like oh my gosh, I have to start
all the way over again.
This is so much snow.
This is crazy.
Should we go skiing tomorrow?
That might be fun.
-  Alright guys, Penny's out.
Oh my goodness, we got a foot.
Look at her trot through that snow, wow.
It's all fresh snow
that she gets to run in for a minute.
Holy cow.
- This is awesome.
-  Crazy.
- It's crazy awesome.
Hey, well what do you think, huh?
What do you think of our robot?
What do you think, are you kinda scared?
Is that why you're
coming right next to me?
Don't worry Penny,
it's not gonna do anything.
It's just vacuuming.
Oh it's hiding from ya.
It's hiding from ya.
Oh she's hiding, she's hiding.
There it is.
(vacuum humming)
There it is Penny, go get it.
There it is, go get it.
(Jared laughs)
She has no idea what to do with it.
That's so funny.
There you go.
Oh watch out Penny, it's coming!
(louder humming)
(Jared laughs)
(Jared barking)
(Jared laughing)
- Did she get scared?
- I scared her.
I'm sorry, I'm such a mean dad.
Am I a mean dog dad Penny?
Woo, watch out!
-  Yeah it has little, Penny go.
-  It has little bristles.
-  She's trying to find the food
before the vacuum does.
-  It's a race,
who's gonna find it first?
Who's gonna clean it up first?
Penny's sniffing around the corner.
She's not finding it.
- I love my Valentine present.
Thank you Jared.
- You're welcome.
- Well it's for me too.
I didn't want to vacuum,
so I had the robot do it.
I can't believe this.
I know all we've talked about today
is being sick and the snow,
but this is incredible.
Look at all the snow.
You know what we're gonna do boys?
If you're feeling better tomorrow,
we are going to play all day in the snow.
- All day long?
-  All day long.
Does that sound fun?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Maybe we can put the
sled on the four-wheeler
and we can drive around on the sled
and all that good stuff.
It's almost like Christmas, isn't it?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, do you
like the snow Calvin?
- Yeah.
-  Should we play in it tomorrow
if you feel better?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(beeping)
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
It's a bomb, run away!
Are we safe?
Good.
Phew, that was a close one.
- I can't believe the snow.
-  I know, isn't that so crazy?
Look at how much snow is on the hot tub.
-  Whoa.
-  Whoa is right.
- I'm hungry.
-  Oh yay, you're hungry.
- I'm gonna get dinner, waa!
- Yes yes, wear your
energy thin, get tired.
Wear your energy out, it's almost bedtime.
Keep running my child, run!
- I'm gonna go watch TV waa!
(laughs)
- A parent's greatest dream come true.
When the kids wear
themselves out before bed.
T minus 15 minutes until
Jackson will be fast asleep.
6:51, let's time it.
Hit the clock.
30 minutes later, they are asleep.
It took about 30 minutes,
because we were reading stories
and I'm saying goodnight and everything
and then they went upstairs, fell asleep.
Honestly, I feel good
about the sleeping stuff.
You guys have heard this all before,
but I love the way that
we're doing things,
because it helps them and it helps Ellie,
especially while she's pregnant.
That is the biggest thing for her.
We had a hard time,
because Calvin and Jackson were coming up
in our bedroom in the middle of the night
and it would make us not sleep.
But now, they're sleeping
through the night,
Ellie's sleeping all the
way through the night,
except for a couple times
when she has to wake up
to go pee, because you
know, pregnancy stuff,
but it's good, I love going to bed now.
(laughs)
So I just took a peak at the video
that we uploaded today,
which is us talking about baby names
and Ellie, I'm so happy to
let you know that I think--
- Shark Dee Dee is the name?
-  I think we're gonna call
our baby Cody Shark Dee Dee.
- What about Cody Olivia
Boston Lincoln Shark Dee Dee?
Because that's Jackson's new name.
- That was Jackson's new name.
We were sitting down for dinner tonight
and Jackson was like I don't
like Cody Shark Dee Dee.
I like Cody Boston Olivia
Lincoln Dee Dee, Shark Dee Dee.
So I'm sorry guys, that's
gonna be the name officially.
Official, from us to
you, baby name reveal.
(laughs)
Can you believe it, like
where does he get this?
- He's crazy.
-  Where does he get Shark Dee Dee?
- He thinks it's cute.
He made it up and laughed.
- I guess, yeah.
-  That's the funniest thing.
- Ah, I'm getting flustered.
-  What are you
getting flustered with?
- I'm looking at places to
go with the kids and Penny
in our camper.
- Uh-huh.
-  Somewhere
where there's not a foot
and a half of snow outside?
- Somewhere where it's kind of warm,
but we don't want to go too far.
-  You know where I want to go?
- Where?
- I want to go someplace warm,
where the beer flows like wine
and the women instinctively flock
like the salmon of Capistrano.
Ellie, I'm talking about
a place called Aspen.
- Sounds too cold for me there.
- Yeah, well I heard the French are--
I'm sorry, I can't finish that quote.
- Goodbye.
(Jared laughs)
- I get on movie quotes
and Ellie doesn't like the movie quotes.
-  I do too,
I'm just thinking.
- Okay.
- You're just thinking.
-  Help me.
- Okay.
- I've texted you a thousand things.
- You have, that's true.
I've been playing video games,
so time to put the video games away
and time to help my pregnant wife.
Geez Jared, why haven't you been helping
your pregnant wife?
Come on, come outside.
Hey you, yeah you.
Have you been enjoying the snow?
Yeah, you've been enjoying the snow?
You ready for bed though?
Yeah, you're ready for bed.
She has been having tons of fun.
She has been running up and down the fence
with the neighbor dogs.
She has been pile driving her nose
into the snow and tunneling underneath it.
She is a lab through and through.
Well guys, that's it for us tonight.
Calvin, I hope you feel better.
Jackson, (snaps) you're doing great.
And Ellie, I don't
think she's been feeling
all that great too.
I think she's catching what they have too,
but we are going to take it easy
and get on the mend
over the next couple days,
so thank you guys for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up
and we will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
