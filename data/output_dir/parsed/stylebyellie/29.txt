- I know a lot of people
will not love this.
He was so mad.
- You look like you're in heaven.
I did not sleep last night.
Come with me, come with me.
I've got just the thing.
- This has been Penny for like 10 minutes.
I just let her out to go potty.
Don't look at me, keep going!
(laughs)
She's like, "Don't stare at me".
She loves this.
She just puts her face in
the snow and it's just like,
look at her!
(laughs)
What shall I do when Jared
and the kids are gone?
I can clean, I can make dinner.
I think I have the best idea.
The last chocolate chip cookie.
My favorite drink.
The best Valentine's Day present
Jared could ever have gotten me.
Seriously, if you're pregnant or
you want to get your
girlfriend or wife a gift,
this back massager is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.
Seriously, best gift ever.
Thank you, Jared.
This is amazing.
And I just ate like 100 Tootsie Rolls.
I'm pregnant, I can do what I want!
On a serious note guys, sit down.
We're gonna chat for a minute.
I want to give you a
little update about Penny,
about cleaning, and about vacuums,
another gift.
I know, Jared is a spoiler.
He spoils me.
But, he got me, and him and
us and the family and Penny,
a vacuum, a robot vacuum for the floor.
I didn't know what I thought
about it because I just didn't
know if it would really be any good.
And it's been the best thing ever.
He got us a Roomba and it is amazing.
And so because of that, I also ordered...
Well, I didn't know he was
getting me that, but I had
ordered, in this box, is just
a bunch of filter replacements
so you can see how like
disgusting this vacuum is.
I need to clean it out.
I just wanted to show
you guys like what I use
cause I have a lot of questions,
What do you use to keep your house
clean with Penny shedding?
Penny is a lab, and she
is inside quite a bit,
especially with the winter.
We love having her around,
upstairs, and she sheds a lot.
So, I usually vacuum every day.
So every day, just here on the hard wood,
I use this Dyson cordless vacuum.
So that's what I use
for the hardwood floors,
and then I also have
this mop I got on Amazon.
This is the bucket for it.
You just search like, Spin
Mop and this will come up.
So this is the mop head.
I just use water with
a little bit of vinegar
and sometimes I'll use a Bona cleaner,
but I found that this
works the best for me,
is just using a mop.
And I usually will mop once a week.
And then I actually even have
a Bona mop that just has a
little velcro pad that you
put on it, and that's when I
use the Bona cleaner.
I just spray Bona cleaner
down and kind of spot mop.
I really don't use that much.
It's usually just a good mop once a week
and a vacuum everyday.
So that's like what I have
and then for our main vacuum
for the floors for
downstairs, for the bedrooms,
we have another vacuum.
Another Dyson vacuum.
This is just, it's an Animal one and
we have used and abused it.
And I just got a bunch of
filter replacements for
all the vacuums.
Usually I will take the filters
out and I will wash them,
like you put it under water
and then you can wring it out.
And then you can even clean out in here.
Usually, I'll clean those once a month,
because it just gets really dirty
and really hairy with Penny.
And you can just see,
this was just a few uses
and it just is a lot of hair, and popcorn.
And then we just have lint rollers
and I use that for these, this is velvet.
You would think it
would attract more hair,
but it's really not bad.
I've been very impressed having Penny
and no one likes dog hair,
but we usually, when we take
her once every other month
to a cleaner, and she gets her
nails and she gets groomed,
like a really thorough cleaner.
We clean her here, but to
get a really good deep clean
we usually take her in
and have her get treated.
And when she goes in and gets
her treatments and her baths,
she gets, it's called a
Fur-minator treatment and she only
gets that every other time
she goes cause you don't need
to do that much.
It really cleans their undercoat
and it really helps her
shedding decrease a lot.
We've been doing that
just since she was little.
So, between getting her groomed often,
us grooming her ourselves often,
and then all of the vacuuming,
the cleaning and the hair
really has not been bad at all.
Obviously when the seasons
change, it gets different.
Like when winter came,
she was shedding tons
and getting her new thick coat.
And then in the spring she'll shed a ton
getting rid of that coat.
So, those are times when it's like crazy.
I can't even contain the hair.
But other than that, just
like on a regular basis,
she's really good.
So I just, while Jared and the
kids are gone for a minute,
I just really wanted to
sit down and just show you
the vacuums that we were using.
Just a little update with
Penny, like with that.
Just because we get so many questions.
So I hope I answered that for you.
And I love cleaning and vacuuming.
It sounds really crazy
going over how many we have.
It's like, "Do you really need that many?"
but that's nice to use,
like for thorough cleanings,
just day to day, when like
the kids spill, we just use
that little vacuum.
And then lately, every night,
Jared's been doing that
Roomba, and it's been awesome.
So honestly, now that we have that,
we probably won't use this as much.
But, I mean, we have it,
I'm going to totally use it.
But that was very nice of Jared,
because usually I vacuum every day
and since he got that for me,
the last like three days,
I haven't vacuumed at all.
Because he's just put the
Roomba on and it works so well.
I always clean out my filter
over on that big vacuum,
because we've had it for a year
but I haven't ever cleaned out
the filter on this one yet.
Thanks to YouTube, figured
out how to undo this bad boy.
But I just get it wet,
rinse all the grossness out,
wipe this down and then
I ordered new filters.
So Jackson just walked in
from school, and he said,
"I'm still four."
You are still four!
(gasps)
What is that?
-  Did they save
your Valentine stuff?
-  Aww.
- Saved me these.
-  Wow, Jackson was
sick on his Valentine's party.
(doorbell rings)
-  Someone's at the door!
- Door just rang.
10 bucks it's the
neighborhood kids wanting to
use the Segways.
-  Wow.
- I get my candy.
-  That's your special
candy from Valentine's Day.
-  I need to open it.
-  Wow, did he get
a Valentine's Day package?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Wow.
- I bet you if you asked
Jackson very very nice...
-  He might.
-  He might give you some.
-  You can't take
it though, you gotta ask.
-  Yeah, you gotta ask first.
-  I dropped one.
You can have M&M's.
-  No.
-  Oh, if you're not
happy with what you get,
you can't get it.
This is Jackson's, and he's sharing.
Cal, can you give him that one?
- That's mine.
- Kids, toddlers,
learning, sharing, giving.
We're all learning in this household, huh?
Jackson, that's cool, that
was so nice of your teacher
to save this for you.
-  I know, that's so cool.
- Even I got this.
-  Whoa, someone
went all out with the candy.
-  Even Mickey Mouse.
-  Wow.
- Minnie Mouse.
-  Should we see who it's from?
- Yeah.
-  Wow.
-  Jackson, that
was so nice of you.
-  We are just going
to eat candy on the floor.
- Sounds like my kind of day.
-  What do we say to Jackson?
He gave you three candies.
- Only got him two.
-  Oh, but he took three?
- Mm-hmm.
(Jared and Ellie laugh)
-  Say thank you.
- Thank you.
-  That was so nice of him.
He was so mad that he couldn't
have his dog in the tub.
He was so mad.
- He zonked in my arms.
-  Oh my gosh, our kids are tired.
- You know what's crazy?
-  What?
- My right hand and arm is asleep.
And it hurts, so bad, like needles.
-  Doesn't help that
you worked out this morning.
Goodnight, baby boy.
(laughs)
- That's a growl snore.
-  Goodnight, Jackson's in bed.
- Oh, good.
- So, while I was in the
bedroom, wrestling with Calvin,
trying to get him to sleep,
and not get his puppy in the bathtub,
Ellie texted me and she said,
"I think I'm going to crash.
"I did not sleep last night."
And I said, "Oh no, mama,
you can't be not sleeping,
"especially while you're pregnant."
So I think it's time
we take drastic times,
and put them to drastic measures.
No no no, drastic times
call for drastic measures.
Oh look, she is zonked
out on the couch already.
- I did just yell at Jared.
-  I've got something...
- Just like, why did I get mad?
-  Cause of light.
It's too bright.
- He turned the light on, he's like,
"I'm gonna film a couple,"
and I'm like, "No!"
-  "No!"
Okay, come with me.
- Just cause it hurts my eyes.
-  Come with me, come with me,
I've got just the thing.
Yes, this is the time to do it.
What about this light?
Is this light okay?
It's a little bright.
Here, okay, hold on, here we go.
Okay, underneath this bed, here,
hold our friends, hold our
friends, hold our friends.
-  Get her out.
- ♪ Dun, da da dun dun dun dun ♪
Probably the greatest
pregnancy related item ever,
it's under our bed, for safe keeping.
(Ellie laughs)
-  So Jared doesn't trip on it.
(gasps)
Yes!
Open that up.
Bonnie stored it for me
forever, thank Bon, in that bag.
Pregnancy pillow!
No seriously, I did not sleep.
I dunno if it was like, a little insomnia,
like I just was awake and I was like,
"Oh my gosh, go to bed."
Because we had to wake
up super early today.
We've been filming all
morning, not for vlog, but...
Yes, I cannot even wait.
- Here's the thing, I have mixed feelings
about these pregnancy pillows.
-  It stinks cause
then we can't cuddle.
- We can't cuddle.
I end up cuddling with
this inanimate object
who is not my wife, or trying to anyway,
and then you're all wrapped up in this
all like, cuddled up like a cloud.
- It is true, like I'm in my own space
when we use these.
Okay, do you guys, when you sleep,
do you cuddle with your spouse,
or do you like, need your own space?
- This is just Ellie and me.
This is us, this is us.
-  Our butts touch.
- Our butts touch, that's one thing,
or I sit on Ellie's feet,
or our legs are kinda
like wrapped like that.
(Ellie laughs)
That's literally how we sleep.
- Usually how we sleep is our butts touch
and then our legs are
wrapped up, just our ankles,
but then our heads and
shoulders are kept away.
- You're a bum toucher,
and I have never liked you more.
Mosey on in there, in your
little cocoon of happiness.
- Put this in between my
legs, this on my butt.
Ahh.
-  You look like
you're in heaven, good.
You close your eyes.
- Now turn off the light!
(Jared laughs)
-  I love you sweetie.
- Oh, I love you.
(Jared laughs)
- Now this is the life.
Sitting down, painting your fingernails.
I have Calvin's liquid bandage glue
cause one of my nails broke and
I'm gonna see if that'll work,
while your husband cooks dinner.
(upbeat music)
Yeah!
-  Oo!
-  Good job!
- I see people do this all the time.
-  Oh my.
Maybe you need a bigger knife,
like a butcher knife or something.
All of our kids are in bed,
so we can enjoy dinner.
-  Oh, she disappeared!
There she is.
She is watching us like a hawk.
- But this girl.
Why aren't you in bed?
Go to bed, go go.
(laughs)
- Do you wanna get in your bed?
-  Aww!
- That's funny.
We'll give you a little, Penny.
- Yeah we'll give you some.
She's been a good girl.
-  When we're done.
So I'm gonna talk about something
and I know a lot of
people will not love this
but I hope that everybody, I know
that a lot of people are
gonna be very supportive,
Jared and I talked a lot
about when the baby comes,
we'll be filming Monday through Friday
and that will give us a few days to recoup
you know, adjusting with baby, and
I've been telling Jared lately,
just with how I've been feeling mentally,
like I feel really good some days
and some days I really don't, and
how I feel physically right now,
I need a few days to recharge and
Sundays we go to church
and then we come home
and I just would love that time to just be
coming home and just not thinking.
So I would like to start doing a
Monday through Friday right now
and not film this weekend.
I feel like I need it mentally,
and I feel like it would be good for you,
editing wise, sleep wise, just
a recharge in life right now.
- Yeah.
- And I'm feeling really
good and I want to
do this before I like, don't, you know.
- You wanna stay ahead of it, you know.
- And my goal this year, my one goal,
is just peace, I just wanna feel peaceful
with the decisions I make, and this is
a decision I wanna make
and I'm gonna make it
and I'm going to be happy and peaceful
with that decision, and I'm just slowly
thinking about how I'm feeling and
just doing what I need to do.
- And, as a husband, I
want to support that.
I wanna support you, and I
wanna support our family,
and our happiness, and if
that's what we have to do,
then by gosh, gall darn
it, we're gonna do it.
- Well thank you.
- I love you.
- I love you, and we love you guys
and we're grateful for your support.
Like I said, I know that some people
are gonna be like, "No!"
but I need to do it if I'm going to...
I just need that.
(laughs)
Thank you guys so much for watching today.
We really appreciate it.
I'm going to go snuggle my little pillow,
don't worry, I'll keep my feet for you.
- I was gonna say, I want, at least
give me one foot to sit on.
(laughs)
- Okay, we'll see you guys, bye.
