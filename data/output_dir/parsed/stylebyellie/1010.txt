American Idol and it wants us in the
solo he was very whiny so last night was
really rough on all of us miksa Jackson
Jackson slept like a change always slips
through the crying but I don't feel very
well I think I don't feel well one I'm

cup and he was holding it up and he was
reaching down to get more rocks kept
falling out and he did it like three
times I was hoping to catch it oh he's
getting frustrated like him lemon you
