(bright funky music)
- Happy fall break.
- Good morning.
I can't think of a better way
to spend the freezing morning
than in the hot tub.
- I hope you guys are gonna have
- Happy fall break.
- Happy fall break.
(splashing)
(Ellie laughing)
-  Are you gonna let go?
(laughing)
Okay let go.
- Swim!
-  Let got and swim.
- Let go and swim.
- Ahhhh.
(yelling)
So we have what we feel like
is this beautiful scenery.
And we've seen a lot
of people on Pinterest,
Instagram doing these
underwater photo shoots,
so we were like,
let's try and imitate this
and Ellie thinks it's gonna turn out
(splashing)
really good, and I'm not sure
how well it's gonna turn out,
but we're gonna try it nonetheless.
- I just think it'll be hilarious
compared to Bryan and Missy's like really
beautiful photo shoot,
where everyone can swim,
and then us, where we're like
- One two three go.
Whoa.
(sweet music)
(carnival music)
So we told you guys before
that we got a bunch of different costumes
for all the seasons, for
the holidays and everything.
And Jackson wants nothing
to do with one costume
in particular that he had on earlier.
So he has his Spiderman
outfit on right now
and Calvin
- So cute.
-  is ready for his.
- Do you want to be a dog?
- No.
- What?
- What, you just said you did.
Come on, do you want
to be in your costume?
- I'm gonna shoot webs.
- Don't shoot me with webs,
I need to film and I have my arms to film
and if you shoot me with
webs, I can't do it.
- You charged them, it worked.
-  Wait, give it a second.
(Calvin crying)
You want it off?
- Yes.
- Awww, sorry Mom.
- He doesn't like it.
- Calvin doesn't want to
wear the costume either.
- What are you gonna wear?
- No!
- Maybe none at all?
- Which is so sad, because this
is the costume that you wanted to wear.
It's kind of a bummer.
- Look, Mommy's gonna be a dog, look.
(panting)
- No.
(barking)
- You want to wear it?
- No.
(panting)
(barking)
- Do you want to try it?
- No.
(Jared laughs)
- You're a pill.
You know, that's what you have to do
if you want candy, is
you put on the costume
and you go door to door,
and you say I want candy, trick or treat,
and that's how you get candy,
but you can't do it without the costume,
the costume is the most important part
other than the day.
If you don't have a costume
and you say trick or treat,
people are like what are you doing.
- When I put my costume on,
I get trick or treat.
- That's right.
See Jackson's got it.
- Tonight, I got tickets, we're gonna go
to a Dino Park and they have
some activities for kids there.
-  Ooh, Dinosaur Park.
- Okay well I'm bummed..
-  Sorry.
- Mommy.
Mommy.
- Where's Mommy?
- Which one's Mommy?
- There's Mommy.
-  That's right.
-  Is that Mommy?
- That's Mommy.
- Where's
- No, that's Mommy.
-  Where's Aunt Bonnie?
Where's Aunt Ruby?
-  Yeah, good job.
-  Where's Aunt Julie?
- Good job, that's so good.
- Good job.
- Now put your costume on.
Sweet, we may have found some.
Woo!
Do you want to be a tomato Jacks?
Or do you want to stick with Spiderman.
-  Spiderman.
-  Okay, that might work.
-  Okay, go fast,
he oh he took it off.
-  This might get us by.
- We made the long trek down
to prehistoric times.
We're gonna see some what, Jackson?
- Dinosaurs.
- Dinosaurs, look and we
can see through the fence.
And we can see one right there.
Does that look so cool?
Not just dinosaurs,
(car honks)
but some Halloween activities too.
Ooh oh look, there's a goose or a swan
and some ducks.
More than just dinosaurs too, huh.
- There's the park over there.
-  Yeah.
- We've been waiting in line
and as soon as they let us in,
Jackson frantically,
Calvin Calvin, come on,
and he was waiting, making
sure Calvin was by him.
What did you say to him?
- Trick or roar.
-  Trick or roar.
- Trick or roar.
-  I'm glad he did it.
- Just grab one.
- Just grab one.
-  Perfect.
- So guys like Spiderman
and Captain Ameica
might be super strong, but
T Rex is pretty tough too
in some ways, you might not think.
His head was tough,
but each of those arms that everyone likes
to talk about how small they were,
each of those arms could
lift about 400 pounds.
-  Oh my gosh, he's
almost as strong as Dad.
- Trick or roar.
-  Trick or roar.
-  I'm glad that he says it.
- Those glasses are kinda crazy.
I'm just laughing at this bear.
Ask him which dinosaur this is?
- What one?
- Do you know it?
- This one's called an Acrocanthosaurus.
- What?
- It's an Acrocanthosaurus.
-  Oh my goodness.
- Why's that spider here?
-  The spider?
-  Yeah, there's a spider.
-  He's like that
one's more colorful.
- Trick or roar, trick or roar, trick or
trick or trick or roar.
-  This is an interesting dinosaur,
I've never seen this kind before.
Have you ever seen that kind of dinosaur?
It's kinda weird, huh.
- Look at that green dinosaur right there.
- Whoa.
I know we've given the
Tyrannosaurus rex some grief
for having just little tiny arms,
but T Rex, don't worry,
I've got your back covered, okay?
- This is something else.
-  This is something else.
So here's the dinosaur,
and you're probably thinking,
like where are his arms?
Like where are they?
Oh, they're just so tiny.
They're so tiny, why are they so tiny?
-  But its feet are huge.
-  Yeah, its feet are huge.
Oh there we go.
-  And its legs, look at 'em.
(Jared laughs)
(lively music)
-  Let's see it.
Oh yeah, gotta put your
fingers in the hole,
that'll help.
- Look at that car right there.
-  Squirrel.
Yeah, nice work, now pick up that spare.
Aww, so close.
Yeah, got one more good job Spidey.
Whoa, that was like a fast ball.
Maybe he'll get six,
that's a great letter.
Whoa, I.
-  What's the letter?
-  U.
Hittin' those vowels.
- I love golf, I love golf.
- I think Jackson is very
excited to play golf.
Are you loving getting all this candy?
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to see how you play.
- Okay, I'm gonna do this psshh.
-  Whoa.
-  Here you go, are you ready?
- Okay, can you get it
in the hole Jackson?
And it's all in the hips.
-  Okay let him do it.
Only girlfriends think that's cute.
-  That's from Happy Gilmore.
- Ooh.
- That was good.
-  Okay one more time.
Oh so close.
Yeah!
Aww, Daddy's not very good.
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah.
- Dun dun dun, there's a play ya ya.
(laughing)
Na na na na na na na na.
-  Spiderman's flat on the floor.
-  This is
bringingthe fun out in him.
- Bon bon, na na na na na.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, go for the top one.
Aww, it's okay Mom,, keep going.
Yeah!
- You made it on the top.
- I did.
-  Awww, air ball.

smile on your face today.

I want to show you something so cool.
Come here, Cal.

Do you know what owl's say?
They say hoo hoo.
Do you see that Calvin?
Do you see that owl?
Did you ever dissect
owl poop in sixth grade?
- No.
-  We totally did.
- Tell me about it.
- Well so we would have owl poops
and we put gloves on and used tools
and we'd find like mice bones
and all of that kind of stuff.
- Oh you know what, I think we did.
-  Calvin look,

Seriously this is the club.
I've got one two three four five screens,
but only two of them are going right now.
I am working on three videos right now,

but to give her credit,
she's the one that actually edited it.
I'm doing the thumbnail
and the upload right now.
I've got a vlog that's going up tomorrow,
