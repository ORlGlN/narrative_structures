(laughing)
(bright music)
-  You guys aren't
being much help around here.
- When I dip, you dip, we all dip.
- I'm not that smart.
I need my phone to do stuff for me.
Do you agree Ellie?
She said yes.
Darn it.
- Spouses that cook
together, stay together.
- Hey!
What would you like to fondue next.
(Jared laughs)
-  Hi cutie patootie.
- Hi cutie patotty.
-  What are you drinking?
- Coconutties.
-  What?
He thinks these are called cococonutties.
But he's drinking some grape juice.
- Those are corn pops.
-  Corn pops, that's correct silly.
You tryin' to trick me.
- Yeah.
-  Don't be a trickster.
- I want to go with you downstairs.
-  You want to
come with me downstairs?
- Yes.
Ahhhh.
-  Good morning.
- Good morning.
- It is a gorgeous day outside.
Look at that sun.
It's so bright.
The rock tumbler is still going.
(tumbler humming)
We've got two days left on this cycle.
And then we've got another seven days
and then I think another
five days after that.
But Mom is out doing
some errands real quick
and this kitchen is a disaster.
We got home last night
and we kinda just unloaded everything.
We didn't really put
everything single thing away,
other than clothes,
so boys
I think it's time for
operation mission mission
that we clean up this kitchen,
before Mom gets home.
Because little surprises like that
are the best ever.
(laughing)
You guys aren't being
much help around here.
What the heck?
- Hey, I just did that out of habit.
I turned the camera on
and I went to flick the screen up
and I don't have to any more, the lens up,
because it's fixed, because
we have a new camera.
Jared!
Kitchen looks amazing,
that was so sweet to come home to.
Look what Cullen and Katie
got us for Christmas.
I want to go get some bread today.
I want to figure out
what to do with all this.
It's a dipping, a dipping session.
So when I dip, you dip, we all dip!
Did I do that right?
-  Yeah that's how it works.
- Jared made me do that.
Jared wanted me to say that.
I don't even know what I'm talking about,
he's like just make sure if you do this,
tell 'em that we dip, we
all dip, I don't know.
Anyway, they got us this dipping stuff,
which is really cool.
I need to read if it's just
regular bread you use or,
looks like it.
It says easy and fun to dip.
That's so cool.
I love gifts like this.
Thank you guys.
Let's do that.
Okay, so today, tonight,
what we should do is do bread dipping
and then tonight I'll get
some chocolate stuff too,
so we can dip bread
and chocolate, how fun.
That's what we'll do tonight.
We're in the parking lot (laughs)
of the grocery store,
with the sun in my eyes.
And Jared, what are you doing?
- I'm on a mission Ellie.
I'm on a very important mission
and the mission is all about Instant Pot.
I thought, I was like, you know what,
we've got this Instant Pot,
when I was cleaning the
kitchen, I was like,
I really want to use it
and take advantage of it.
So I'm looking up--
- Agreed.
- Instant Pot recipes,
because I think like--
oh Instant Pot Chicken Teriyaki,
boom, that's exactly
what I was looking for.
Some sort of chicken
and rice and vegetables
sounds really great tonight.
- Have you guys used
your Christmas gifts yet?
I've used my Instant Pot a few times,
but for boiled eggs,
so tonight we are gonna try it
for the first time making a meal.
- You did it with eggs though,
oh so this is the meal.
This is the real deal meal.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, this is us trying it out.
- We're not gonna do veal,
-  Ew, I don't want veal.
- But it's gonna be a real deal meal.
- I'm just trying to rhyme.
- Okay let's go.
- So look five minutes to prepare,
five minutes to cook,
served with broccoli over a bed of rice,
quinoa or flatbread, ain't no
thing, let's get some chicken.
- Perfect.
Smith's Marketplace.
We usually go to the
grocery store right by us,
but our neighbor, they just got a hot tub
and they told Jared that this place
has the hot tub supply stuff.
- And it's like 50% cheaper
- Yeah.
- than, but let's go inside,
because I want to show ya.
- Let's go try.
- So all the chemicals
that we use in the hot tub
are based off of test strips.
They're just like this
and you put it in the water
and then it shows the
results on colored strips
and then you have to match that
within a certain color range.
But my neighbor was telling me,
he's like I went to Smith's Marketplace
and found that they have smart strips,
that you can actually
connect it with your phone,
and it'll tell you exactly
how much you need to do.
So I'm going to try that
and see how much better it is.
Because I like smart stuff,
because I'm not that smart,
I need my phone to do stuff for me.
Do you agree Ellie?
She said yes.
Darnit.
PH up, PH down, clarifier.
Sometimes I just laugh at myself
and ourselves, our little hot tub supply
and Instant Pot grocery shopping
turned into a fondue
dessert part shopping.
- And Jackson's birthday shopping.
What?
- Yeah, surprise there.
It's a secret, we can't tell ya.
But we walked out of there,
and I'm looking at our groceries,
and I'm like, we're gonna have
a fondue party tonight, like dessert.
We got chocolate, we got goodies
to dip in the chocolate.
It's gonna be a great night.
- Seriously, thank you Cullen and Katie.
I think that's what we'll do
when the kids go to bed.
- Yeah, oh yeah yeah.
- We'll have dinner
- - Much too good for children.
- And then we'll party.
- Tots.
- Yeah.
- Hot tub, dipping, chocolate.
- Yes, we're gonna dip.
We dip, you dip.
- No Ellie, it's the (laughs)
I heard her in the other room.
It's when I put your hand upon your hip,
then I dip, you dip, we dip.
I put your hand up on my hip,
then I dip, you dip, we dip.
You know what I mean?
-  Tots.
- You got it?
You feeling me?
You picking up what I'm putting down?
- Spouses that cook
together, stay together.
- Hey!
- Jared's cutting, I'm cutting.
I got the veggies, he's got the meat.
We're gonna try this.
I hope they taste good.
It's our first official meal
in our Instant Pot.
- Insta Pot.
- Insta Pot or Instant Pot?
-  Instant or Insta?
I like Insta.
- I like Insta Pot, but I
think it says Instant Pot.
I don't know.
(tumbler humming)
Mr. Jackson's rock tumbler,
his rock tumbler only has one more day
until we add another grit in,
and then we are on grit three
of shining his rocks.
We only need to do one
more cycle of seven days,
then it's done.
- I can't do these parts.
-  You can't do these parts,
you're doing so good.
Wow.
That one?
Yep, that's a good one.
You're doing good.
He's getting a little flustered.
- Mom, but this one's not going right.
-  Let me see.
-  The turtle one.
-  Oh well that's the spot.
Oh, you just kinda had to push it.
Or it's a new one, we're breaking it in.
There you go.
Where do you think that goes?
(Ellie laughs)
So many choices.
Look at the biggest piece left.
- Here.
-  Perfect.
- It goes here.
-  I like that.
- Okay, don't spill everything.
-  Well that's the
weirdest way I would've--
-  How would you have done it?
-  Not with the whisk.
Oh my.
(Jared laughing)
- I'll clean it up, I promise.
-  Is everyone else cringing?
-  Look, 90% of
it made it in there.
-  It's just a
small mess, but (laughs).
-  Perfect.
-  Don't forget your onion.
-  The less onion the better.
-  Let's see it.
Wow, good job.
Do you want to do it again?
- I want, but I want help.
-  You want a little help?
Okay, get the honey in there.
♪ Oh honey honey bum bum bum bum ♪
Mr. Calvin is asleep.
It is six o'clock.
So either he'll wake up in an hour
and be up 'til 10.
Or he'll be in bed for the night.
- I'm assuming it'll be the former.
-  Crap, so he's gonna have to eat
all the good stuff with us.
Aww.
(Ellie laughs)
- We need to turn it on.
-  Do you see the pressure level?
-  We need to turn it on.
How do you turn it on?
-  I don't know, when I did it,
I just did pressure cook.
(beeping)
- Oh.
- I want to do it.
- High pressure.
Okay push it, now push it again.
Good job.
- High pressure.
-  For how many minutes?
- For five.
Got it.
-  Okay, now I think you
don't need to push anything.
It just starts going.
-  I hope so.
(beeps)
- There we go.
- Oh it's on.
- We can figure this out.
-  It's like a
little time machine thing.
Okay, we're gonna figure it out.
I just want you to know
that this has not been the easiest.
There's dog hair.
Not the easiest process
and we both may have
gotten a little impatient
with the Instant Pot and each other.
- We're learning.
-  You happy?
The chicken is done.
The sauce is done.
The veggies look awesome
and the rice is done.
So I think we can eat.
We're gonna get it all situated.
- Phew.
Got it.
(Ellie laughs)
-  What's your thoughts?
Is it good or bad?
- Good!
- It's good?
Okay, you ate your
broccoli, eat your rice.
Jare bear?
- Sorry I'm taking a
picture for Instagram.
(laughs)
It looks good, doesn't it?
- It really does.
- I haven't tasted it yet.
- It's not like it's hard, it was just,
they're a little
intimidating to work with.
- Well yeah, because if
you make one wrong move,
Psssssssssssssst,
- It's a little intimidating.
- You know?
- But I think if we use it more
than a few times, we'll
get the hang of it.
This looks amazing.
That looks so good.
- What impressed me the most was
how fast and how well
the chicken was cooked.
-  Oh yeah.
- You know?
Cooked all the way through,
moist and soft, like yeah.
- What do you think?
What do you think Jare?
- I think it could use
a little more sauce.
- What did we do, so people know.
- So for my first Instant Pot creation,
what I did was I took chicken breasts
and I sliced them in half,
placed them in the bottom
of the Instant Pot,
put in some pepper flakes,
some ginger powder, ginger
powder, is that right?
-  Mmm-hmmm, mmm-hmm.
- Some pepper and a little bit of salt.
- And you put a separate bowl
and you put in onion, bell pepper,
whatever veggies you want,
you put in a half a cup of honey.
- Yep, I did, that was fun.
- Half a cup of honey, a
little bit of olive oil.
- Yep.
- You did a little bit of ginger,
a little bit of pepper flakes,
pretty much whatever flavoring you want.
- And then I did two
tablespoons or three tablespoons
of Teriyaki sauce.
And I felt like I could
do a little bit more.
- We should've added like a half a cup.
- Yeah seriously, we should've put it on,
and that's the nice thing
about Teriyaki sauce,
is you can just add it in
after the fact.
- Yeah.
- But then we put it on cook mode,
it did pressure cooking for five minutes
and that's all it needed
for the chicken to cook
all the way through.
It was cooked all the way through,
because we cut it in half,
so it was pretty thin.
And then after that, we put--
- And the veggies were perfect.
- Yeah, the veggies were perfect.
- Almost overdone.
- Yeah.
We put corn starch and water in the bottom
of the pot, with all of the oils
that were left over in the liquids
that were left over.
Sauteed that, let it boil,
put the chicken back in,
mixed it all together and that's it.
We put it on rice and there you have it.
It looks really good.
- It could've had more flavor.
- Yeah definitely.
But I feel like if we knew exactly
what we're doing, like if
we did this again tomorrow,
it would take about 15 minutes
to do this entire thing.
-  Yep.
- Maybe less, maybe 10
minutes so it's pretty good.
Definitely I want to experiment more
with the Instant Pot.
I feel like breakfasts would be really fun
to experiment with, and
then especially dinners.
And I feel like this is a really great
and easy way to cook chicken,
which is like a really healthy meat
that I want to do more of,
because you're're always
trying to be healthy.
- And I like broccoli, I like broccoli.
- At the beginning of the year.
Yeah, you do like broccoli.
So yay or nay?
- Yay.
- Yay!
We got the kids to bed
and now it is us time.
It is we time, it is parents time,
it is married time.
It's been one year since we've
pulled out the fondue pot
and that means it's been one year
since I've put it together.
So I may be doing this wrong.
I know you're supposed to have a match
and this fire gel,
but I feel like there's
a terrible combination
that if something goes wrong,
it could blow the house up,
just like the Instant Pot.
We're playing with fire
today Ellie, literally.
Okay, ready?
-  Yeah.
-  Here goes nothing.
That wasn't too bad.
- Awesome.
-  Just got a little
bit of chocolate in there
we've got some marshmallows,
some shortbread and then
we've got Cullen and Katies'
little Christmas gift.
We're gonna dip some bread in Tuscany
and what did you say Rosemary?
- Parmesan.
-  Parmesan, Tuscany and Parmesan
dipping stuff with some sauce
that we'll pour into these bowls.
I guess not all of our kids are in bed.
(chill guitar music)
Hi Penny girl.
Are you having fun with
your new Christmas present?
Huh, are you enjoying that very very much?
-  Well this is amazing.
This is amazing.
Penny's like please help
me get the treat out.
Look at her.
- She's having a hard time.
-  Aww, we'll help you a little.
She kept going to her place,
to the living room and to her place,
trying to like--
- She's like now if I change positions,
maybe I can get this.
I'm gonna try over here right now.
-  Get it?
Oh did it go back in?
-  Did she push it back in?
Aww Penny, bring it to me.
- She's like okay, one more time?
- What would you like to fondue next?
(laughing)
- Welcome to a vlog where we
stayed in the kitchen all day.
-  Pretty much, yeah.
- This was fun, I loved it.
-  It was fun.
- And look how full my belly is.
-  Aww, it's almost
like you're pregnant.
Oh wait, you are.
-  I think I'm
like 15 weeks tomorrow.
-  Man these weeks go by so fast.
- Oh my gosh.
I was talking to Bonnie today,
'cause we were talking about something
and I was like oh I can
just suck my belly in
and I was like, oh I can't.
It's still there.
And we laughed so hard.
'Cause you know how, when
you're first pregnant,
it's kind of like a food baby in a way.
You just suck it in and it's gone,
It's like oh, just kidding,
it's a legit babe now.
- Can't do that anymore.
-  Yeah.
Oh my goodness gracious.
- What?
- Seeing your face right
through this camera
with your hand on your chin
like that takes me back.
It takes me back to when hoo,
I was doing my hip surgery recovery
and I was on my hospital
bed in my grandma's house,
that I stayed for three months.
And you came almost every single day
while I was recovering.
-  I left hair school early.
- Mmm-hmm, you did.
But there was one picture
I took on my Palm Trio 650 and--
-  I was doing that.
- Yeah, you were doing that.
And you look identical to that.
I want to see if I can find that picture
and I'll put it in here if I can.
- What?
-  But yeah,
you're just so beautiful
and pretty and it just,
- Thanks.
-  It took me back.
- We had so much fun.
That's seriously, we fell
in love just talking.
- We fell in love during
my hip surgery recovery.
It's kind of embarrassing,
but it's also kind of sweet.
- It's cute.
Like we really didn't even,
we didn't kiss.
I'd say goodbye.
- Because my grandma and Mom
and Dad were right there.
- Well yeah and it's
like you were like sick,
you were in bed sick,
so instead of kissing, we talked,
like normal people.
- Yeah, I was bedridden for three months.
Like that was hard, that was
a difficult time, you know?
- What was your favorite food
when you were bedridden?
Did you like soup?
You didn't like much food at all.
- Yeah I didn't like food at all.
I remember one day I craved ribs or steak
and I threw it all up,
-  Oh!
- because it was just way too much for me.
But soups and jello and
those kinds of things,
that's all I could put down and eat.
Everything else was just too much.
- We were just babies.
We still are.
I still feel weird.
- We are.
- Yeah, is it weird that in my head,
so I'm 29 years old,
but in my head I still feel like
I'm 18 or 22 or something like that.
I guess maybe that's what 29 feels like,
but in my head it's just like,
I don't feel any different in my head
than I did when I was 22.
- Oh yeah, that's why
sometimes I feel weird.
I feel like I'm still yeah,
like 16.
- Like a kid, yeah.
- So anyway, we are kids
having fondue parties.
-  Yep.
- And that's where we're
calling it a night.
I've had so much fun with you today.
- You too.
-  Thank you for
cooking dinner with me.
Thank you for--
- Thanks for cleaning.
-  You're welcome.
Thanks for melting chocolate with me.
And thanks Cullen and Katie
for the bread and the dipping.
- That was such a fun gift,
I loved it.
- It was.
-  That was sweet.
Ellie's gonna keep those forever.
- I know, we just added tons
more to finish our bread.
We're gonna go watch a movie.
We're gonna say goodbye.
- Thanks for watching guys.
Have a wonderful night
and we will see you.
- Tomorrow.
- Bye baby, give me a kiss.
-  I don't know when
my doctor appointment is,
but it's soon.
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.
