- Before dinner, somebody may have gotten
a little in trouble.
- Hallelujah, halle--
- We're in our oasis.
Do people with campers do something cool?
- Found a monkey in the tree!
(cheerful music)
Are you gonna film or are
you gonna help? (chuckles)
(cheerful music)
Jackson wants to know why
he loves rocks. (chuckles)
And I said, "I don't know, you just do."
Do you still like rocks?
- I love golden rocks.
- Golden rocks.
We're gonna go on an adventure today.
- I love golden blue rocks.
- Golden poo rocks?
- No, golden blue rocks.
- Ohh, I could've sworn you said poo.
You said golden blue. (chuckles)
We're just waiting on Calvin to wake up,
and then we are going!
- Good morning, Calvin.
You ready to go?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, 'kay, let's do a little roll call.
Big dog, check.
Doggie blanket, check.
Little dog, check.
I think you're all set to go.
- Mm-hmm.
- You got everything?
- Grab a blanket, I've got mine,
Jackson's got his, let's go!
- Let's go!
Yeah, we got one more person.
We'll get all these people loaded,
and then we'll bring our favorite, Penny.
We can't forget Penny,
that's the other roll call.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Pen.
- Let's go!
-  We're saluting
every camper that we drive by.
(laughs)
Did he say hi?
- Yeah, he did. (laughs)
He gave me a little peace sign.
Well, I was just thinking, you know,
I gave that guy a little, a salute,
because he was, you know,
he had a trailer, too.
Motorcycles, when they see
each other pass on the road,
they like do a little, you
know, a little hand wave.
Subarus, when they see
each other on the road,
they do a little gesture to each other,
like hey, you drive a
Subaru, you're cool, too.
Do people with campers do something cool?
Do people with Teslas do something cool?
Like, am I missing out on being in this
exclusive hand gesture group?
-  You're gonna
have to look at your
Facebook group that you're a part of now.
- I will, I will have to look at.
So we have an expandable trailer,
so the beds pop out.
- Jared's told me this
probably, like, 100 times,
so I think he should probably tell you.
- It just makes me laugh.
But, you know, sometimes it can get cold,
or you don't have a lot of people
that you're traveling with, so you don't
have to pull the beds out, you can just
use the beds on the inside.
And they call that turtling.
(laughs)
Get it, 'cause the turtle heads and tail,
they don't pop out.
They're turtling.
-  It's cute.
- They're turtling!
Okay, oh, stretch those legs, Miss Penny.
(laughs) You've been
the best passenger ever.
Let's go!
Do you want some water?
I got some nice cold
water for you, let's go.
So this is a trip that we are taking
the whole fam damily on.
We've got Penny with us,
and we have some fun things
scheduled to take Penny and the kids on.
We wanted to get out into
the nature and wilderness.
Well, I mean, I guess as far as
the nature goes where we're going.
It's not the most scenic place,
but it's a wonderful place
for kids and family and dogs.
So we're really excited
to take Penny with us
on this trip, because
I feel like she's been
missing out a little bit.
She's sniffing poo right now.
She's not really missing
out on what she wants.
This is what she wants to do right now.
Smell other dog's poo.
It's kind of, kind of weird, I guess.
- Traveling with kids,
whether it's luxury or not,
can sometimes be a little stressful.
Calvin, at the very last
minute walking out the house,
I was like, we should grab his potty!
Because he's really good to go
to the bathroom at our house,
on our toilets, but when
we're out and about,
he's very hesitant, and especially toilets
that automatically flush.
Oh boy, no, hmm-mm.
And so I just went in
the bathroom, I went,
Jackson went, and then
it was Calvin's turn,
and he just (screams).
And I was like, okay,
let's go use your potty,
it's in the car, and he willingly,
thank you very much, used his potty.
So, I'm really glad we brought it,
but like I said, sometimes it's,
traveling with kids, that's what you do.
You bring their potties,
you bring what they need,
you bring the stuff to clean it out.
But I'm proud of you, good job!
- Thanks, Mom.
- And someday you won't
be scared of it, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just kind of loud right now?
Does it go (imitates toilet flushing)?
(Calvin mumbles)
Next time will you try it?
- Um, no.
- Nope. (laughs)
Very honest.
The fun thing about driving
in the middle of nowhere,
where no cars are around...
(horn honks)
You can horn to the music.
- Our horn almost is almost
exactly on pitch with that note.
(Ellie chuckles)
Not anymore, 'cause of
the key change, obviously,
but you know what I mean?
(honking horn)
("How Far I'll Go" by Auli'i
Cravalho plays in background)
(laughs)
-  Calvin's asleep, Penny's asleep.
Hi, Jackson!
What are you eating?
Peanuts!
- The jet, Dad.
-  What do you see?
- The jet.
-  Oh, a jet, that's cool!
Famous Jet Johnson was up there.
-  Hey, you know
that hill up ahead?
-  The really,
really steep one up there?
-  I feel like we're gonna need to
fill up on gas when we're done. (laughs)
- Probably, right after that.
Look at that beautiful scenery.
That is behind us.
Welcome to the land of no snow.
Doesn't it feel to not be
where any snow is right now?
- Found a monkey in the tree!
A scared monkey.
-  Yeah, a scared monkey.
Yay, you caught the
monkey, let's keep him!
- I found a Spider-Man in the tree!
-  Look at you, Spidey, woo-hoo!
Nice work.
(relaxed music)
We're here!
We're in heaven, we're
in our oasis. (laughs)
Let me show you the coolest part,
but I've gotta hurry,
because we've got kids
in the car that we need to get out
because they are anxious.
I am ready, too.
Check that out.
There's the pool,
there's a putting course.
It's gonna be fun.
-  Maybe tomorrow
we can get in it, okay?
I think it's back there somewhere.
(gasps) Cool, huh?
'Kay, let's go get Penny and our bikes.
(pleasant music)
- That's your bed, Cal.
Do you like your bed?
- Yeah, it's warm.
-  It's warm? (laughs)
One, two, three, up!
There you go.
What do you think?
- It's good.
-  It's good?
(chuckles)
(pleasant music)
- It's the end of a long,
long travel day. (laughs)
Penny is getting some much
needed running time in,
and we are hitting the hay.
The kids are set up over
here, our bathroom is set up
right here, it's been a long time
since we've showed you guys.
Our fridge is nice and full, I precooked
a bunch of food in there.
So we are all set to go for food.
Jared and I over there.
The first day is always a little crazy.
The kids are spent, Penny is
spent, Mom and Dad are spent.
Jared's finishing up his walk.
I just got a little dinner ready.
Super easy, I just
pre-made, I just pre-cooked
some ground beef before I came,
and we're having nacho
salad, nacho tacos in a bag.
Super easy, super yummy, the kids are just
(chuckling) loving their chips.
- We are newbies still.
There are like five
fires, not actual fires,
but like, you know, fires
that I'm putting out,
trying to get things figured out.
Penny is right here right now.
She may or may not have dinner tonight.
I will get her dinner
tonight, don't worry.
But anyway, as I was getting everything
solved and figured out, Mom told me that
you kids said a good prayer.
What did you say in your prayer tonight?
-  I did a beautiful, um--
- You did a beautiful one?
- A beautiful song.
My song was like this.
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪
- That's a good prayer.
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪
'Kay, I'm gonna ask Mom in a second.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, friend.
- Aww! (chuckles)
We have such a fun adventure
for the next couple days.
So we need to go--
(Calvin vocalizing)
Yeah.
- Go hiking to find a golden rock for me.
- I think that sounds like a great idea.
So we're gonna have a lot of fun tomorrow.
that means we need to go to bed tonight
and get some sleep, okay?
- Yup.
- Yeah, so will you boys
lay down on your beds?
- Why are you gonna lay with Mom?
- 'Cause that's where Daddy sleeps.
- Why is Penny down there?
- Well, 'cause that's where Penny sleeps.
'Kay, lay in your beds and we'll say
goodnight to our friends, okay?
Lay down.
- Night, friends.
-  Night, friends.
-  Goodnight.
(children giggling)
-  No you close eyes.
-  No, you close your eyes.
(Calvin giggles)
Open your eyes.
(giggling)
- Before dinner, somebody may have gotten
a little in trouble.
Just sassiness,
four-year-old was going on.
And I talked to Jackson about
it, and he got in trouble,
and when he was saying his prayers,
he was so cute, and he was like,
"And I will be good to
my mother tomorrow."
(laughs)
I literally was like, "You are so cute!"
My mother, I never refer
to myself as mother.
I just thought it was really cute.
I'm really glad to hear them laughing.
We are going to say
goodnight, and I can't wait
to take everyone on an adventure tomorrow.
Today it was getting
here, we were driving,
what, nine hours.
Plenty of stops for everyone.
Everyone was just like, ready to conk.
Except those two, good grief.
'Kay, see you tomorrow guys, bye!
