- This is gonna be us when we're old.
That's a needle.
I am so proud of him.
I can't even believe that.
-  What the heck?
(soft music)
- Boys, how come you are so cute?
Are you ever naughty?
Do you ever get in trouble?
- Nope.
- You don't?
- Uh-uh.
- Do you ever get sent to the corner?
- When I'm naughty.
- When you're naughty?
(laughing)
I think that answers my question.
I told the camera, I'm like,
you're so cute, and then I'm like,
I always say that 'cause mommas, you know,
we always think our babies are cute.
But we have an early
morning, busy morning.
Threw a hat on, I'm good to go.
Going to the dermatologist
to check out that bad boy.
My little freckle that I
think turned into a mole.
Joel thinks it's a zit under the freckle,
so maybe that's what it is.
Just to be cautious.
Jared and I have a ton of spots
all over our body that I
want checked out anyway,
so we are going to the dermato...
Well, school, dermatologist,
out to lunch, grocery shopping.
You know, the whole spiel.
That's what we're doing.
- How did you know if I drinked
all of your chocolate milk?
- Because it was mine and I saw it.
(laughing)
Mr. Jackson, I want to show everyone,
I am proud of you for
wearing different shoes!
These still fit pretty good.
Jackson's been obsessed
with those little gray shoes
that you've had since last summer
and I think they don't really fit anymore.
So now you're wearing those.
And I like them.
Okay, let's go to school.
You wanted me to take you today.
Hey, I love taking you to school.
You drive yourself, you've got it.
See ya.
- No.
- The button's already started.
Just go in, push the gas, you're good.
- No!
(laughing)
- Okay, I'll bring you.
True story, my brother, Bo,
when he was like two and a half or three,
ran my dad's car into the house.
It was a legit thing.
I think he undid the
emergency brake or something
and it rolled,
or he actually started it and it went,
but that happened.
Oh, I think they like us.
- I think do, too.
(laughing)
We've been giving good impressions.
I told them that we need to have them
take a picture of us in our gowns
and they're like, oh, okay.
(laughing)
- They laughed 'cause it was funny.
Calvin was very upset.
He's like why are your shoes off?
This is gonna be us when we're old.
(laughing)
- Don't worry, honey,
I've got your gown today.
- Thank you.
Make sure my butt isn't showing.
- You look cute in a gown.
I think you should have
one in like six months
and we'll do this all over again.
(laughing)
But in a different office.
Hey you, Calvin, should
we buy more diapers?
Should we go potty in the toilet?
(laughing)
He's like, oh, you wanna go now.
- Calvin has been doing awesome
with going poo in the potty.
Awesome.
I'm really proud of him.
That's a needle.
What are they doing?
- Dad's head.
- Dad's head?
Poking it?
Were you worried?
- Your turn.
(laughing)
Are they gonna poke her?
Yeah.
Here they go.
- The poke is not even bad.
- Yeah, it's the injection part.
You feel the burn?
- So this spot on my
face is just a freckle
with a zit under it and it's not a mole.
But I'm still glad we went in.
I'm not gonna lie, I felt a little like
I know we're young, but
I did have a really dark,
pre-cancerous spot on my back that he saw
and he's like, yeah, that needs to go.
And then we also removed
a bunch of other moles
that were just obnoxious, you know,
that we just wanted to get off.
So I'm so glad that we went in.
I think my family's had
a huge wake-up call,
especially with my aunt,
this last few years of
just really making sure
if you think something,
just go get it checked out.
My dad had a cancer spot.
- My dad had a cancer spot.
- Your dad had a cancerous melanoma spot.
- Yeah, so it's just good
to be on top of things,
to catch them early, 'cause
it's always better to do that.
So, you know,
while it might seem a
little silly to be like...
- At the moment I felt silly,
but I'm glad we did it.
- Yeah, I'm glad we did it, too
because knowledge is power.
And baby, you're powerful.
(laughing)
- So, side note, I was laughing
and the doctor looked at me and he goes,
Bonnie's sister?
He knew instantly when I started laughing
that I was Bonnie's sister.
- There's something about your laughs.
- I love it. (laughing)
- You especially.
(screaming)
- I loved it.
I thought it was so cute.
He used to work with Bonnie
and I think I found me
a nice place to go to
for some skin treatments.
I don't think I've ever gone to a place
and have had a facial.
And I would love to do that.
This year, I'm going to be 27 in April,
and I think it would be really fun
to go do a spa day at
the dermatology office
and do, like, skin stuff.
Alright, when the neighborhood
kids get home from school,
that will be all the way charged.
You wanna do that one?
You want your bike, Cal?
It's chilly.
- It's chilly.
- But the weather has been
pretty good for January.
We're actually gonna spend
a little time outside.
Calvin just fell asleep
at the grocery store.
Holy moly.
Glad you're happy now, mister.
Oh, he's already on it.
Good job, Jacks!
Jackson, you're doing so good!
Jackson!
And I can hear it beeping,
so we're gonna need
to charge it soon, okay?
Whoa, I am so proud of him!
I can't even believe that!
There's this new dog place
that opened up a while ago
that they have where
you can bring your dog,
and the dogs interact,
and then you can do
some training sessions.
So Jared and Penny just
got back from that.
How was it?
- It was good.
We've been working on a few things.
- Hi, Miss Pen.
- Hey, that's a good girl.
Can you sit for me?
- That's a good girl, not to run up.
I mean it used to be where she, oh see,
ooh ooh ooh.
She's gone to play with the neighbor.
- Touch.
Good girl!
- This kid is breaking out
all the cool garage toys.
When did you grow up, Jacks?
- Because I did.
- You just did?
Right, hover boards and skateboards now?
Think you're pretty cool
'cause you rode a bike
at two and a half?
- Uh huh.
(laughing)
- This summer, we're
gonna put you on a bike
and see how it goes.
A legit bike that doesn't have
training wheels or anything.
Holy moly!
Who thought it would be so
fun putting groceries away?
This is the best!
A back rub and putting groceries away?
He came up to me and
started rubbing my back.
What are you rubbing it with?
That's awesome!
Good job, dad.
- Have I been replaced?
- I love it.
- I'm not sure if I
should be upset or happy.
(music)
- I thought this shirt was really pretty.
-  What, purple and white?
- Yes, so it'll be fun with pies.
I can't wait!
-  I know it.
I know it.
- My mom and I are making pies tomorrow
for our cookbook,
and then next week we are going to Ruby's
and then that's a wrap.
So excited!
- Hey!
(music)
- Jackson, this is the last of the rocks.
Only the last cycle
and then you're ready to keep all of them.
- Can you believe that?
One more cycle.
Here we go.
- What the heck?
- Whoa!
What the heck?
I wanna keep all of them.
- Okay.
- You can!
Oh my gosh!
- Wow!
- Oh my heck!
- Oh my heck!
- Look at this gray one!
- I love that one.
- These look so great, Jackson.
Guess what?
We only have one more cycle,
and guess how long it is?
- What?
- Ten days.
All the grooves are smooth
and now this is gonna make it shiny.
- You know how these are all ready to go?
This next one will make them shiny.
So take one out 'cause we're
taking one out each cycle.
- Maybe one of the green ones.
- Do you wanna take one out?
- I wanna take all of the big green ones.
- Just those ones, okay?
- Yeah, just one, because
then when you're all done,
you can have all of them out.
So put one green one back.
Perfect.
Keep that one out.
- Good job, bud.
Alright, now this last one is ten days.
So we've got one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, days on this,
so we have to push it twice.
So hit set until it gets to seven.
Okay, keep pushing it.
Boom.
Push, push, push, push, push.
Now hit the power button.
Good job.
Okay, there it goes.
Last round.
(laughing)
Well, golly gee willakers,
look at this place.
My oh my, goodbye baseball,
Ellie's on the phone with Ginger.
Ellie and I have been working
the past couple of hours.
I've been out in the garage cleaning up.
She's been in here, cleaning
all of this stuff beautifully
because they have a photo shoot
for the cook book tomorrow!
And this is gonna be the
scene of the cook book,
part of it, anyway.
We're hitting all the
different siblings' houses
for the cook book.
(laughing)
But this is not for the cook book.
This is for us.
As we wind down our night tonight,
we are having nachos.
Not the healthiest thing,
but certainly one of the
most delicious things.
- I made dinner!
- Yeah, goulash.
Which is very healthy and
delicious to the taste.
- You're good.
- We're gonna watch a show tonight
as we wind down the night
and we're gonna have nachos
because that's the thing.
The kids are asleep.
They did really great
tonight going to bed,
and they love sharing a
bedroom and sharing a bed.
And it's just fun to have that, two boys.
I can't wait to have three boys.
Three boys!
Like, oh, I'm just a happy dad right now.
I felt the baby today, again.
How cool is that?
That I could just reach down, put my hand
on my wife's belly, and
feel our wiggly baby boy.
Do I have your full, undivided attention
now that you are done talking
to your friend Ginger?
- Yes, I'm just sending her pictures,
so no, you don't have
my undivided attention.
Okay, now you do.
What's up?
- I was going to say, as
we end the vlog tonight,
I wanted to let you know that
I have been going through the survey
and looking at the things that
you have recommended for us
and I'm so excited to do those things.
A lot of them have been
outdoor activities,
which I am excited to use the trailer for.
So, once it warms up a little bit,
like, I'm so excited to do those things.
- I think it would be fun to do one trip
before the baby comes.
- Yeah, look at your little baby bump.
- I mean, it's a little
crazy, like me pregnant,
you know, traveling.
Sleeping in a camper.
- Yeah.
And that's why it's cool.
- It's fun, but I can't do
that with a two-month-old,
you know?
- Not yet!
(laughing)
That's where we're gonna end the vlog.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up.
If you're new to this channel,
hit that subscribe button.
Oh, one more thing before we take off.
Weird thing today.
So our video today is currently
trending in number five.
- I don't know what
YouTube does to do that.
- I have no idea because
below us, number six,
is Unbox Therapy, and they
have over 700,000 views
on their video today, and
we have like 50,000 views
on our video as of right now.
Real time is a little different,
but maybe the views don't matter
and this is like Whose Line is it Anyway?
Anyway, the points don't matter,
but the jokes are still funny.
So, thanks guys, and we
will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
Goodnight, Dr. Pepper.
