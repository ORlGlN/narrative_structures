- Good morning, everybody!
I have made it to the fireplace
and I don't think I'm gonna get up.
I grabbed my sheets to
go put them in the wash
and then I literally sat down
just from walking two feet.
I'm like, "Mm, I'm just gonna sit here."
We,
mister no pictures please,
we need to take the tree and decorate it.
(Calvin laughs)
Maybe in a few days.
That's what we need to do.
Do you wanna come touch it?
Calvin?
-  No.
-  Aww, I'm gonna touch the tree.
-  Yeah!
-  Oh, now you want to?
Come here, touch it.
Go, oh!
We've been touching it this morning
and pretending that it hurts.
- Ow!
-  Ow, that hurts on your back?
- Yeah!
-  Or, is it a good back scratcher?
Oo, your head!
Your neck?
(laughs)
You're crazy!
Hey, do you know that
used to be mama's truck?
And you put Peppa in the truck?
- Yeah!
(Ellie laughs)
- I hope we're gonna
be able to get him out.
Oh, we can, good.
It's a good thing he is playing right now
because I have mustered up enough energy
to kind of get ready a little bit.
And I'm using the last
of our carpet cleaner.
Or cleaner.
The Folex has been my favorite thing
for the carpet.
You guys suggested it to me.
But I just gotta clean up some spots,
that's soap that Calvin
decided to put there.
It's applesauce that I
let the kids eat in here.
Just got to clean it up.
You know what I'm really
grateful for today?
Is I'm really grateful
that there are still just a
few days left of November.
It kind of gives me,
I think I would feel a little antsy
if it was already December.
'Cause we have a lot we want to do,
and a lot to do.
But I feel really good that
there are still a few days left
that I can kind of
lay around, slowly do some things,
and then really get into
the Christmas season
and spirit in December.
I'm excited to decorate it
after I get a few things like this done,
like wipe up my house.
Look at Mama so I can see your face.
Does that work?
- Yeah!
- He wanted a hat.
(laughs)
We'll see what Jackson thinks of that.
We've gotta go pick up
Jackson from school,
and I don't know if Jackson's
gonna like him wearing his hat,
but he wanted to wear a hat.
I think he'll be fine.
Well, the hat situation went smooth.
Jackson got out of the car and goes,
"That's--"
- I want to hold your hand.
- Aww.
No, I'm holding Jackson's right now.
See, and then I'll hold yours
when we leave the store.
Hurry, look!
Is there a car?
Let's walk, let's walk.
When Jackson got out of the
car, he saw Calvin and goes,
"That's my hat."
Are you okay that
Calvin's wearing your hat?
- No.
-  He'll just
borrow it for the day.
- Why is he borrowing it?
-  'Cause he really
wanted to wear a hat.
(light guitar music)
- All right, listen up!
Here's the situation.
Here is the deal!
My wife is not happy
and I aim to please her!
I aim to make her happy,
to make her laugh,
and to make her smile!
'Cause she's my wife!
She's my wife
and I want to make my wife a happy woman!
- The sad thing is nobody ever sees
the real you.
- Yeah.
'Cause I did this all before.
- No, he didn't do this.
He did the funniest shiz
I have ever seen and I literally thought,
where the is the camera?
The time I laugh at you
and sometimes I feel like
it may look like I'm
annoyed, which I'm not.
- This is literally the
second time I'm doing this,
because I thought it was funny enough
to pull out the camera.
We couldn't find it.
- I told Jared,
I went back to Lowe's.
-  Yeah.
- I said, "I need these
blocks cut this way."
- Because they weren't square!
- They didn't cut them the way I thought
that they did yesterday.
-  Yeah.
- And the guy said "We
can't do 'em that small".
And I said "Okay, you did it yesterday."
He goes, "Well I didn't do it yesterday."
And I'm like, "Aw, shi."
I was like, "Okay."
So I said, "So, I can't get it done."
He's like, "Nope."
And I said, "'Kay."
I wasn't gonna fight it,
I had two screaming kids.
And I said "'Kay."
So I came home and told
Jared the girls were gonna
be fine with the size, but it's fine.
And he said.
- I'm gonna go back to Lowe's
and you know what I'm gonna tell 'em?
I'm gonna go tell 'em to suck an egg!
(laughing)
- And then he said, "And then you know
"what I'm gonna go do?
"I'm gonna go to my Mom's."
(laughing)
It was funny in the moment!
- It was funny in the moment.
So Mom has a band saw and
a chop saw and a sander.
It's actually my chop saw.
So I'm gonna take these.
-  So her garage is
more manly than ours.
- Hey, hey, half of it is my stuff!
(Ellie laughs)
And, so we're gonna cut these down to size
and I'm gonna take the kids with me
or at least one of 'em or
none of 'em, I don't know.
Just whatever, whatever makes Ellie happy!
'Cause that's what we're aiming to do!
She's got this assignment
in a couple of hours
for the church, and I
want to make this right.
So the kids and I are like--
- It'll be fine.
Girls don't care, it would still be fine.
But it just was not,
I was like, "Dang it."
You know, I was like, "Sure."
- So I'm taking matters into my own hands.
Have I said that four times already?
(heavy guitar music)
Shoot 'em with webs!
Ah, you got 'em!
Your husband has returned!
And I have good news.
Penny, this is cool stuff
but it is not for you to see,
this is for Mom.
It's not perfect, okay, but it's a heck
of a lot better than it was before.
- Who needs Lowe's when
I have the best husband?
- Oh, thanks.
- That is much better.
- Look how square and
perfect those are, Ellie.
- Thank you.
- You are so welcome.
You know what?
I even cut extra so in
case some of the girls
want to try over, start over, or mess up
or anything,
- That would be cute.
- There's extra for everyone.
We just gotta sand some of this down.
- That's cute.
- You are all set to go
for your December countdown.
- Well, thank you.
I'm actually ready to go now.
- Well guess what?
Those were done an hour ago.
-  Thank you.
- Woof!
We're good.
- I appreciate it.
- You're welcome, hey.
I love you.
- Ew!
Hey, now I, ugh!
(Jared making silly noises)
I wanna be really grateful,
but I'm also just like ugh!
(Jared laughs)
- The kids are going crazy right now.
And Penny is going crazy right now!
Hey, she is ready to go on a walk
and she knows she's gonna go on one.
So we're gonna go on a walk, okay?
-  It's just getting
towards the end of the evening,
and I don't know if I have any left in me.
(laughs)
- Let's go on a walk, sister.
Let's go for a walk.
- I don't have much
left in me.
Can you guys hear this?
(kids talking)
Oh my gosh, unlock the door, Cal!
Jackson, every time he
goes to the bathroom,
Calvin thinks that's
the perfect time to go
and demolish the bathroom
with toilet paper.
But Calvin just has come out of his shell,
the last few weeks,
and has just gone wild.
(metal crashes)
Calvin!
I told you to unlock the door.
Look at me!
Look at Mom!
Don't lock it.
Calvin,
was that naughty to do?
Wow, 'kay.
-  Penny, are you ready?
Wait, take a break!
Good girl!
Okay, are you ready to have some fun?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, come on, Calvin!
Come on bud, you're doing great!
Oh, what is that?
Do you have a rock in your mouth?
Is that a rock?
Is that a rock?
Oh wow.
Sucking on a rock.
Do you want to keep this
for your rock collection?
- Yeah!
- Okay well let me put it in my pocket.
That way you don't have
to hold it in your mouth.
That's yucky.
Let's go!
It is such a beautiful
day, and we all needed
to get out of the house today, huh.
And so we're riding our bikes,
taking Penny for a walk.
And it's beautiful outside today.
It's not that chilly, which
is so surprising for Utah.
Because it's end of November,
it's almost December.
There's no snow, and
it's not even freezing.
It's not even cold.
The kids do not want to wear jackets.
And I'm kind of like, "You
guys should wear jackets."
But they're like, "No way!"
We're pumping iron here!
We're riding our bikes, we're going quick!
We're gettin' the blood flowing,
we're having a good time!
That's what we're doing.
But it's beautiful out here.
I love the blue sky, I love
the mountains, I love my kids,
I love my dog, we're having fun!
- We're going rock hill!
-  We're going to
the rock hill, that's right!
Ready, set,
go!
(hums Lone Ranger theme)
Oh, don't stop.
Keep going!
Ready, set, go!
Aw, crash!
Oh no!
Oh no, he's crashed!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get back up, that's right!
Get back up and try again!
On your mark, get set, go!
(laughs)
- No!
- Ready, set, go!
Oh, he crashed again!
Oh, you crashed too!
Penny, come!
Good girl!
Good girl, Penny!
Good girl!
Careful, go under!
Go under, go under!
There you go.
(Calvin laughing)
(Jackson yelling)
I somehow knew this was gonna happen.
Carrying everything
but I didn't think it
would happen this fast.
Let's go!
(laughs)
(Ellie gasps)
- Oh my gosh, what's going on?
So, I left.
I just got back from activities,
we're back in the bathroom guys.
Today we're in the bathroom,
and I heard Jackson downstairs saying,
"Calvin, hurry hurry hurry!
"You gotta put the seat down!"
And you were helping him get undressed!
To go potty!
Why did you do that?
- Because.
-  Jackson, thank you!
- You're welcome.
- I'm so proud of you!
Thank you!
Were you letting Jackson help you?
Thanks, wow.
(laughs)
I'm shocked, I'm speechless.
I just grabbed the camera
as I was running downstairs.
-  He's going in the toilet!
- Okay!
-  Pop in the toilet.
-  Do you want to go again?
- No.
-  What made you
think he needed to go potty,
did he tell you?
-  Yeah.
- As I was putting Jackson
to bed I seriously had,
one of the sweetest moments with him.
And I feel like I have
a lot of sweet moments.
But I was putting him to
bed and he always asks,
"What was I like as a baby?
"What was daddy like?"
Every night, that's our
routine, and we talk about it.
And he was asking about the baby,
and we ended up talking about how I had
lost the baby before.
And how I said, "And we really are hoping
"that this baby stays strong."
So far this baby's strong
but we're hoping it continues that way.
I've had Ruby and Julie,
they've both have had had ultrasounds
and then a few weeks later
things don't look good, you know.
You just never ever know
but Jackson brought it up.
And he said, and we had talked about
how I had lost the baby before,
and now this baby's
gonna be really strong.
And I said, "Let's say a prayer
"and ask for this baby
to be really strong."
And so we said a prayer.
And it was just so sweet.
And he wanted to say it,
and it was just so sweet.
When Jared and I had
the miscarriage before,
we tried to get a babysitter.
My in-laws were out of town,
no one could watch the kids.
But we didn't want Jackson
and Jared in the waiting room
because then it would be me by myself.
And it wasn't the ideal situation
and I knew that going in,
but it was what it was.
And we were a family and we went in,
and it wasn't very good news.
And Jackson's young.
And it wasn't my favorite
way that I wished that
I would have done things,
but that's how it was.
But it wasn't bad.
It wasn't bad for him to
know that we were excited,
and we lost the baby.
And now I'm pregnant again
and we waited a little bit to tell him.
It's still pretty early but we told him.
I am glad that we are doing it this way.
When my aunt passed away,
Jackson knew Aunt Sonia,
Jackson loved Aunt Sonia.
He loved seeing her.
He would sit on her
lap, she would kiss him,
she would hug him, and when
she passed away, you know,
he's only four so he
doesn't quite grasp it.
But often he has mentioned
about Aunt Sonia and about her.
It's just, you know, it's just..
And so I just really enjoyed having
a very sweet and tender
moment with Jackson,
and for him to remember
that we had lost a baby,
and that he thought about that.
He's just been really cute to me.
Jackson is only four but
I swear his soul is old.
So he's always been a comforter to me.
And Jackson has always
been a comforter to others.
I don't think I ever leave a store
without somebody commenting about Jackson.
Strangers.
Old grandpas.
"What a good boy you are."
It's not a coincidence that
everyone comments about him.
Strangers in public.
He just radiates love.
And I'm so grateful that he's mine.
I'm so grateful that Jared and I
are trusted to have him.
And I'm going to stop boobing,
because no one likes a boob.
And I boob plenty.
People are like, they don't
like me boobin'. (laughs)
But I just wanted to share
this with future Ellie
and future Jackson to look back on.
This is why we vlog, this
is why I do what I do.
I live in the moment and
I capture what I want.
I'm grateful for that.
And I'm grateful that,
not only that I'm able
to share with others,
and I'm so grateful for
everybody's stories.
You all have been so kind.
I've loved hearing your stories.
Especially on Twitter, I've
been really interactive there.
Really appreciate it.
I'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog
and take a bath, relax (chuckles),
drink lots of water because
I'm feeling like I need it.
And I will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
