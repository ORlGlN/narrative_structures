(bright music)
(laughing)
(laughing)
-  Calvin, you
braved the big steps.
Oh my goodness.
(Ellie laughs)
Are you guys having a good morning?
- Yeah.
-  Just playing together?
- Uh-huh.
-  Okay.
Jackson, you look handsome.
Calvin I caught you just in time.
No (laughs).
I'm getting the boys ready
and I had to hurry and
go grab some hair gel.
Jackson likes to get dressed himself
and it is so nice, huh.
I just say, this is your outfit,
get dressed or you go choose an outfit.
So nice, let's do your hair.
Thank you, okay we're good.
We're good, we paid.
Let's go.
- There's a choo choo train.
-  Should we go see it?
- No.
-  No (laughs).
(bright music)
I brought the kids on a day date with me.
I had to go drop some
stuff off with a friend
and I decided to take them to lunch,
then go to the Treehouse Museum.
So this is what I am doing,
is chasing after these
two, room after room.
Calvin is now a police officer
and he's going on a fire run.
And Jackson is in the diner tonight
and he is gonna make
me some lovely dinner.
What are you cookin' tonight?
This is the cutest thing.
We don't come upstairs very much,
when we come here.
Ooh that is so gross.
That feels so gross.
Ah thank you so much.
Oh sorry, we can throw that one away,
it's unsanitary now.
(cash register dings)
Woo!
(cash register dings)
Woo!
(Ellie laughs)
- Three dollars.
-  Oh here.
Will two work?
So here's seven.
That seems fair.
- What's up guys?
Hope you're having a great day.
You know that Ellie is out
with the boys right now.
I've been in my office all morning long.
I've been editing, I've been
working on other things.
I need a break.
So, while Ellie is gone,
I thought of something fun,
that's easy, that's simple,
but I think it'll mean a lot to Ellie
when she gets home.
It's just a little surprise.
So come with me,
guys this is a fun little thing
for most people I think,
I think most girls would like this.
We're gonna do a little
surprise for Ellie,
something small, but I
think it goes a long way.
- See?
Little baby.
See, baby.
-  Are you taking
care of the babies?
- Baby.
Baby hold.
-  Are you gonna
take care of baby too?
Can you believe that this
is what Mommy's gonna have?
- That baby?
- Mommy and Daddy,
we're gonna have a baby.
I didn't even know that
this place was in here.
I just saw Calvin playing
in here, and I was like,
oh this is the hospital area.
Change his diaper, is
that what you're gonna do?
(Ellie laughs)
Too soon, too soon.
So cute.
- Do this, do this.
-  Hello, ex-ray please.
You look strong.
(lively jazzy music)
- So that's what we're doing.
We are writing notes for Ellie.
As soon as she gets home,
she's gonna see these scattered
throughout the house,
strategically placed so that she sees them
throughout the rest of the day.
Just little messages to maker her smile,
to make her feel good,
whether she's having a good day,
a great day or a bad day,
it'll make her feel better.
(lively jazzy music)
-  Oh come get it.
- The next thing we have to do
is destroy the evidence,
make sure she has no idea
where this came from, or
how this even happened.
I've got more here,
I've already set up about
10 or 15 around the house.
You can see there's one right there.
But I'm placing these around the house,
just so she sees them throughout the day.
(bright jazzy music)
(groans)
-  Whoa, you got it.
(Ellie laughs)
You want me to help you a little?
- No no no no no no.
-  You got it?
You independent little thing.
I know you can, but I'm just boosting you.
- No I can do it myself.
-  I just--
- No I want to do it myself.
-  Let me.
-  No!
(Ellie laughs)
- But Jackson, I want to help you.
- Mmm-mmm.
-  You are doing awesome.
You got it all by yourself.
Good job.
You don't need Mama's help, do ya?
- No.
-  But I need a kiss.
You got snot on your nose.
Okay ride away.
Ride away Cal.
- Now that that's done,
I feel like I should probably get out
of my pajamas.
I've literally woke up, gone to work
and now I'm at this point right here.
I should get out of my pajamas,
maybe I should shower.
I should definitely shower Jared.
No joke, this is bad.
Alright, turn that thing on.
Alright, woo!
Good start to the day, right guys?
- I feel like I've been stuck to the couch
for a few hours,
so I should get up.
The boys are quiet downstairs.
I think they're playing?
Um (laughs).
- They're totally playing,
I just checked on 'em.
- Um that or all the toilet paper is like,
they toilet papered the basement.
So we went to Zupas today.
And Zupas is 45 minutes ago,
so when I go, I really love it,
and I used to work at Zupa's
when we first got married.
They have the best soup.
The best soup ever is homemade soup.
But if you go get soup somewhere else,
it's usually not as good.
Like Kneaders, I love their food.
I love their sandwiches,
I love their breakfasts,
but their soup is always very salty
and it just doesn't taste like nice soup,
but Zupas soup is so nice.
So if you guys have a Zupas,
you have to get the mango berry salad,
and you have to get the
Wisconsin cauliflower
mixed with the enchilada chile.
It is so good.
So I got an extra cup to bring home.
But tonight for dinner,
I've been wanting to make some soup.
And did you guys ever eat goulash?
Did you eat goulash growing up?
- Uh kind of, something along--
-  Did you like it?
- Yeah I mean, it was pretty good.
We, our go to thing was--
- Spaghetti.
- No, it was like, Mom,
what was it called?
I can't remember.
- Like a Ragu?
- No.
Minestrone soup.
- What was in it?
- Oh that's yummy.
- Minestrone soup.
- That's yummy.
- That was our go-to.
- My mom would make goulash quite a bit
in the fall and winter.
She'd make soups, but goulash,
I feel like we had more often,
because it didn't take as long as a soup,
like it didn't take hours and hours.
So that's what I'm gonna
make tonight is goulash,
because that sounds really
warm, comforting and nice.
-  Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm getting all my notes.
-  Your notes?
(Jared laughs)
Your notes?
Whose notes are they?
- Mine.
-  Okay, well tell me what it says.
- It says poo poo in the toilet.
-  Oh yeah it does.
Let's see what this one says.
You are a great mom.
You're right, it is for you Jackson.
-  You are a great mom.
-  You are a great mom.
I think you should get some tips okay?
(Jared laughs)
- I'm gonna get notes.
(stool sliding)
- Notes?
Get notes.
-  Are you getting
notes that Daddy put
all over the house?
- Yeah.
-  Are they for you or me?
- You.
I'm taking it down for you.
-  Thanks.
(running steps)
-  See the note.
- Okay.
But I can't reach.
I need something to stand on.
- No.
See.
- Let's go find some more notes.
There's one!
- Oh yeah!
- Now just find a way out down.
-  Wow, you guys got 'em all.
That was so cute.
-  Not all.
-  Not all, there's more?
- Last big one.
Right--
(Ellie gasps)
-  There.
I'll grab that one.
First let's turn the lights on.
Here we go.
Wow.
Well Jared, you're cute.
- Thank you.
- I've got my bell peppers cut up,
my onions cut, the water's boiling.
I have not been eating
meat the last few weeks,
but I am gonna put a little bit
of ground meat in it, because that kind of
helps the flavor, but I probably
won't eat very much of it,
because it hasn't tasted good to me.
- I forgot, the one
that says you are cute.
- Oh where?
- You told me I was cute.
- And I forgot to write that down.
-  Oh boo.
You're cute.
That was fun to come home to,
and it entertained the
kids for like an hour.
- I know they were looking
all over the place.
Jackson's like I want
to look in the garage.
And I was like, I promise
you, there's not one--
There is one in the garage.
Oh shoot.
- Is there?
- It was the first one you saw.
- Jared cleaned his office
while we were gone today
and he put our ultrasound
picture right here,
which is so cute.
I've showed this to you before,
my friend, my neighbor
gave this to me in May,
when we miscarried,
and I have been so grateful
and proud of myself
that I kept it alive,
and I think that that's so cute together.
Aw the last one.
- I found it.
- Here you go Pen.
(laughing)
Sometimes when we are cooking
and when we're eating,
we will have Penny on a leash inside,
just to kind of like teach her,
and keep her away from
jumping, she kinda hasn't,
she still has, but jumping and like
being around the food and stuff so.
- The thing is, Penny is still a puppy
and she still does puppy things.
-  Yes you are.
- And she's not gonna
be 100% in everything
we're teaching her, even
though what we do teach her,
she does it really well so.
- Yeah.
But I've actually liked,
like when we eat dinner,
we'll sit here and eat dinner,
we'll put her pillow right here,
and we'll put the leash on the ground
with her pillow
and she's been really good to just stay
and I've really enjoyed having her around.
But it's been nice that she's not jumping,
because no one no one
wants to eat my food,
because if you eat my food, girl,
I'm not gonna be as happy
as I was a few months ago.
-  Well and you
don't want to eat her food.
- I would be angry.
And your food's gross.
Um Bonnie made me eat the dog's
dog food when I was little.
- Oh my brothers made me do that too.
Okay what older sibling hasn't done that
to a younger sibling?
-  Did they tell
you it was Cocoa Puffs?
- I don't know, I think
they just dared me to do it,
so I guess I had a choice.
- Yeah, they put milk in it,
they said it was Cocoa Puffs.
-  Awww.
- And of course I knew, but I took a bite,
and I'm like eww, got 'em to laugh
and then got Cocoa Puffs.
- That's what you like to do,
you just like to make people laugh.
I remember in college,
we had like three meals that we would eat
over and over again.
One was peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,
sometimes tuna fish sandwiches.
- Loved tuna.
- I saw it at the grocery
store today and I was like,
oh I'm craving that.
- Me and you haven't had
a tuna sandwich in years.
- It's been awhile.
- We loved eating that.
- We would have, like sometimes
we'd have like chicken
breasts and goulash.
And that's what we're eating tonight.
We had goulash so much,
because it's cheap and it's good,
that I got sick of it.
There's a few of the meals
that we had over and over again
that I feel like I couldn't
do for the rest of my life,
but some that I could.
Tuna fish sandwiches are
definitely one of the ones
that I could.
Peanut butter and jelly I
think I would get sick of
and maybe goulash.
Yeah goulash, because I
did get sick of goulash,
but I think I could have
tuna fish sandwiches
every day for the rest of my life
and be totally fine.
-  Tuna fish with pickles.
- Oh yeah with little relish things.
And toasted bread and potato chips.
You gotta have the potato chips,
sometimes you just sprinkle it on there,
put it in the sandwich, and
sometimes you just eat it.
- No we got so sick of
peanut butter and jelly
that we went to tuna fish,
and that was like a huge step up.
- That was so nice.
- It was awesome.
-  I miss college days, don't you?
- We had fun.
One time we got into bed at 11 o'clock
and we sat there and I was like,
Jared, we should go get Taco Bell.
So we got in the car at 11 at night
and went and got Taco Bell,
and went home and went right to bed.
- Yeah yep, because we didn't have kids,
so we could do that stuff.
- It was fun.
-  It was fun.
- And when we got locked out.
-  Oh my gosh.
- And we had to like,
it was like midnight, and the
person with the extra key,
you can't knock after midnight.
- It was after hours, yeah.
And we went to the John Mayer concert,
my buddy Nick got us concerts.
- And I was mad that night,
I felt bad, I do remember.
-  Why were you mad?
- Oh I should've just lightened up,
but it was cold, and I was
like, why did we lose the key?
- Oh after the fact, after the fact.
Well yeah, you were locked out
and it's freezing cold,
I can see why you would get mad.
So what we did, is we kicked
out the air conditioning unit
in the window.
(Ellie laughs)
I sliced my hand open and
was bleeding everywhere,
but we finally got in.
Oh my gosh.
I still remember cutting
myself on the air conditioner.
Oh it hurt so bad.
- Yeah.
(bright jazzy music)
-  I did poo.
-  What?
- I did poo poo.
-  Did you go poo?
- See?
-  (laughs) I want to see.
(Jared laughs)
- I seriously was like--
(toilet flushes)
(laughing)
-  Good job.
- I was like get in bed.
Of course that's what every parent does,
like 10 times when they
put their kids to bed.
Or at least us.
And he's like I pooed.
And I was like did you go poo?
'Cause every time he goes poo,
it's like let's sit on the toilet.
But this time you waited.
-  You waited to go poo, huh?
You are so proud of himself,
I could hear him talking downstairs
when I was putting Calvin to bed.
- Jackson.
- I poo.
I poo.
- And the thing with Calvin is,
he's totally ready to
start potty training.
He's been loving it.
He's been warmed up to it
for well over two months.
-  Yeah.
- But I've been thinking,
do I start it now?
Do I start working on him now?
Or do I wait until, do I wait a month,
and wait until January, so
it's like the busyness is done,
because it's like
- Yeah.
- for a good little bit,
and so I don't know.
I think he'll be just as good
in a month to start or now.
I just wonder.
-  I think if we
just do a little here,
a little there.
- Yeah.
-  Kinda ease him into it a little.
- I just definitely don't want
to push him into it.
I feel like Jackson did
such a good job with peeing.
-  Mmm-hmm.
- He had a really hard time,
like pooping was a struggle for him.
We saw lots of doctor appointments,
he had bad constipation issues,
but when we worked through those,
now he's a champ.
-  (laughs) What he
said when he flushes it.
- Every time he flushes, bye
bye poop, I'll miss you (kiss).
And then he flushes.
- And flushes it.
- It is the funniest thing,
and I have no idea where he got that from.
We certainly don't do that Ellie.
- No we don't.
-  Goodnight.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I got out of my pajamas today,
so it was a good day.
Thanks for watching guys
and we'll see you next time.
Bye.
