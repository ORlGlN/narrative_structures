- There you go. All ready.
-  What in the world?
Is this like some
Mission Impossible stuff?
- Cheers.
- I don't know if I get
mad or if I just hug him
and be grateful.
(upbeat music)
Come here, mister.
K, let's do your hair.
Look in the mirror.
All ready for preschool.
- I don't need this hair band.
- There you go. All ready.
- I don't need it.
- You don't need it?
- No.
- I like it.
It keeps the hair out of your eyes.
Should we just do it
like we usually do it?
- Yes.
(laughs)
- I'm just kidding, Jackson.
We're not putting a ponytail in your hair.
We'll do hair gel like we always do.
Jackson asked me what
a ponytail was today,
so that's why I did that.
(pleasant music)
Ready? All done?
- Yes!
- Today, I dropped Jackson off at school,
and he totally did not look back.
He was so excited to go,
and we are taking Miss
Penny on a walk and Calvin.
I was gonna call you Jackson.
Can I hold your hand?
Can I hold your hand?
This is his way of saying no.
He put his hands in his
pocket, you little stinker.
Look at the bees.
Isn't that cool?
(baby talking)
You don't wanna touch.
We'll just look.
It's so pretty.
(baby talking)
Can you hold my hand now?
Let me see your swole.
- What?
-  Let me see it.
-  Oh, geez.
-  I just had a baby.
(laughs)
- That was easy.
- It was easy.
Just came right on out.
- And for only 19.95,
you can make it easy too.
-  K, let me see your arms.
- Oh my gosh, k.
-  Look, you did so good today.
- Okay, here's the thing.
I just finished my workout before we--
-  You just had a baby too!
- Oh, that was easy!
If you're a male and wanna have a baby
for only one, low, easy payment of 19.95,
we can make it happen for you.
Just kidding.
That's biological.
I can't get into that for legal reasons.
-  Oh my.
- Anyway, so I did my workout,
and ever since I was a kid
like in high school doing bench press
or pushups and everything, the left side
of my pecs activate
more than my right side,
and it bothers me that, when
I do a pushup, I feel it,
right up in here.
I can feel this one is building--
-  But that's your
left side, which is weird.
- Yeah, and I'm right-handed,
and this side doesn't,
and I've never stopped to ask why.
I've just worked out, and--
-  It's weird.
- It bothers me now,
'cause I can feel like,
if I flex my pec, I can feel
it more on the left side.
- I don't really know if
I feel that difference.
- Let me check yours just in case.
- Woohoo, we're done with preschool.
Jackson enjoyed his other day,
his second day at preschool.
You were so cute when I picked you up,
just playing with your friends.
I have to run into town.
We're doing family pictures.
I just wanna see if I can find something.
- We does color in watering cans.
- And what did you wanna do
while we were at the mall?
- To slide on the floor.
- His request was to go
eat at Pretzel Maker.
Should we go get a pretzel?
- Yes.
Cheers!
- This is the face you
get when you find out
there's no toys in the
stores we're going into.
Sorry, we're just looking at
clothes for family pictures.
Lame, lame, lame.
It's never fun,
but at least you'll
look good for pictures.
Don't be a stinker.
Dance, dance, dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance.
This is the best date.
Why is this the best date?
- Because it is.
- Because you got gum out
of the gumball machine.
Are you gonna help me find a dress?
K, you dance really cute,
'cause that makes me happy.
So cute.
All right-y, I'm gonna
try and be a little quiet,
'cause Calvin is asleep on my
bed, but I wanna show you guys
what I have for family pictures.
We're doing pictures to
update everything again.
We did pictures one year
ago, and it's crazy how fast
it's like our kids are changed.
We're doing family pictures again.
It's been kinda hard to
put outfits together,
'cause I've wanted a little bit more color
in this year's pictures.
If it's totally out of
whack, you could tell me,
and I won't be offended,
but the boys are gonna have
matching shoes, and they
have mustard yellow pants.
Jackson's wearing navy blue.
This is what I think Calvin's gonna wear,
and then this is what I
found today at The Balm.
I went into the store, and I
told the lady at the store,
I said, "Thank you so much
for being so nice to me,"
because sometimes I leave
specifically that store,
and I feel a little intimidated
or just a little bombarded
sometimes, and she was so
helpful, and she just walked me
around the store,
grabbed a bunch of stuff.
She's like, "This'll look
good with mustard yellow.
"This'll look good," and she was so cute.
So, so glad that I found this,
and I would totally never
have picked this up,
because I usually don't
wear dresses like this,
because sometimes I feel
a little funny in them,
because it's so loose and long,
and I don't know if it's
very flattering on me,
but I tried it on, and I liked it,
so hopefully I'll continue
to like it next week
when we do pictures.
Now, I just need to find
something for Jared,
and he just got some new
shirts, so we'll have to look
to see what he has for this.
So fun!
What is so crazy to me is
Jackson is in a shoe size eight,
and Calvin is in a shoe size seven,
and I think it's crazy
that they pretty much
are like right there on the same size.
It's weird to put Calvin
in a big pair of shoes.
That's Calvin's feet.
That's so crazy.
I got these at Old Navy, and
these are some new fall clothes
for them as well.
They'll wear these to church, so so fun.
Can't wait to get family pictures done.
- What in the world?
Is this like some Mission
Impossible stuff that you guys
have going on here?
Don't you know you could open that gate?
What are you boys doing?
Are you guys going on an adventure?
(laughs)
-  I don't wanna go.
- Are you opening it for me,
because you know my belly's too big?
I know! I'm working on it, okay?
I'm working on it.
A friend of ours is working
with a local high school here,
and they're raising money
for their football team,
and he asked me if we had
anything that we could donate
for the football team for a
silent auction and everything.
I was like, I think I can
come up with some cool things
for that, so I wanna show you.
We've got the custom Ellie
and Jared shirt here,
the camera logo, the Ellie
and Jared circle logo
that everyone knows and
loves, and I threw in a couple
GoPros for this silent
auction, fundraiser thing.
I'm excited to do that.
It feels cool to be part of
the community and everything,
and they have all of these events,
like the thing that my
dad played jazz band for.
I want to be a part of those things,
and I want to help with the
community around the area,
and this is like a fun way
to get started with that.
I've got these shirts that we can give,
and the GoPros, I think, is
a fun addition to give too.
We leave for Los Angeles
early tomorrow morning,
and we have so much to do to
get ready for that tonight,
but I figured we'd let
the boys play a little bit
and then get down to business.
Let's cue the play montage.
(funk music)
- Baby, I'm home.
-  Oh my gosh, Ellie.
- It must be a big difference,
'cause Jared literally
hung up the phone when I walked in.
-  Yeah, I hung up the phone.
I was talking with Joel.
- You could tell a difference?
- Oh my gosh.
-  Yeah, you like it?
- Yes, El, it looks great, Ellie.
- Aw, thanks.
-  The blond is not, like--
- It's cooler.
-  Yeah, it's cooler.
I was gonna say it's not platinum blond,
but it's like a dirty blond.
- Thank you.
Do you guys remember
forever ago when I went
to the wrong person to get my hair done?
I missed the address.
Anyway, Jared had called her and was like,
"Please get my wife in".
We never heard anything.
I have been scheduled with not that lady,
but this lady for months to get in,
and today she did it, and
she did such a good job.
-  It looks great.
Give me another spin.
- I told her she's my new best friend.
-  Ellie--
- She cut a few inches and colored it.
-  Yeah, it's a lot
shorter, and it's colored.
- Thank you.
- It looks just very, okay,
my terminology with hair--
- I'll say it.
- I have no idea what I'm
talk, looks really healthy.
- It does. Thank you.
- It looks really good, Ellie.
I'm really happy for you.
- Well, thanks.
Jared is very happy for me
when I go get stuff done
for myself, like extra nice,
and it makes me feel good
as a mom and as a wife.
Thank you.
- Well, you deserve it.
- I thought we were gonna
do a little hair haul.
- Yes, I just noticed that I
have this on my nose still.
-  I know.
- From my Instagram post.
That's a heart on my
nose, if you can't tell.
- My first haul is 100
Tootsie Roll wrappers.
When I checked out, I was like
I'm gonna eat all of these
while they check me out.
- I'm glad you didn't save me
any, because I'm working hard.
- I ate a lot.
I always use some purple shampoo.
Every other time I wash my
hair, I'll use a purple shampoo,
but she said to use a
purple conditioner, so I got
Bumble and bumble tone enhancer
cool purple conditioner,
and then I got one other
thing that she used.
It's called Oribe is the brand.
It's royal blowout.
It's just supposed to help
make your hair dry faster
and be silky and smooth.
That's my hair haul.
-  That's a cool little haul.
- Do you like it?
-  Yeah, it looks great.
- Well, thanks, Jar.
-  Jackson, do you notice
anything different about mom?
- Do I look different?
- Yeah.
-  What happened to mom?
- Haircut.
- Yeah!
(laughs)
Okay, guys, if you want
major, major brownie points
with your partner, spouse,
husband, wife, or anything,
especially the wives, notice
when they do something.
If you notice that
their hair is different,
their eyebrows are different,
their mascara's different,
their makeup is different--
- You're cute.
- You will get major
brownie points for noticing.
- You're cute.
You just want me to kiss you.
- It gives me the motivation I need.
(laughs)
- I like Penny the best when we're eating,
because she sits right
here, and she just waits,
and she just sits the
whole time I'm eating.
Penny, are you ready?
You've been such a good girl.
You can see.
Is that soft?
Soft.
Good girl.
It's my favorite.
When we eat, she just stares and sits.
-  Yeah, she's a good girl.
-  She just stops
moving for a minute.
-  Freeze!
- Now, the rest is for me.
Go away!
I just had the strongest
feeling to check on Calvin,
and I'm out of breath now.
I was just thinking.
I was like, "I need to check on Calvin,"
and I walked in his room, and he was gone,
and he walked out the front door.
He was outside,
and I don't know if I get
mad or if I just hug him
and be grateful.
I don't even know what to do.
I'm gonna get mad, though.
You don't go outside.
Calvin, I don't even know what to do.
Calvin, that's naughty.
Don't you go outside.
K, we're gonna go to bed.
We don't open doors.
That was naughty, and flipping worried,
like what the heck?
He knows how to unlock doors.
He knows how to open doors.
That was really scary with Calvin leaving,
especially with him
waking up at three A.M.
and going downstairs, playing with toys
that you guys saw yesterday.
Like I said, I didn't
know if I should be mad,
or if I should hold him,
or if I should do both
before I put him to bed.
I definitely was firm and
had him look at the door
and say that was naughty.
We have an alarm system, and
the door, everything chimes
if a door or window opens,
but we're gonna turn that volume up,
I'm gonna get a baby lock
and put it on the front door,
so, if he tries to open it,
he can take baby locks off,
but it takes him a long time to do that.
I'm gonna do that, and then
I think we might even have
the alarm set even while we're home
if the door's open type of thing
just so we can get this
under wraps for a minute.
Calvin's getting into
an adventurous stage,
and I think that that's
the steps we need to take.
Jackson was never like
this, and he still isn't.
He asks if he wants to go outside.
He doesn't just go outside.
Today, he asked if he could
go to his friend's house,
and I said no, it was time for bed,
and it's just interesting.
Each kid is interesting,
and this is a new experience
that just happened that
I have to take some steps
to figure that out.
Crazy. Thank you guys
so much for watching.
Parenting is so fun yet so hard.
I think I totally have
to add one more thing,
because this is such a big deal.
I really want people to know
that I'm taking it seriously.
Usually, at night, Calvin falls
asleep with the door open.
He falls asleep really
well if the door's open,
and then, before we go
to bed, we close it,
and he does have a baby lock on there,
so, if he ever does get
up, we can hear him,
because it takes him forever
to get that lock off,
but, that night that he
woke up and was playing,
we forgot to close the door.
Again, his door is closed with a lock.
It's just, there's just so many things,
and I wanna express
everything, 'cause sometimes
you miss little bits,
and it's just a big deal,
and it worries me that he was out there,
and I was very, my
stomach's kind of in knots
because of it.
Anyway, he's in bed.
He's safe.
I'm going to bed.
We will see you guys on Saturday.
We will have everything in the description
if you guys wanna come see us in L.A.,
and we'll see you guys later.
This mama's going to bed.
Doors are locked, alarm is
on, and I'm going to bed.
See you, bye.
