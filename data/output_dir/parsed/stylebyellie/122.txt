(upbeat music)
-  Are you ready for this?
Hey.
- Garland, wreath?
- Wreath, garland, whatever
the crap that think is called.
Ellie it has been here far too long,
so I have a wonderful idea.
Would you accompany me with this?
- Christmas music?
- Hey Google, play some
holiday music for us.
-  Sure, here's
a Google play music station
called feel good classic cottage rock.
(laughing)
- That wasn't what you asked.
- Let's try that one more time.
(festive jazzy music)
There we go.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Let's show Daddy our dance.
♪ Oh the weather outside is frightful ♪
Shake your hips.
♪ But the fire is so delightful. ♪
(Calvin fusses)
-  Did you just hip check him,
because you wanted him to move his hips?
♪ Let it snow, let it snow let it snow ♪
- Okay, show him your dance.
-  C'mon let's dance Cal.
♪ And I brought some corn for poppin' ♪
♪ Lights are turned down low ♪
♪ Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ♪
♪ When we finally kiss goodnight ♪
- Come here.
(laughs)
Just a minute, I'm prepping him.
(Jared laughing)
You ready?
Let's do it together.
- No.
♪ Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ♪
-  Dance Calvin, dance.
♪ The thing they love
is sittin' by the fire ♪
- Aww.
- Aww, party pooper.
- That's alright, there's only room
in this party for two.
- I told him.
♪ Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ♪
♪ Ooh wee, 'cause it's snowing ♪
- I can't believe you told him that.
(snapping fingers)
♪ Let it snow, let it snow ♪
(Ellie laughs)
- Okay, let's put
the garland up.
- Let's do it.
(bright holiday music)
- I am not Scrooge, I am not the Grinch,
but there's a couple Christmas songs
that I just cannot stand.
And if you're listening closely,
it's playing in the background right now.
I love Paul McCartney.
♪ Sing their song ♪
("Wonderful Christmastime" playing)
The reason I can't stand this song,
is it's very petty, it's very lame,
but it got to the burning of my soul
and just incinerated it to death!
I worked at Red Robin
when I was in high school
for three years,
and every Christmas, they
have the Christmas album,
and it's the same 15 Christmas songs.
But it always seemed like every other
Christmas song was this Paul
McCartney Christmas song.
And I can't handle it anymore.
It has stained this song for me forever
and every time it comes on,
I cringe and I weep for my soul
and I try and hit the next button
as fast as I can.
But on the other hand,
this is one of Ellie's
favorite Christmas songs.
So I'm so conflicted.
- You will like it and you will play it.
(Jared laughs)
-  Do you have any Christmas songs
that you just hate?
- No.
No.
- No, 'cause you're an angel.
- I really like Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
-  Yeah, do you want to know why?
- Why?
- Because you're an angel Ellie.
You're a freaking angel,
that doesn't hate anything of course.
Do you have any Christmas songs
that you just can't stand anymore?
Let me know in the comments down below.
(bright Christmas music)
-  The garland is done.
We had one piece left,
so we put it under this.
Yay, it's feeling so
festive in here, arrr!
(laughs)
-  It's so festive,
I could kill, aye!
- I just love it.
Hey Calvin,
- Hey Mommy.
- Hey, Calvin, this is,
he loves to move the bar stools all around
and he always barricades himself in.
And he also runs and hides under there,
when he's in trouble.
What did he, what has
he been getting trouble
What has he been getting in trouble?
What?
- For.
- What has he been getting
What has he?
(laughing)
What has he been getting
in trouble for a lot is,
he loves the soap dispenser
and then we have bath soap
in my bathroom that's a soap dispenser
and then I have lip gloss
that's kind of like a dispenser.
(sighs)
- Anything with a push down.
- I think today, I've had to get upset
with him a few times,
and I've had to clean
up tons of his messes
and that's where he runs to hide, as well.
-  Look, he's made
himself a half circle.
-  I'm gonna get you.
(Calvin laughs)
Yeah, you better hide.
- Ahhhh!
-  You see that
lipstick on your face,
that you put on your face?
That was mine and you put it on my bed
and it's like I've been with the kids,
it's not like I'm not watching them,
like I was folding laundry,
it's those two seconds that you're not
eyeballs on them the whole time,
that he's destructive.
I don't know, I was
literally putting socks away
and he was right by me.
- And you know what?
That's the thing though is like,
we're doing the best we can.
And you need to remember that,
you are doing the best you can.
-  Oh yeah.
- These things happen.
- Crap happens.
- It was so funny hearing
stories about my brother.
He knocked down the
Christmas tree one year.
He was hanging on a fence one time
and Ruby had pulled him down,
he was like Jackson's age,
maybe even younger,
totally split his lip open.
Jared has a cousin, she's always telling
the funniest, but like, it's not funny
in the moment stories of her little boy
doing things, it's like--
- Get a close up of his lipstick.
Can you show us your lipstick?
-  Is that my purple lipstick?
Did you try eating it?
We're good?
- Are you good?
-  Gosh.
(Calvin laughs)
- Ooh Mom took it.
Say bye Mom.
-  Should've danced.
- Oh that's right.
You should've danced.
- Okay, do you want it?
- So you want to dance?
- Calvin do you want it?
-  Let's dance.
-  Okay you gotta dance.
-  No.
("Little Drummer Boy" playing)
-  Dance first.
Shake your hips.
Look at that face, he's
like leave me alone.
(Ellie laughing)

Get your rumpabumbum away from here.
That hallway right there,
I want to put pictures one above
and under, one all along the hallway.
- Can I put my plant back?
- So we're gonna put,
we gotta find pictures
to put in the frames.
- Can I take my plant back now?
-  Yeah please do.
- This is my office plant
for my office, thank you.
-  Here Calvin, I
want to ask you something.
Don't tell me what letter this is,
I'm gonna see if Calvin knows, okay?
Okay, Calvin, Calvin,
do you know what letter that is?
- E.
- E.
We've been going over his letters everyday
and it's been been fun, because
Calvin will repeat them,
and usually even, he usually doesn't say
every single one of them is E,
but when he actually sees E,
he knows that it's E, so
I thought that was funny.
I am very impressed
with your handwriting skills, Mr. J.
Is this fun for you to do,
or is it work?
- Work.
-  It's work?
Hmmm, I thought that it would be fun.
You seemed to be excited to do it.
- I missed one, B.
- I've got a game in mind,
that we're all gonna play
together as a family.
Does that sound good?
- What is it?
What was it?
-  Do you want to know?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Okay, let me go get
it, and we'll get ready,
and then we'll play it, okay?
- I need to finish my letters.
- His eyebrows
-  are everything right now.
- Mine?
- His?
- What, his.
- I need time to finish my letters first.
-  Okay, finish your letters.
How fun is that, he wants
to do his homework first.
Like how cute.
His eyebrows were like
Alright ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,
who's ready to play a game?
- Me.
(Ellie laughs)
- The name is Larry
Culpepper and I don't lose.
Alright?
I've got my fanny pack,
I've got my headphones,
I've got my all-access pass.
All-access means all the time.
-  Are you ready to play?
Does Daddy look funny?
- Yeah.
-  Alright what's the game?
- Wait first, where's the Dr. Pepper?
(Ellie laughs)
- Jackson loves surprises and games
and he always closes his eyes,
so he can be really surprised.
He loves surprises.
And these are our little markers
that we're gonna put on our paper.
Where's the paper?
- You know what?
- I forgot.
I got my Dr. Pepper right here.
Let me go get the papers,
name's Larry Culpepper.
It is an honor to be playing this game
with you guys here.
-  What?
-  The lighting looks so yellow.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
I'm Larry Culpepper,
-  Here Cal.
- the greatest Dr. Pepper
fan there ever has been
and ever will be.
Do you know that?
- Yeah.
- You want to try my glasses?
I wanted to wear this for Halloween.
Guess what, so here's the story.
So I was streaming on Twitch the other day
and I was streaming as Larry Culpepper.
I had the costume on and everything,
and it was so funny.
And the story is, I got this costume
because I tweeted about it
and Dr. Pepper sent it to me.
This is the power of the internet.
And how awesome Dr. Pepper is.
(laughing)
- It is Thanksgiving week.
We are wanting to get into the spirit.
We are playing some bingo.
(Calvin yells)
The kids love,
this is their favorite thing,
is that when we sit down
and play games with them
and bingo's fun.
- Yeah, especially when
your markers are edible.
-  Okay.
-  Alright first
one ladies and gentlemen,
we've got a turkey.
Yeah, good job Calvin,
put it in your free spot.
-  Turkey, do you have a turkey?
I don't have a turkey.
-  You don't have a turkey?
Yes you have a little turkey.
Wait, let me see your turkey Ellie.
Sorry, uncooked turkey.
(laughing)
- Gobble gobble gobble.
- Oh.
Uncooked turkey.
- I want a turkey.
-  Oh that's a turkey.
- That's kind of sad that
we have to specify that.
Let's go with hay.
- I have hay, I have hay.
-  You have hay?
-  Yep.
-  Let's see, hay, okay,
I'm one away on this one.
Jackson, do you have five in a row?
What do you say?
- I missed it.
- Bingo!
- Yay, Jackson got a bingo.
- Let's see.
- You do have bingo.
-  Yay, you win a prize.
- He always get the
first bingo, high five.
-  Where were you
on the Disney cruise dude?
- I know, we could've
won done those dollars.
Do you have a box of apples Calvin?
- Oh I have a box of apples.
-  Box of apples.
Let's see where you put it.
Do you have apples on there?
Right there.
So we called them
and you got all of them by yourself
in the right spot.
- I got three and a half.
-  Okay, pumpkin, orange pumpkin.
-  Oh I have an orange pumpkin.
-  Good job Calvin.
-  Did he get a bingo?
-  Not quite yet, good job.
You're gonna go get our dinner?
- Yeah, I gotta grab my wallet though.
- He's going that way.
We invited Jared's parents for dinner
tonight for Thanksgiving.
We are gonna be at my
parents house this year,
so we're gonna do a
little hangout tonight and
I figured
- It's pre-Thanksgiving.
- Rememer when Calvin
wouldn't dance earlier?
I'm gonna get him.
(blowing recorder)
(laughing)
- Bye.
Ta-da.
(bright jazzy music)
(Ellie laughs)
-  He throws a beat.
Yay Calvin.
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
(Ellie laughs)
(bright jazzy music)
-  Alright.
- What's going on?
-  Are you being silly?
Oh he's silly and naked.
Oh he's got a diaper on, we're okay.
(Calvin fusses)
- He was naked and then
he goes to your mom.
-  Calvin can you come
say goodnight to Grandpa?
(kiss)
- Calvin, do you want to know something?
Do you know what my grandpa would do
to me all the time.
And I don't know if I'll
ever be able to do this.
Is my grandpa would give me hugs
and he would rub his cheek on mine
and it would sting so bad
from the whiskers.
He would just have such sharp whiskers.
And I think that's what
happened when he hugged you,
is like he was like ow.
- Ow.
-  Did that hurt?
Ready set
- Hold him down
- while I
- Tickle, tickle,
-  tickle, tickle.
- Good night, love you.
- Love you.
- Too.
- You know how we were talking
about biggest pet peeves the other day?
- Yes, tell me more.
- I've notice with vlogging,
people hate when people chew food.
I stopped chewing gum forever ago.
And that is annoying.
And you don't think it's annoying,
until you watch someone.
I agree, it's annoying.
You know what else is annoying?
- What?
- Picking or touching at your lip.
I am so mad at myself,
I just watch our video
that's gonna go up tomorrow
and I was like, I wish
Jared could cut those out
but he can't cut those out,
or the whole video will be cut out.
I licked my lip 1,000 times,
and I just thought, I already
know all of the comments
are gonna be, and I
already know how I feel.
I just annoyed a thousand people.
I just pissed off a thousand people.
You do things that you don't even realize
that you do.
Filming myself for four years
and watching myself, I have learned
that I say things differently,
some of which I'm not
changing because I love it.
I lick my, I'm so mad.
- You've got a cold sore,
and you're addressing it.
- But I can't help it.
- Even if someone if someone was like,
ew, you should do that, don't do that,
I can't help it.
It's just there, and I just
do that 1,000 times a day.
- You know what's funny though?
- I'm so annoyed with myself.
- I edited that video,
and we had 10 minutes
of footage in that spot,
and I never noticed it.
- Well I'm glad you didn't,
but the whole time I was like oh Ellie.
And when we did that food video.
- Yeah.
- The taste challenge.
I didn't look at those
comments for like a week later.
Life got crazy, but I ended up going back
and like looking at it,
and I was like uulll.
And I didn't watch that video
and then when I watched it,
oh that, I was really
smacky and annoying,
(Jared smacks)
but when I'm talking and eating,
you don't even put the two together.
- You just don't even think about it.
- And I was like oh Ellie.
There's so many things that we do
that I've improved on,
and so many things that I have more to do.
But that's one thing
I love about the vlog,
I feel like I've become a better person,
because I've actually been able
to watch myself grow,
is that the weirdest thing in the world?
- No.
- Even if you guys don't want a vlog,
like even if you don't upload,
I really truly challenge you
to do it on your phone four times a day.
Film a little clip.
Just try.
It'll break you out of your shell,
even if you don't think you have a shell.
It'll break you out.
You'll be able to look at
yourself and you will be able
to see things that you
like about yourself.
You'll be able to see
things you don't like
about yourself, that you want to change.
It is the most bizarre thing
that you don't even realize
until you do it.
- Right.
- Half the times, like I'll say something
that totally didn't make sneeze,
sounded dumb--
- But in your head it makes sense.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Yeah.
- It's weird.
So first, I'm sorry about
all the lip licking.
I annoyed the crud out of myself,
let alone I can't image how
people are gonna feel with that.
Anyway--
- Wait, real quick.
- That was my spiel.
- So that makes me wonder,
what quirks do I have, like on the video,
what do I do that you're like oh Jared.
- Maybe this?
- Do I do this a lot?
- I think you grab your hair, but
- Well it's just really fun to touch.
- But I don't think it's a big quirk,
but I do think you touch it.
I've tried to make a mental note,
to not like, and I just did.
I've made a mental note to myself
to not grab my hair,
because it is flustering
watching a video and the whole time
the girl's looking like--
- Or.
- I really try, I know, I know,
I know, I know.
None of us are perfect.
We just need to know that.
(laughs)
I really am annoyed with myself though.
I'm gonna be better.
Okay, thank you guys for watching.
We had a great day with the kids.
- Your hair gets caught in my whiskers.
- Just eat my hair.
Penny was a good girl today.
- She was so sweet today.
- She was good.
I don't know why I said
that, it's just been fun.
- Tomorrow is her on year anniversary
of being a Mecham family
member, part of the Mecham clan.
- Can't wait, bye.
- Have a wonderful day.
- Bye.
