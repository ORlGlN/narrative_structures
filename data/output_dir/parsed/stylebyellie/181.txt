-  It was a day of healing.
(light, peaceful music)
-  Life throws curve balls at us,
and we never know what we're gonna get.
(slow, peaceful music)
How much do you love me?
- A lot.
- Do you love me so much?
- You're smiling, so I
don't know what's up.
-  Just look here real quick, 'k?
-  It's gonna make me beautiful?
(gasping)
-  Ellie, I did it.
You have curly eyebrows,
or wavy.
- They're actually kinda cute.
(Jared laughing)
-  Thanks Snapchat!
-  I don't know
what I love watching more,
the two little ones running
wild in the backyard,
climbing rocks, eating snacks, Lincoln.
(giggling)
What are you doin'?
Or Penny bein' so happy.
- You're crazy.
-  She just chased
a butterfly and it,
I think, made our entire week.
(both laughing)
When she gets excited she just goes crazy.
(slow, peaceful music)
- Today is recovery day
number two for Ellie,
and I've made very strict rules for her
not to lift her fingers too much,
that is enforced by me and
a little bit of the doctor,
but she's not following
those rules very well.
She's been doing laundry and I'm like
Ellie, I will do that, I
promise, let me get to that,
just hang out and rest.
One of the things that we wanna
do while she's resting is,
Joel and the kids and
Bonnie are over here,
and we have this giant painting
that Ellie's friend painted for us,
and we're gonna hang it up on this wall.
That's gonna be difficult because
this ground is not even,
and it's a giant painting.
Luckily we have an expandable ladder
that should help a huge part of that,
so this may be great,
this may be terrible,
but some way or another
it's gonna be done.
I've got Joel at my side so
I think it's gonna be okay.
- We'll get it, broken
banister or not, we'll get it.
(Calvin panting)
(Ellie giggling)
-  My cousin made me a
whole batch of cinnamon rolls,
and this is probably my sixth
one in the last three days,
love it.
That looks great.
- Okay,
so this is the top and the bottom-ish,
does that feel like good height?
-  I would rather
have it lower than we think,
just because everything
else is always lower
than I think in the house,
and that's how we were taught.
- And it's better.
- And we are pretty short.
-  Yeah, but it's a huge painting,
that looks good right there.
- Okay, are you sure
you want this painting?
- Yes.
- 'K, 'cause once I drill this
there's no goin' back.
- That's okay.
- 'K.
Now are you sure, is there anything?
- I want it up there.
- Yeah, but do you want me
to do this or do you want Joel to do it?
- Well, I don't know.
- Ellie come on,
we're gonna do it, okay?
- Okay do it,
it's taken two hours.
-  That seems very to-the-side.
-  Hey, your
commentary is not necessary.
-  That didn't
feel like a stud at all.
-  Well that's why I was like, uh.
- Joel did the measurements.
- I did the math, Jared
put 'em on the wall.
(laughing)
There could be a mistranslation somewhere.
- Let's take a look at this,
we're gonna regroup for
a second, hold please.
- Back to the drawing board.
(light, peaceful music)
- I felt like that was
Michelangelo's painting,
The Father and the Son.
-  Hold, hold.
I like your, uh,
-  Power stance?
-  (laughing) Yeah,
your figure, it's really good.
(laughing)
(power drill grinding)
- Hey.
- Nice.
- Now let's hang it, got it.
- Hey Jared, how's it hangin'?
It's not, it's not yet.
(light, peaceful music)
- Well things have finally
settled down around here,
and we have the painting finally hung
and I wanna show you, in all its glory,
it actually does look really,
really cool in the room.
How many people did it take to hang that?
It is big, it is very big, but
it's actually really light.
It's really secure, we have
some other stuff on the bottom
so nothing can separate it from the wall,
natural stuff I guess.
But I just think it looks
really, really nice,
the way the lights hit the
gold frame just make it shine,
it's just really cool and
Ellie is going to love it,
and I think it's just gonna
be a really nice piece to have
for our entire lives.
It's an original piece of
artwork, that's so cool to me.
- It is 5:30, and Jackson
fell asleep on me,
and drooled all over.
I fell asleep in Jackson's bed
because Calvin fell asleep
in my bed and was snoring.
Jackson came and found
me and fell asleep on me.
So cute, we're all gonna
stay up late tonight.
Jackson's over there.
- I've never been one to really take naps,
like on Sunday afternoons
I don't usually take naps,
and throughout our whole
marriage I've never napped
all that often, I think
I can count on one hand
how many times I've napped.
I think I just now realized
how much of a physical toll
this week has taken on our whole family.
After we hung the picture,
Calvin went to our bedroom
and fell asleep on the bed.
Ellie fell asleep downstairs,
Jackson cuddled up right next to her,
and fell asleep next to
her, and I was on the couch
thinking, wow, everyone's asleep.
And then suddenly the next
thing I knew, I woke up.
(chuckling)
It's just interesting, the
kids are being close to us,
and I like that, and it's been really nice
to be able to spend time with family,
to go through all this together.
And I think tonight we have something fun
that we can do as a family,
that will bring us close together,
and warm not only our
bodies, but our hearts.
(light, uplifting music)
- I'm doin' it myself,
up and down, up and down,
I'm going up and down.
Up and down, up and down,
up and down, up and down.
- Do you like it Calvin?
(laughing)
Today is the very first day
that we have used our fire pit.
It's a chilly day today, in
fact today's the chilliest day
of the year so far, after summer.
So we thought today
would be the perfect day
to end our weekend and to
have a little family time.
(light, uplifting music)
Give me your best Captain Underpants.
- Tra-la-la!
- Tra-la-la!
- Tra-la-la!
- Tra-la-la!
Can you do it Calvin?
Say tra-la-la.
(Calvin yelling)
(all giggling)
Come here boys,
gimme kisses.
- Goodnight.
Kisses goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, I love you.
- Today literally felt like
it was a day of healing,
with us being outside and the fire going,
it was cold outside, just
cuddling with the kids.
We're together all the time,
but especially the last
few days it's like,
we haven't been on the computers,
we haven't been doing emails,
we've just been laying with each other,
sitting with each other,
eating with each other,
it's just been very nice.
- The moments together
have been much more,
- With each other.
- Yes.
- Like quality time,
and that's been really nice,
and I've just been thinking,
life throws curve balls at us,
and we never know what we're gonna get.
But if we have a strong
foundation in family, friends,
faith, whatever it may
be, we can get through
anything.
- It helps a lot more.
- Yeah, and I feel so
grateful that we have that,
and I feel like the support we've had,
the knowledge we have,
everything has been so helpful
throughout this week.
Like Ellie said, it's just
been a nice day of healing.
- Just being together.
- Yeah.
- I feel, I didn't think
that today would be
as hard as it was, I
definitely need to go lay down.
- You did much more than you should have.
- Well, and I didn't feel
like I did,
- Shame on you.
well I don't feel like I did, you know?
I didn't.
- I know, I just,
when the days comes at ya.
- I tried not to be,
I tried to just...
- You were cute,
is what you were doin',
you were helpin' out
around the house.
- I did like one thing.
Okay bye.
- That's gonna be it from
us, have a wonderful week,
and start your weekend off awesome.
Thank you guys for watching,
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
