more than anything in the world
I wanted a son someone I could play ball
with someone who would run to me with
open arms when I got home from work
someone I could teach someone who could
teach me
someone who could carry my name someone
I could love and care for more than
myself someone who would look up to me
as much as I look up to my own dad
there was a time it seemed that my dream
wouldn't come true years went by and the
road became tough but we never lost hope
as if by magic through prayer hope and
help I could finally hold my sweet
little son
you
