Only time will tell.
- I'm sure--
I'm sure it will be very hydrating.

- Only time will tell!

- Yeah you hear that word positivity
and it's like so easy to hear and say,
but hard to do, it really is sometimes,
especially when you just don't feel it.
-  Who drinks Diet Coke?
-  Foo.
- I did.
- What?
- What?
- Grandma!
- Where?
- Hey, so I just have a
quick question for you,
are you guys happy that you live
next to each other or something,
because I feel this is your
homeostasis right here.
(laughing)
- I love it.
- I don't think this to pick so hard,
we've been working.
(laughing)
- Well that is so true,
that is so true.
- You think we're just sitting here
just laying and lounging.
- We are getting ready to go to a meeting.
- Yeah, they have a meeting
in just a little bit
and Ellie is getting the gas tank full,
or let me be more appropriate
for 2017, charging the
battery to your Tesla.
(joke ba-dum-ching)
Oh, everyone just went
oh Jared gross awww.
- Yes, Bonnie actually gave this to me
for dinner last night.
It's lasagna, but instead of meat,
it has tons of vegetables in it.
- You know what and Ellie, when she gave
it to me last night,
she was like, I'm kinda worried,
because there's no meat in it.
It was really delicious.
- I didn't say that.
- Did I?
- Yeah you said something--
- Yeah.
- I wanted to know if you liked it.
-  Oh it was delicious.
- I knew she would love it.
- Yeah.
- Did you honestly like it?
- Yeah I had it for dinner last night,
it was really great.
- Good.
- I don't remember saying that.
- Yeah, well I think you
said more along the lines of
I'm anxious to know what you think,
because there's no meat,
it's a veggie meal.
- It has mushrooms in it.
- And I'll tell you what I told my kids.
Eat it with the noodles
and you won't even know
there was a mushroom.
- Don't tell Julie.
(laughing)
-  Well oh my
goodness, Hi Sister Sue,
are you gonna help me work today?
Huh?
You popping here to say hello
and help me get some work done?
You love those ear scratches don't ya?
Is that the spot right there?
Oh that's the spot, oh
yes that's the spot.
She was chewing on my Bob Ross
socks a little bit earlier,
nibblin' my toes.
These are cool sockes, huh?
I showed them to you last
Sunday I think it was.
(panting)
Hey, I know you want attention right now,
I know it, that's all
you want is attention.
You just want me to
scratch you and never stop.
And my Bob Ross socks are too
cool for school right now.
Ah!
Of course, now you're sleeping on the job.
I see how it is.
As soon as I ask for help,
(snaps fingers) sleep.
-  That's not what I thought
nipple creme would feel like.
- It feels different than--
-  Feel it.
- Oh it's hard.
-  I know.
- It's a hard nipple creme.
- So I got some nipple creme
for when I have the baby.
It's supposed to be really good
and doesn't have lots of bad stuff in it.
It's Marcelle Nipple Creme.
- Marcel the Shell?
- Mar, I think that's the brand.
So I ordered a few maternity clothes.
This is one of them.
-  Ooh you look so nice.
- And I ordered this too,
because last time I just used coconut oil
and it was the most
painful thing in the world.
Same with Jackson, but
I used lanolin creme.
This is lanolin free.
But that's what I used with Jackson.
So I have this one for this baby,
but I got this shirt,
and then Jared and I are
going to a fun little--
-  Getaway.
- Getaway.
And so, I'm wearing this shirt when we go.
- That looks really nice.
- Cute, huh?
-  Yeah.
- So I got those from Tyme.
I asked you guys on
Twitter what some websites
to go to for maternity clothes
and one of them, you guys suggest Thyme.
T-H-Y-M-E.
So I got a few things.
- Like the spice?
- Yeah, so I got a few things.
And I'm excited.
-  Yeah.
- And I've just kinda been cleaning
on this cold winter day.
I got these emptied, cleaned my shoes.
- Well the thing about nipple creme Ellie
is I wish I could give some
advice to you about it,
but I've never had to
use nipple creme before.
- Duh, you don't have any advice to give.
- Right, I've never had to
use nipple creme before,
so I don't know if that's good or not.
Only Thyme will tell.
- I'm sure it will be very hydrating.
(gasps)
- Only Thyme will tell!
(Jared laughing)
- You think you're really funny, you are.
- That's funny.
Oh that was an unintentional pun.
- That was cute.
- That was good.
-  I totally forgot.
But why would I think
to forget your prize?
What did you get in there?
-  Choo choo.
-  The choo choo?
Hi Dad.
- Hi, we are just playing Peppa Pig.
-  Wow, Peppa Pig?
-  They have bunk beds.
-  So cute.
- And we are watching,
Calvin what's his name?
- Calvin, what did you just do?
- Pee pee!
- You pee peed?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you peed in the toilet!
Good job Mr. Cal--
now he's like, where's my chocolate milk.
-  Where's my Peppa Pig?
(laughing)
- I've tried to have
my week be pretty empty
and not have a lot of things
I've had to do this week,
so we could really focus on Calvin
and potty training.
And the next three days are completely
empty and good, and so we're gonna
continue working on him
with potty training.
I would say, because we kinda had started,
Sunday I wouldn't really count,
I would say Monday is a good official day
and I would say, how
do you think it's been?
Now Monday, now today.
- I feel it's gone like this.
-  Yeah.
- We're on the uphill part
of potty training.
- Yeah.
- Yesterday was pretty tough.
- I would say that too.
I kinda just want him to feel relaxed,
and I don't want to feel pushy
and if he goes in the potty great,
if he doesn't, we'll just tell him,
Calvin, where do we go potty?
And he'll tell me and he'll learn.
And I'm just excited that
we're getting this down.
- Oh yeah.
-  Especially in the
winter months, might as well.
- And having only one
kid in diapers is great,
so hopefully he's all the way good
when the new baby comes.
-  Totes.
I love this little thing.
- You should've hard
Calvin talking and playing,
he's like oh there, ba
ba ba, oh George, yeah.
-  Awww cute.
We got this when we were in South Carolina
for your family reunion.
- That's right.
-  We bought it to
have a toy at that house
and it's been so cute.
- It's the lake house.
-  The lake house?
Do you remember picking out sea shells?
- Uh-huh.
- Who did we give some to?
We picked up some seashells for who?
- Grandma.
- That's right.
-  Yeah, we're gonna
try that again sometime, huh?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
- There's your bunk bed bud.
-  Show me.
You got a prize?
Can I see it.
Whoa, the choo choo train.
I almost forgot to give him a prize.
Caught you in a yawn.
- Second you caught me in a yawn.
(laughing)
- He went potty and I was like good job
and we walked out, and he goes prize.
He definitely remembers
the times he needs a prize,
because sometimes I'm
like you didn't go potty,
you don't get a prize right now.
- You know what's funny is yesterday
at the end of the blog, I was like,
it's gonna be a pretty rough night.
And you just caught me
in the middle of a yawn,
and I was like oh I'm pretty tired still.
That was a pretty rough night.
-  Yeah how was our night?
It wasn't too bad.
- Diet coke!
- It wasn't as bad
- as I thought it was gonna be.
- Diet Coke, Diet Coke.
-  Did you say Diet Coke?
- Yeah, you've been hanging around Grandma
a little too much.
- Oh my gosh.
- Diet Coke!
- Thanks Grandma.
- Diet Coke!
-  Who drinks diet coke?
-  Foo.
- I did.
- What?
- What?
- Grandma!
- Where?
-  What?
- Okay, we are very very careful
about letting our kids drink soda.
And I guess grandma's have a special--
- Grandma's can, because
you're the grandma
and you can do what you want.
(laughing)
Calvin.
- What's your great idea Mom?
What's your great idea?
- Okay, close your eyes.

The boys are asleep and Ellie is
at a church activity,
where they are talking
about mental health, specifically
during the wintertime.
Yesterday I think it was,
Jackson and I were on a walk with Penny
and we were talking
about the winter blues,
and so I'm anxious for Ellie to get home
and talk to us about what
they're talking about,
they have a mental health expert there
who's going over all of this stuff,
so I'm anxious for her to get home
and to learn about everything
they talked about, so.
For now, I'm just cleaning up this mess
of a living room, because
we've had fun today
playing with all of these toys.
And the guitar, we busted out the guitar
after we played on the piano.
She wants those frillies.
- I know, well we--
You silly girl.
She's been sitting here
playing for 20 minutes
and she's been so soft.
We were bonding and then you got up.
-  I'm sorry I ruined your bonding.
- I just got back from
a fun church activity
and there was a health care
professional that came.
And we just talked a lot
about our mental health
and it was just really nice to hear.
It was a boost for me,
because this whole week I've felt very
not myself, especially mentally,
maybe it could be a little pregnancy,
maybe it could be a little winter blues,
I don't know what it is,
but I just haven't felt myself.
So it was really good going to this
and just hearing about life
and about just positivity
and it's like yeah, you
hear that word positivity
and it's like so easy to hear and say,
but hard to do, it really is sometimes,
especially when you just don't feel it.
When you feel down and blue.
He talked a lot about social media too
and the good effects that social media is
and the harmful effects
that social media has
and that kinda weighed heavy on me
and Jared and I talked a lot and--
- Well yeah, social media is our
livelihood right now.
- Life.
- And it can get to the point
where it becomes
addictions for some people.
And it can become
overwhelming for some people.
And we are on a fine line,
where because this is our livelihood,
we're usually on social media quite a bit.
And so we have to find that balance,
what works best for us
mentally, physically
and for our family emotionally
and all that sort of thing.
- Totally.
- And I encourage all of
us to find that balance,
not just you and me Ellie,
- Totally.
- but all of us, you included.
- I do like that Jared
and I check in a lot.
Like this week, you've noticed
that Jared's filmed a lot and I haven't
and most of that has been
because I've been trying
to work with Calvin on potty training
and he hasn't been dressed,
so it's me and Calvin are doing our thing.
Another big part of it is just mentally.
I just have been in a mental slump,
and so Jared's helped take over.
And some days, some weeks I do that,
and it's mostly me and the kids,
we kind of take turns doing stuff.
So I just appreciate Jared this week.
I'm really glad that I
went to this meeting.
I didn't want to, but then when I did,
I felt good about it.
Same with activity days the other day,
I was a little stressed,
not even stressed, just a little down
and then I just thought, what am I doing,
I can't have nine girls come over
and teach 'em how to cook
and be entertaining and play with them,
but then once they came,
it was really refreshing
and I had so much fun
and it was actually really uplifting
and it's service.
That was service.
I invited people into my home
and it felt really good to do so.
- Well I'm glad that made
you feel a little bit better
-  Yeah, totally.
- and I have something prepared
to make you feel even more better.
-  A song?
- Yeah.
