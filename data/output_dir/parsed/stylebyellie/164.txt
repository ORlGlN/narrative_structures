(dramatic operatic music)
-  Here you go, here's
your poop emoji costume.
- Hurry up, hurry up,
our cousins are coming,
our cousins are coming!
This is what they do when
their cousins are coming.
Your matching little bums, you're so cute.
This is a cute little sight I think.
This is perfect, because actually,
I need to get ready and as you can see,
I've been trying to get the kids ready.
Thank you so much Bonnie.
This morning she called me,
she said I have a pedicure,
would you like to come?
And I said yes, but Jared's working,
and we went to bed really late.
And she was so sweet,
and got us a babysitter.
So we are gonna go out for an hour
and get our toes done.
I tend to repeat myself a lot,
but I still get these questions a lot,
so I want to show you guys.
This is the hair gel
that I use for the kids,
it's Got2b Glued and it's glue.
Their hair stays
and I have tried so many other hair gels,
it's really dark in here.
I've tried so many other hair gels
and it doesn't work,
like this is the bed
hair gel for little boys
or little girls with short hair.
If it had little curls,
you could put it in your hand
and scrunch it, make it curly.
It's very very strong,
you only need a little
and it's really messy on your hands,
but once it's dried, it's glue
and it stays, so this is my favorite thing
for the boys.
But I always put them in
Jared's drawer right here
and they have their toothbrushes,
just 'cause like we're
getting ready in the mornings
and usually I have them get ready with me
and I sit them on the counter
and we brush their teeth
and do their hair,
so that is my little tidbit for the kids.
So here's the thing,
my great grandma, she
lived until she was 102,
and I remember going to
visit her with my mom.
I was really young, I was
probably like four or five,
and I remember her and her voice
was so week and so shaky, like this,
and that's exactly how it sounded like.
And there's been a few times in my life
where my mom has sounded like that
and if I have the slightest itch
in my throat and I clear it out,
it's like it damages my throat a little
and I sound hoarse.
And I didn't even get sick,
the kids are getting over their colds,
and like I didn't even get sick,
but I had an itchy throat
and I cleared it one day a lot
like I was constantly
like (clears throat),
and then the next day I had lost my voice.
So I sound worse than I am,
I mean I may look a little bad,
but I always think of my
grandma when I lose my voice,
because her voice was always so weak,
and I feel like that's
where I get it from.
And my mom, she has a weak voice too,
especially over the last few years.
We're like Mom, speak up,
she's like I am.
So I feel like my mom's voice
is a lot like her grandma's voice, so.
Getting ready for the day.
Doing a little dry shampoo, curl my hair.
What are you thinking Mr. Jackson?
Calvin, what are you doing?
Did you grab Jackson's robe too?
Yes you did, don't say no.
Right here, this is Jackson's.
Oh it's the one piece, it's yours.
Jackson has the same one downstairs.
Are you wanting to hold the camera?
- Yeah.
-  You want to hold it?
Do you want to say hi to our friends?
Are you gonna point it at Mom?
Okay, you hold it still.
Okay, so this was, her
name was Alice Jeanette,
was my great grandma that lived to be 102.
So there's a picture of her,
but this is a better one.
First, that was my mom's mom.
Is she not elegant?
-  Yeah that's mommy's mommy.
- Yeah, that's Mommy's mom.
Isn't that, she is so elegant.
But this was her mom, right there,
right there, Alice Jeanette.
- Mommy.
- Isn't that a cute name?
-  Yeah.
- That is so cute.
Are you happier,
now that you got to film?
- Yeah.
(babbling)
- Calvin, oh good morning buddy.
- Mine.
- Oh is that yours?
- Yeah.
- Okay boys, I have a question for you.
Jackson what do you want
to be for Halloween?
- Uh I want to be a buzz with no wings.
- Buzz with no wings,
that's very specific.
Calvin, do you know what you
want to be for Halloween?
Do you want to be Woody for Halloween?
- Yeah.
- Okay, awesome, very cool.
What do you think Dad
should be for Halloween?
- A pirate.
- A pirate?
That would be fun.
What about Mommy?
- Black widow.
- Black widow like last year?
- Yeah.
- That would be so much fun.
Mommy and I are gonna see
what we can figure out
to wear for Halloween.
Woo, spooky.
Boston, hi bud, how are you?
- Hi.
- High fives.
What do you want to be for Halloween?
- Hulk.
-  Hulk.
Show me a Hulk smash right now.
Boom!
Alright kiddos, let's go.
I feel like I'm herding cats here,
it's been like 10 minutes,
trying to get these kids upstairs.
Let's go guys, come one, we're gonna go.
Tonight we have a Halloween party
- Mwaaaa.
- and having a great Halloween costume
is one thing, but having a
great couples Halloween costume
- It's hard.
- That's another thing.
So we're going to the
Halloween Store right now.
And we're gonna find the
best Halloween costume ever
for couples.
- Cause it's no kids,
- couples only.
We're doing this.
- Mmm-mmm.
- We're doing it now.
- I did the poop emoji.
(Jared laughs)
-  We're doing this, aren't we?
(laughing)
- I've never been into a
Halloween store like this.
-  What?
Okay, here you go, here's
your poop emoji costume.
I feel like there should be a blow up one,
one that's even better.
Oh here's your costume Ellie.
There you go.
(laughing)
-  What
are we gonna do Rick?
We're so screwed.
He's gonna get to the ship
and smash the microverse
and then he's gonna kill
- What is it?
- It's Morty.
It's from Rick and Morty.
- Oh the one I don't like.
-  You're never seen it.
- Yes I don't like it.
-  You can't form
an opinion on something
that you've never seen, Ellie.
So if you want to be like extra clean
on this Halloween, you've
got yourself a loofah,
okay, and if you're a little hungry,
you've got your PB & J,
you've got your bacon and egg,
you've got your giant pickle.
- Eww.
-  Do you want
a pickle for a nickel.
Or, just your regular
old ketchup and mustard.
Those are some great couples costumes.
Yum, are those some good green beans?
Are those good?
Yeah, yum yum yum yum yum.
Ooh here, let's put some ketchup on them.
(cheek squirts)
Now take a bite.
Ooh, is that good?
Is that good?
- No, it's not real.
- Oh, where is your imagination young man?
Your imagination makes
everything possible.
- It's not real.
- Well we need to watch Hook.
Because they have a magnificent piece,
- That's not real!
- That you would not believe
with their imagination.
Now guess what Jackson.
Mommy and Daddy, we went and we got
some super super cool costumes.
Did you know that?
- Yeah.
I want to see them.
- I'll show you in just a minute, okay?
It might be a surprise
for you though alright?
And it might be a surprise for you,
because we got more than one costume,
because we've got some fun activities
the rest of this month,
and we don't want to spoil all of them,
all at once,
so here in a little bit,
we're gonna show you what we're wearing
to this party, okay?
- I just want to see them right now.
- Okay, so what do you think we should do
if you want to see 'em.
- Thumbs up if you want to see them.
- Okay, thumbs up if you want to see them.

- Um so I'm not quite sure how this mask
is working out, but I'm Batman.
I'm Batman.
- A little lumpy head.
- I'm Batman.
- He's lumpy head Batman.
- You look like a dinosaur.

- Sure, I'll take this.
-  This is $50 dollars.
- I just need this real quick.
-  Look at my hair.
- There we go.

- Sorry, we just need to sharpen you
a little bit, that's all.
(laughing)
- Give me that.
- So we made it to the party
and I'm super excited to see
all of the couples costumes.
So we're superheros, Ellie,
if you couldn't tell.
I'm Batman, I know it's hard to tell.

- Ellie's Wonder Woman
and we've got Crayons,

- A crayon box.
- Crayola.
- Yeah, so I'm excited to
see everyone else's costumes.
So we've got Dusty and Jayce over here,

So I'm guessing, wait, Jon Snow,

- Yep.
-  Awesome.
- That's a good guess.
-  And what was yours?
- I'm Ravenna from The Huntsman.
-  Ooh looks awesome guys.
Looks so good.
- You gotta get my sword.
- Oh yeah yeah yeah.
- Oh man.
- The sword's the best part.

Brady for having us over.
It was so much fun.
Never have I ever,
was that the funnest part?

spinning my body really fast.

You were mummified so fast.

I thought you were gonna win for sure.

we had the right idea,
and the toilet paper was one-play,
so anything you did it ripped.
- Yeah, it was really cheap.
- It was really cheap toilet paper.

I think we had the best
costumes of the night.
Wouldn't you agree?

Snow was pretty good.
