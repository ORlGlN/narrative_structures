(gentle guitar music)
(Jackson yelling)
-  Penny, what good is a pillow
if you don't even lay on it?
- Well after laying in bed all morning
and Jackson's like please, I want to eat,
I'm like fine, I'll get up,
I'll make breakfast.
I made some eggs
and Jackson wanted to eat outside.
I said it's a little cold, I think.
He goes that's okay.
And so he is eating outside.
Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah.
-  And you can
see my pan the other day,
I totally smoked the house out,
so I threw it out here to cool off.
Why are you cute to want
to eat out there Spiderman?
Okay do you want me to close the door
or do you want to come in?
You want to come in now?
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
- Bye.
-  Hi, you're on
the phone with someone?
Who are you talking to?
Oh the graham cracker.
What did the graham cracker have to say?
- Says it's talk.
-  Are you talking?
It's ringing, answer it.
He's gotta update his app first.
- Hey!
-  Hey that's his
phone, where's your phone?
He's gotta update his apps
first, before he can use it okay?
- Hey!
-  The new operating
system just came out.
He's gotta update, so he
has the latest firmware.
- Where's the letter E?
E!
- Like what kid uses a graham cracker
as a cell phone.
That is the time that
we're living in right now,
where phones are this thin
and they look like candy bars
and graham crackers.
What's the deal guys?
We get home from church
and the first thing you can do is just
take off your clothes
and you're in your diaper and undies?
What's the deal, huh?
Huh, what's the deal?
What's he?
He gave this knife and
just patted me on the leg
and was like, here you go Dad.
Hey are you comfy now?
Are you comfy now?
- Yeah.
-  Close your eyes, go to sleep.
(laughing)
(Jackson yelling)
- That's his reaction from
when Mom and Dad just kissed.
Where is he?
- Hey Jackson, I want to kiss her.
- Jared just kissed me and Jackson went
(yelling)
(yelling)
Wait wait Jackson wait
stop stop stop stop,
wait wait, hold on one second.
(yelling)
(laughing)
- You're a goofball.
(yelling)
- Hey Jackson.
(yelling)
Follow me this way here real quick.
Let's take a closer look.
Oh, some more evidence here.
Ah-ha.
Excuse me, Calvin,
-  Go tell Dad what you did.
- Come over here young man.
Calvin Scott Mecham,
I need you to come over with me please.
Calvin come on!
Excuse me young man,
do you know anything
about this right here?
Is that yours?
- It's mine.
-  Well where's the rest of it?
- Gone.
-  It's gone?
- Yeah.
-  Where did it go?
- Show.
-  Where'd it go, you're
gonna show me where it went?
- Yeah.
-  Okay let's see, show me the way.
(laughing)
- No.
- No not here okay.
-  Did he look in the toilet?
-  Well he went
in there and said no.
Where did it go, show me.
No, not down the stairs.
- No.
- This is the great chocolate detective.
Show me where it went.
- No.
-  No?
Where did it go?
(laughing)
- No.
(laughing)
No.
-  No?
Okay, is it in your tummy?
- Yeah.
- Yes, it's in your tummy.
It's in your tummy?
- Yes.
-  You took me
on this wild goose chase
and it's in your tummy this whole time?
(laughing)
- Dad, he took one and
it was in his tummy.
- Yeah, oh my goodness.
Okay well here's the deal,
you are your mother's
son, that's for sure,
that's point number one.
Yeah, I'm looking at you.
- He's silly.
- Point number two,
you can't just leave garbage
lying around the house.
Let's go throw it in the garbage, okay?
No?
- You know what, that made my
dad always always the maddest,
he'd be like I don't care that you ate
the last licorice,
I don't care that you ate it,
don't leave the empty bag in the pantry,
because then that makes me mad
when I go to eat the licorice
and there's none there.
- There's nothing there.
- That's the worse thing.
But guess what,
I'm guilty of that more than anyone else.
in the world.
- Oh yeah.
- Calvin, that was hilarious.
- You guys have seen on our vlogs
and on Ellie's Instagram Stories
that we love Hello Fresh.
It is dinner time, so we
are making Hello Fresh.
But what you guys probably don't see
is all of the times outside of the vlog
that we're actually using
and making Hello Fresh,
because we love it.
It's easy, its quick and it's delicious.
Hello Fresh is a meal kit delivery service
that delivers food to your door for free
in a recyclable, insulated box
and all of the food is pre-measured, cut,
whatever you need to
make it fast and easy.
Today we are making
Carolina Barbecue Chicken
and I've just gotta smash
this chicken down to size.
(pounding)
(sizzling)
(chill twangy music)
While we're watching this sizzle,
it smells so good already,
every week, Hello Fresh comes out
with new recipes and they come
with step by step instructions.
And each meal takes
like 30 minutes to cook.
This one says it takes about 20 minutes.
Each meal comes out to less than 10 bucks,
so it's a great deal for great food.
- So while Jared is
finishing making up dinner,
I wanted to tell you guys
that we only have three meals shipped
to us a week.
You can definitely have more,
but we have felt that for our family
that that's perfect,
because if there's a day
we want to go out to
dinner, we can do that,
and that also gives me the opportunity
to still cook some meals that I want,
but I'm not so overwhelmed
with cooking every night.
The meals that we've made
that I've absolutely loved,
I've written down, and then I go out
and by those on my own and make those,
in addition to the meals that we get
for the new week.
So I have Beef Ragu Spaghetti
that I have written down
that I really liked.
And the Southwest Stuffed
Peppers are awesome.
You can see Calvin drew all over it.
But those peppers are my favorite
and I instagramed those the other day,
or I tweeted that the other day.
It was by far my favorite
and then I made it for my
sisters the other night.
And then today for lunch,
I actually made the Chicken
Pineapple Quesadilla.
So good, like all the meals are hearty,
they're yummy.
I cook a lot more in the kitchen,
but it's just been a nice break for me,
so I don't have to prepare dinner
and lunch every single day all the time.
It really has eliminated a lot of work
on my shoulders, so I'm glad.
We've been doing this for how many months?
- Nine months?
- Yeah, so the first time we did work
with Hello Fresh, we really liked it,
and then we worked with them another time
and then Jared started just having it come
every week, just because we really
just fell in love with it, so.
This would be awesome for
the holidays coming up,
sometimes you really
don't know what you get
your parents that have
pretty much everything
that they want or need
and this is something
that I'm writing down,
shhh, I don't want my parents to watch.
Something that I want to get family,
because it's helpful.
-  So this is what
the final plate looks like.
I'm so happy with myself.
I think it looks so delicious.

Seriously Hello Fresh, thank
you for being today's sponsor.
Thank you for making my wife
happy and love you so much.
Because she really really does.
- Hey I want you guys to
come fold my laundry next,
that would be great.
- Full service Hello Fresh.
Goodnight.
Goodnight buddy.
Hi sweet girl, did you
have a good potty break.
Yeah?
You're such a good girl.
Penny, what good is a pillow
if you don't even lay on it?
There you go, yeah, get
in your place, come on.
It's the funniest thing,
lay on the pillow Sillypants McGee.
That is not comfortable.
That is much more comfortable.
In church, you know I teach primary,
so I teach the eight
and nine year old kids
and in the big class where
all the classes get together,
we sing primary songs,
and one of the songs we were singing about
is families, it's about families
and families can be together forever.
The first words are like I
have a family here on earth,
they are so good to me,
and while we were singing that song,
I just got punched in
the gut, in the heart
and I just thought of
something for a second
and I just
(gentle music)
We have been trying to have
-  Yeah.
- a baby and it has been difficult for us.
We've gone through two
miscarriages recently
and I just have been thinking
about our future family.
And I got hit with the realization
that we may only have two kids of our own
and that's not a bad thing.
This may be our family right now
and I'm so grateful for them.
I'm not sure what the
future has in store for us,
but I just got hit with the fact that
this might be it and that's
not a bad thing at all,
but it was hard for me to hear that voice
say that to me, because of what we've gone
through and everything
and I'm not trying to set
any standards or plans
or anything like that,
but it just came into my head,
-  You need to always
be grateful for what you have.
- Yeah exactly, I want to
be grateful for what I have,
but I also want to be prepared
for the events that may or
may not happen in the future.
Whether or not that is true,
if we do or don't have more kids,
it just hit me that that's a possibility
that Jackson and Calvin may be it.
And I feel like I have to preface that,
I am grateful for our kids,
but it's just hard to have
that come to my realization.
Do you know what I mean by that?
That's what I wanted to
tell you a little bit.
It's not too often that I just get hit
with these moments, these
sudden clarity things,
and I never wanted to come across
that I'm not grateful for what I have,
because the amount of gratitude
that I have is unimaginable.
And it was just weird for
me to have that feeling
and to have it so close to me right now
and I feel like that's
the feeling that I wanted
to have come across,
and I don't know what's going to happen,
but I want to be prepared
for any situation
that may come.
You may have heard that this
video is filmed on Sunday
but it's uploaded later.
We're currently a day
ahead of schedule right now
and that's on purpose.
After Halloween, Ellie and I
are going to be out of town
and we're not going to be able to upload
while we are out of town,
so we have some videos that we're filming
in the meantime to go up while we're gone
and we'll resume normal schedule
as soon as we get back.
I wanted to let you
guys know ahead of time,
so you're not shocked when it does happen,
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.
I'm excited for you to see the videos
that we have planned,
but for now, we're gonna end the vlog.
Thank you so much for watching.
I hope you had a wonderful evening
and we will see you next time.
Bye.
Go get Mama.
Go get Mom, go get Mom.
-  Penny (growls).
- Go get Mom, go get Mom.
- Penny.
- Hey that's my towel.
-  She wants to wash her face too.
