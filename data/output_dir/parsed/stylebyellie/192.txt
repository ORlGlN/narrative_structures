♫ I'm a pinchy crab
(screams)
-  That's the legit crab.
(upbeat music)
Good morning, Penny.
-  Good morning, Penny.
-  Good morning, Jackson.
- Good morning.
-  We have a special day today.
What are we doing?
- Preschool!
I'm wearing this backpack,
and this underwear,
and this pants, and this
shoes, and this shirt.
-  Wow.
- I'm gonna bring these rocks, too.
- K.
Okay, you guys know that
Jackson loves rocks,
and I'm not gonna tell him no,
especially on the first day of preschool.
- I always put rocks in my rock box.
- Yes, you do.
Why don't you put them right there?
Perfect.
Jackson and I are the only ones up,
and it's actually we gotta go to school
in like 20 minutes, huh?
Everyone kinda had a
rough night last night,
so I think that's why
everyone's still sleeping.
- Yeah.
- Are you excited to
see your new teachers?
- Yeah!
- Yes.
K, let's get your pants on.
What are you excited about for school?
- To play on the slide.
- On the slides?
- Yeah.
-  'Cause they have slides outside?
- Yeah.
- You'll be a really good
listener to your teacher.
- Okay.
- Right?
- Yeah.
- And we don't take toys out
of other people's hands, right?
- No.
- Okay.
- Right.
- All right, little
mister, my Mr. Preschooler,
this is your hair.
All right, guys, I've
been doing my boys' hair
for years, obviously--
- I'm a monkey. Ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
- And I've talked about
this a lot of times.
Can we show our friends your hair?
This is the hair gel that I use,
and their hair stays
looking nice all the time,
even when they're rough playing.
This is the Got 2b glue.
Excuse me.
K, I think you're ready.
- Let's go to preschool.
♫ I'm a pinchy crab
♫ I'm a pinchy crab
-  No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
♫ I'm a pinchy crab
(screams)
that's the legit crab.
That looks scary.
Today is Jackson's day.
He's getting ready for preschool.
He's excited.
I want him to just have
what he wants today,
and he is going to be cracking eggs,
'cause we are making eggs for breakfast.
Hit it really hard once, really hard.
Perfect.
This is your favorite thing to do, huh?
One of them.
Ooh, k.
-  I got egg on me.
- That's one.
We'll pick some of the shells
out, and we'll try it again.
By the third one, I bet you'll be a pro.
Look at his face.
Pick up another one, and
we'll crack it again.
Here, I'll show you one.
Then, you do one.
Do something like this.
Do. (screams)
(laughs)
Don't do that.
Who knows how to crack an egg better?
Mom or the toddler?
K, I meant.
I don't know what I'm
doing holding a camera.
You try it.
(laughs)
Here, here try it on here a little bit.
- I'm gonna spill it on the counter.
-  Try, try not to do
what I did just a little bit.
Hurry and hit it, and then bring it over.
Perfect.
Now, over here and peel it up.
Mama's gonna help, too.
One, two, three, like that.
Perfect.
-  I need a towel.
-  Good job!
That's a good crack.
Good job.
Woohoo, that was pretty good.
Just a few shells.
-  I didn't spill.
-  Yeah, you did so good.
- Strawberry milk!
Hot, hot, hot.
-  We are sitting
here eating breakfast,
and Jackson is looking
across at the stove,
and he said, "Look, I made that butterfly,
"and I made that picture for preschool".
You totally did, and I can't wait to see
what you make this year.
I love those two things.
- We've had them hanging
up ever since we got 'em.
I'm so mad that--
-  Our stupid refrigerator
doesn't hold magnets, guys.
- The front of our fridge isn't
magnetic, but the side is.
-  But not the flipping front,
which I probably wouldn't
put a ton on there anyway,
but, I mean, two things would be so cute.
-  I wanna hold
it, I wanna hold it.
- You wanna hold this magnet?
-  But, instead,
I'll put 'em on my oven.
- I'm gonna pray.
Now, let's pray.
Do it.
-  Oh, you want me to do it?
- Yeah.
-  I thought you wanted to pray.
- I just want you to pray.
-  Okay, dear heavenly Father,
(gentle music)
and we say these things in
the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
- Amen.
-  Amen.
(gentle music)
♫ I'm a pinchy crab
♫ I'm gonna pinch you there
(laughs)
(gentle music)
- Hey, past Jared, this is future Jared.
Just wanted to come in and say hi.
Get ready for this workout,
'cause your legs are gonna be burning.
Trust me. I'm future Jared, and I know.
My legs are burning.
(energetic music)
- Are you ready to get
Jackson from school?
- Yeah!
- K, let's go!
Let's go!
Are you ready?
We have been seriously
doing a ton of phone calls,
getting some stuff done while
Jackson's been at school.
Have you missed Jackson?
You missed him playing with you,
and singing the bum song?
- Yeah.
- Bum bum bum, bum bum bum.
(gentle music)
Jackson!
-  You're back!
-  Are you excited?
- Yeah.
-  Did you enjoy school today?
- Yeah, it was fun.
-  It was fun.
You had snack time, and then
you had extra class today
of music time.
-  Did you have
a music class, today?
- I did a lot of things.
-  What did you do in music class?
- I did Criss Cross
Applesauce, and I drummed
with sticks, and I did another song.
-  Wow, can you
sing one of the songs?
♫ One, two, three, four, five
-  That's one of my favorite songs.
- Well, when we picked Jackson up,
the music teacher came out.
She's done this for 30 years,
and she teaches a lot of kids,
but sometimes she'll go to
preschools and do classes,
and she grabbed me and
said, "He is so good".
She said, "I really want
him to be a part of this,"
and she gave me a flyer
of this other music group.
She said, "I would love
him to be a part of it,"
and I said, "That is so cool".
I was so flattered, and
I said, "It's funny,
"because Jackson," I mean,
we are a music family,
like Jared loves guitar and singing,
and it's funny 'cause Calvin
is so like loves to dance.
Calvin is totally like--
- He feels the music.
He feels it.
- Yeah, he's a total music boy, too,
and I know that Jackson is
too, but I've always felt like
Calvin has really enjoyed it,
so it was really fun to hear
the teacher say that
Jackson was participating
and was really good.
I have a few flyers.
I've gotta look at our schedules
and figure some stuff out,
'cause I think that would
be so fun for them to be
part of something else, as well.
- Jackson, give us an
overall view of the day.
Did you like preschool?
Do you wanna go back again?
Is it a thumbs up?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, thumbs up for preschool.
(laughs)
-  He's so tired.
- I played hopscotch.
I got some gems, and--
-  You got a gem?
Is that for being a good boy?
- I didn't get a prize yet.
-  Yeah, you gotta
have enough gems, huh?
Did you see some friends there?
- Yeah, my best friend was there.
His name was, my, he
was a different friend.
-  And you liked him?
Good, I'm so glad.
Did you share?
- Yeah.
-  I'm so happy!
Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm super hungry.
- All right, guys, the
kids are taking a nap
and doing quiet time, and
I had to make a quick trip
out of the house.
We're having a little issue
with insurance right now,
trying to figure out how
our new insurance works.
I've had to go to all of the
doctors that the kids and I
have been to the last few
months and get some statements
so I can send more
information to my insurance,
so I was like, "Oh, I
gottta get outta the house,
"gotta run these errands real quick".
I told Jared I was gonna run that errand
and that I would be back really quick,
and I had to stop and get Swig.
I hardly drink soda, but Swig is so good,
so I grabbed a soda, and I may or may not
totally have gone to Hobby Lobby,
because I just wanna look at a little bit
of their decor stuff.
I feel a little guilty,
because Jared is doing so good.
He is drinking water
with all of his meals.
He's been working out.
It's been a few days with his goal,
and he is feeling really
motivated and good,
and I know that he'll watch this
and just smile and be
like, "You're cute, Ellie,"
but I do feel a little guilty.
I did text him, and I said,
"I'm gonna make one more stop".
I'm gonna enjoy my soda,
and I'm gonna hurry
and go look at some Halloween stuff.
All right, at the ocean,
you know that Grandma Great
asked Jackson to get her some seashells,
and, when we packed our bags to come home,
we packed seashells.
Look at these.
These are some of the big
ones that Jackson and I found.
Crazy.
Jackson, what jar do you want?
- I just want.
-  You want this one.
K, this is for mom.
I'm gonna put it in the bathroom,
and we got this one for Grandma Great.
Look at all of those seashells
that she has in there.
You gonna dump that?
Awesome.
Look how beautiful these are.
Seriously, it was so fun doing that.
- Look how big this one is.
-  I know.
-  That's so cool.
- I found this one.
-  You did.
You found almost all of them,
and this is the new home
for all of the seashells
that we collected.
We got a little figurine
of the lighthouses.
So sweet, and this one's yours.
Are you gonna put that next to your bed?
- I'm gonna put them next to, on my clock.
-  Next to your clock?
That's a perfect idea, and--
- Mine goes right here.
- Perfect.
I love that.
We need to straighten some things up,
but that is an awesome spot to put it.
Jackson, I had so fun looking
for seashells with you.
That was so relaxing.
I love the water.
The ocean is beautiful.
-  What are you
doing in there, hon?
- I'm getting my snacks.
-  For what?
- To watch my shows.
- Oh, the Bachelor in
Paradise is back in action.
You've got a double feature.
It was on yesterday.
You didn't watch it, and it's on today,
so Ellie's back in business.
I think I'm gonna join you,
but certainly not in those--
- Not like usual.
- Not with those snacks.
I think what I'll do is I'll
just chew on this lemon,
'cause that's healthy, right?
Oh snap, can we just talk
about how Wells dropped
that truth bomb for a second?
You see Wells drop that truth bomb?
- Yes.
- That was some deep stuff. Sorry.
-  I don't have
a heart to move Jackson.
-  He's so cute right here.
- He fell asleep.
-  Aw, hi, bud.
- He doesn't do this much.
He doesn't just fall asleep
in our bed like that.
He'll come up, but he won't.
So cute.
- Hey, he had his first
day of school today.
How sweet is he?
- Love you.
He's so tired.
- Yes, he is.
He zonked right out.
I have filmed this clip like seven times
just trying to find
the right words to say.
There's so much going on in the world,
especially in our country.
I mean, we have Hurricane
Harvey, Hurricane Irma,
some states are on fire right now,
and I just feel so bad for so many people
who are going through this right now.
Our thoughts and prayers and best wishes
are for you guys right now.
We have extended family
whose house burnt down today,
whose house was flooded
in Hurricane Harvey.
This is a difficult time
for a lot of people,
and there's not a ton that we can do,
but we want you to know that our hearts
and our prayers are
with you guys right now.
Ellie and I have done some
donations as much as we can,
and we want to do more,
and we appreciate so many
of you guys who have
given us links and ideas
as far as things that we can do,
and we've been doing those
things, so thank you for that.
We so appreciate it.
I was reading an article
today on the internet
about backing up your electronic files
from your computer onto
an external hard drive
or a USB drive or anything
that you can back stuff up,
because that is something
that a lot of people
don't think of is that kind of thing.
Everything is so physical, but,
if you guys are going to be
evacuating or anything
like that, I encourage you
to make sure your computer's backed up.
It's a lot easier to take
a hard drive than it is
an entire computer, and those
pictures, those memories,
a lot of those are digital now,
and that's one of the things
that we don't want to
lose is those memories,
and we wanna hold onto those forever.
Again, our thoughts and our
prayers are with you guys.
We hope you guys are doing
the best that you can,
and, with that, we're gonna end the vlog.
Thank you guys for watching.
Hope you guys are doing well,
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
