(gentle piano music)
- Hi Mom.
- Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
this is called redemption.
Here you are my wife, a whole box.
- A whole box.
-  Just for you.
- Because you should never get a donut
behind your pregnant wife's back
and then not tell her, and
let her sister tell her.
- There were some words that should
not have been said last night.
- Yes they should have.
(Jared laughs)
- I love you.
- I love you.
- It's spicy.
-  It's spicy?
-  I want to do it, I want one.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Oh my goodness.
- Spicy.
-  It's spicy?
- Me.
-  You want it?
Here, you eat the rest
of your strawberries.
I'll save the lemon for my water.
- Lemons are so spicy.
-  'Cause lemons
are sour, lemons and limes.
So sour, but watermelon
and strawberries, mmm mmm.
Those are yummy, huh?
- Yeah.
(bright music)
- Wee, let's go.
-  Are you ready Mama?
- I am ready.
-  Let's go.
- Okay I have our grocery list.
The next few days are going to be so fun.
-  Mmm-hmm.

- We asked Jackson,
should we watch Clifford
or should we listen to Greatest Showman?
Actually it was his choice,
The Greatest Showman was on
and he asked to watch Clifford
so I went to put it in
and he said, no I want to
watch Greatest Showman!
So, we're listening to
the music, huh Mr. Jacks?
- I could definitely get used to this.
What do you guys think?
Pretty cool?
That's the front,
that's the back,
here's the bed.
Pretty incredible, right?
It's not ours.
Did I scare you for a second?
I'm actually at the RV store,
because I'm grabbing a
part for our car to tow
our trailer that we have,
the one that we love.
Because we're going on a family adventure
very very soon and we're
taking the trailer,
we're packing it up
and we're having a little fun.
(lively music)
- I don't know who I yell at more,
Calvin or Penny.
(laughs)
Calvin!
Let's go give it back to Jackson!
Okay,
(Calvin squealss)
got your arm, let's go back to Jackson,
give it back.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Okay go give it back.
Perfect.
Jackson, did you know
that I've been cleaning
your ears since you've been
just a little tiny baby?
- Yeah.
-  And did you
know that I used to sing
♪ Clean clean clean ♪
♪ clean clean clean ♪
- Yeah.
-  And that used
to make you not cry.
- Yeah.
-  You would just be so good.
I used to go
♪ Clean clean clean ♪
♪ clean clean clean ♪
And that was it
and then you'd be done.
- Yay now I'm done.
- And did you know I
used to brush your teeth
that way too?
It's like, when do you stop doing that?
I used to do that with
Jackson all the time, I'd go
♪ Clean clean clean ♪
♪ Clean clean clean ♪
and that would give me long enough
to be able to clean his ears
and then I would do the same
when I brushed his teeth.
I don't remember the last time I did that.
But I remember I used
to do it all the time.
K, bedtime!
Go put that one away.
Perfect.
So many clothes, I gotta get packing.
Getting ready for our
little family getaway,
I'm very excited for.
There's a few things
that I really want to do
before baby comes
and we happen to be doing two
of those things this week.
But one of them for sure is a get away
with everybody and Penny.
And so Jared's getting the camper ready,
I'm getting packed up, ready to go,
I have a grocery list that I've made
of things that we're gonna eat.
And we're just gonna go
have fun for a few days
in our camper.
We're gonna enjoy the sun.
We're gonna go on some hikes, so,
I'm just super excited
to get out of the snow
and just go play and let
Penny run at some parks.
Right now I am packing for two boys,
but pretty soon, I'm going
to be packing for three boys.
And it's just really crazy
that I say that.
It still is unreal to me
and I'm gonna give you guys
just a little baby update.
(boys laughing)
Can you hear them laughing?
This is what they do every single night
and it makes me so happy and grateful.
My boys laugh every single night
and then here in ten minutes,
they will go to sleep.
Ah, my heart.
I am 24 weeks pregnant
and the baby is the size of a cantaloupe.
The baby is already starting
to get his wake time and nap time
routine starting right now.
I think for the first time
in my pregnancy, I had a good dream.
It wasn't a scary dream,
it wasn't me and Jared fighting,
it wasn't intense,
it was peaceful and sweet and it was,
I deserved that, and I'm so glad.
I had a dream of me holding him
and I saw his little face
and I just was holding him
and it was as real as could be.
And then I woke up super fast.
It was like a glimpse of him
and then I was awake.
And I thought about it
for two days straight
and I wish so bad I could have
another dream of him,
but it was so real.
So it's just making me even more excited
to hold him.
But I can see why,
so I've never owned a DockATot,
which I got for the baby.
I can see why people really love it,
because I have been snuggling
and have been cocooned
in my pregnancy pillow.
I love it.
And then in the mornings,
when I wake up, Calvin will push me over,
make me scoot over to one side
so he can cuddle one side of the pillow.
So I'm excited for the baby to try that
and for me to see if babies like that too.
Obviously they like to be cocooned,
but it'll just be really fun.
But I'm loving my pregnancy pillow.
I've been feeling this
week has been a good week,
especially emotionally.
I've been feeling really good.
I am 24 weeks, it's flying by.
I have been drinking a ton of water,
strawberries, lemon, strawberry and lime,
I fill this bad boy up several times a day
and I drink it.
But this week, you can
tend to get more leg cramps
and back cramps, so in my app,
I have the Bump app.
In the app it tells you each week
what you should be feeling
or what's going on,
it's called The Bump.
So I'll click on it,
and I'll go down, it'll
talk about the baby
at 24 weeks.
And it says that this week stay hydrated,
because you can start to get a lot
of leg cramps and your
belly's growing even more.
And this week my belly has popped.
Like I've had a belly,
but it is there and I am pregnant.
I've had a few Braxton contractions
that have been so unbelievably tight
and I'm just like (breaths),
I have to sit down
and breath it out, it is crazy.
And then I've been getting some leg cramps
and I've been getting
tons of Charley horse's
in my toes, like tons.
So, I've been trying to drink
more water because of that.
And then Jared had got me a Bump box,
so every month I'll get
a little box of goodies.
And about two months ago,
I had got this body wash
and I just got done with it.
And it smelled so good and it was awesome,
so I'm actually gonna try and look this up
and get some more of this
or I really want to try the Dr. Bronner's,
his body wash, I want to try that too.
I haven't always been a body wash person,
like I just use soap and that's it,
but I've actually really been liking
how gentle this has been.
I really want to try the
Dr. Bronner's body wash.
I was actually going to order it
and then this had came in the mail,
so I didn't order it.
But that's what I want to try next.
And the last thing with baby is,
I am finishing up his nursery,
I've already showed you
guys the design plans in it.
But I saw this and it
instantly made me tear up
and I totally got it
and I can't wait to put it
on his shelf in his room.
And then to take it off his shelf
and let him play with it.
I found this cute little website,
it's called Little Saplings Toys.
But it's just handmade
little wooden rainbow
and I just thought that
was perfect for him
and I cannot wait to get it
and have that in his room
with a picture of an
ultrasound next to it.
I think that'll look really cute,
so I got that for baby.
Overall, I have been feeling really good.
I have been trying really
hard to rest a lot,
because I know that I am not going
to be able to once he's here, as much.
I love my quiet time with the kids
while we watch shows.
Today, I was on the couch
and Calvin's hand was right here,
and then he goes, huge baby, baby
and then he just sat there for a minute
and rubbed my tummy.
And then Jackson was cuddling me
and rubbing my tummy.
And when I sit on the couch,
it's not like I'm like,
come here, cuddle me boys.
I sit down and they gravitate towards me.
I swear I don't just put them on me,
just for a picture or just a video.
They just gravitate and snuggle me.
Everyday Jackson's like,
will you cuddle me and watch a show,
and I'm always like, yes I will.
I just love how cuddly they are
and just them being right by me today
and then noticing my
belly and rubbing my belly
and laying on my belly,
it just reminds me of
the picture that I took
of Jackson laying on my belly
the day before Calvin was born.
And I remember that moment,
or it was that day that I went in.
I think it was that day
that I went in, that night.
I remember taking that picture
and just having such a special feeling.
And maybe that feeling was knowing
that was the last picture with Jackson.
It was just so sweet
and my hormones are all over the place.
(laughs)
I'm such a brat to people.
Jared's probably so sick of me.
And I cry a lot, I already cry a lot,
but just even talking
about that moment's sweet,
because I told Jackson.
I've been trying really hard
to give Jackson a ton of one on one time,
because it makes me kinda sad
knowing that another baby is coming,
because when I had Calvin, I remember,
why am I crying?
We're gonna cut this.
Before I delivered Calvin,
I remember rocking Jackson,
we're gonna cut this,
I don't know why I'm crying.
But I remember before having Calvin,
I was rocking Jackson
and I remember whispering in his ear,
you're always going to be my baby
and it's just kina weird
to think that I'm gonna have another baby,
it's just crazy to me.
So I'm really trying to take my time
throughout the day
and give each kid one on one time,
because most of the time, it's both boys.
And they love it, and I love it,
but I really am trying
to give Calvin his one on one time,
Jackson his one on one time
and then later, both of them, you know?
So that's it.
I did not expect to cry.
You guys made me cry.
Talking out loud is crazy.
You guys should vlog,
because when you talk
your emotions out loud,
you'll be surprised at how you feel.
But that's my pregnancy update.
I'm a boob, I'm 24 weeks.
I'm looking forward to
maternity photo shoots.
If you guys know of any maternity dresses
that are white, let me know.
I can't really find any that I love
and that I feel would be pretty,
because a lot of them are just tube tops,
which I don't really love.
I think it's more
flattering with something.
Anyway, let me know.
Thank you guys for watching.
We are gonna have a heck of a weekend
with the boys.
We are going to party with them,
so stay tuned for that.
And we'll see you guys next time.
Don't forget to check
out my new Bollie website
in the description
and we'll see you next time guys, bye.
