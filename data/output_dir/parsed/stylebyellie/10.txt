-  Are you hiding?
- Mmm.
-  Okay, get down, hurry get down
before he sees you.
He's counting.
He's coming.
Hide, hide hide hide hide hide hide hide.
(gentle guitar music)
Is this your hiding spot?
- Yeah.
-  Okay. (laughs)
- I'm hiding here.
(banging)
- Where's Calvin?
-  I don't know, follow the noise.
(banging)
Oh my gosh Calvin, no no no oh jeez.
Oh my gosh, I was wondering
what that sound was,
oh crap.
Don't leave tools in your office.
Okay, out of my office, let's go.
Oh my goodness, there's--
awww, I hope the keyboard still works.
Okay, let's out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Out out out out out out.
So much for playing hide and seek.
Good morning guys and welcome to the vlog.
Oh my gosh,
I don't think it's appropriate for me
to be talking to you looking like this.
Hold that thought.
I'm looking for my hat,
because I don't want to do my hair today.
It's not in my office.
My broken keyboard is though.
It might be in here.
That is a hat, that is correct,
but it's not my hat that I want to wear.
It is my hat,
but it's not the one I want to wear.
Okay, again, this is a hat,
but it's not the hat that I want to wear.
Hey Jackson, do you know where my hat is?
- No.
-  You don't?
- No.
-  Oh.
- I think it's in my room.
-  Is it in your room?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's go look.
In here?
I don't see it in here.
-  I think it's in my closet.
-  Okay, let's go check that.
In your closet?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
Oh my gosh, how did it get there?
- I don't know.
- Ah, I feel so much better now.
Now I feel like I can talk
to these guys appropriately
without being embarrassed.
- Yeah.
- I came outside to be with Penny
and because I needed a
little bit of fresh air.
There she is, she's gonna come
and jump on my shoulders.
(Penny panting)
(laughing)
Hi Penny girl.
What a sweet girl.
I wanted some fresh air
because my head's been hurting.
(laughs)
And it's probably because of this.
Ah Penny, no!
Oh she got my hat.
Hey, I had to work hard to get that hat.
Come back here.
Penny Penny!
I lost that hat.
Oh jeez, arrrrr.
You like the smell of Daddy's head?
Is that what it is?
As I was saying,
I wanted to get some fresh air
because my head has been hurting
and I've just had a lot on my mind
and I wanted to talk with you a little bit
about what I've been thinking about.
Last night my Dad said
our whole family an email
about the story of my grandma
and her last year or the
last half year of her life.
She had severe dementia, Alzheimer's,
and for the last six months to a year
she couldn't talk, she couldn't speak,
move very well, let alone remember anyone.
But my dad and her had
a couple special moments
before she passed, where
music opened her mind
and allowed her to remember
my dad for a minute.
And it was just such a tender story
and tender moment that my family
will remember forever.
It's just special moments like that
that stay with you for your life
and that story got me
thinking about vlogging
and why Ellie and I do what we do.
It made me think all the
way back to our very first
doctor appointment, to
the very first video
where I built a beauty stand for Ellie,
to the time we got pregnant.
Ellie!
- Oh my gosh!
- We're pregnant.
- I'm gonna be a mom.
-  All of these
amazing moments in our life.
(gentle guitar music)
And I couldn't help but
think about the why,
and how important the why is in our life,
what we do with our life
and why Ellie and I are
doing this right now.
I want to focus on that why.
(tender music)
The moments in our life, the celebrations,
the happiness, the down times,
all of those shape and create who we are
and the future
and being able to look
back on those things
is very special to us.
And reliving these moments
through these edits is something
that I will cherish forever.
And whether they're
simple or extravagant--
Are you ready to go on an adventure.
- You are so weird.
-  The whole
limo just to ourselves.
- Hey.
- Difficult or exciting,
we're creating these videos
for us to look back on,
to remember and to feel.
And maybe even teach.
Maybe even relate.
I've always told Ellie that
I want people to feel what we are feeling
when it comes to things,
when we're going through
life and these experiences.
And I hope that shows,
but that's something that
I've always tried to do.
And I hope that in the future
we can feel more,
to relate more and to experience more.
You may remember years ago,
we started this vlog
because we were documenting
our infertility journey.
And also because I never met my grandpa.
I've never heard his voice
and I've only heard stories about him
and I never wanted my
kids to experience that.
So we film our life so our kids,
our grandkids, our great grandkids,
maybe even that far,
could relive these experiences
that we go through.
That maybe we could teach them,
maybe we could show them things.
Maybe that we could make them laugh,
maybe they could cry with us.
And I hope that's what you
get out of this, as well.
Is that we go through life,
when it's difficult, we
can lean upon each other.
When it's happy, we can
laugh with each other.
But I want to focus on the why.
And I know sometimes we
do things differently.
Life isn't always the way we want to go,
but I hope that we can
experience life together
and go through these
ups and downs together
and just feel a little bit more.
Feel closer to each other,
understanding for each other,
and I hope you know what's in our hearts.
And I think that's one of
the most important things.
I hope when we document this
that you feel what's truly in our hearts,
because that's what we want to get across,
love, kindness, happiness,
charity, sometimes some
really bad dad jokes.
(laughs)
and all of that.
I know that this was a long rant.
I just hope that you feel
what I'm trying to say
and that the jumbled
words that I just said
make at least a little
bit of sense to you.
I hope we can focus on the why
we're doing what we're doing.
And I hope you can find
the why in your life.
Because if we start with why,
then everything else
goes out and makes sense.
(gentle guitar music)
Do you miss the snow already?
I'm so grateful we don't have any
and you're the one who's rolling around
in what we have left.
(Ellie laughs)
Ah!
-  Penny no.
- Can I help?
- You gotta spray it on the right way.
Hard woo, perfect.
-  Jackson, will you
show Calvin where to spray?
- You spray right like that.
- Good job.
- Perfect.
-  Okay Calvin your turn.
- Press it really hard on the--
- Perfect.
- Good job.
-  Whooooah.
Can you do that Calvin?
(Jared laughs)
I loved going downstairs like that
when I was your age.
Alright Calvin, let's do a roll call.
You've got your doggie blanket, check.
You've got your big dog, check.
You've got your medium dog, check.
You've got your little dog, check.
- No, cat dog.
-  Cat dog?
- Yeah.
-  Do you even
know what cat dog is?
- Yeah.
- That's a major throwback.
That was a show when I was a kid.
♪ Alone in the world
with a little CatDog. ♪
What book are we reading tonight Jackson?
- This!
- I know, One Fish, Two Fish,
Red Fish and Blue Fish.
-  Yes, let's read this book.
- No, red fish.
-  Red fish.
Oh almost forgot, one last dog.
There you go.
Black fish, blue fish,
old fish, new fish.
This one has a little star,
this one has a little car.
- No this blue star.
- That is a star.
- No, blue star.
- It's a blue star, that's right.
Hi boys.
- Hi.
- Look at this.
- That's your check.
- It's my cheek.
- Yeah, that's your cheek.
Do you boys know that your mom and I
are so lucky to have you in our life?
- When we were a baby?
- And even now too.
Did you know that there was a time
that we were married
and we didn't have you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was just me and Mommy
and we wanted you boys so bad
and we're so lucky to
have you in our life.
Do you want to know something?
- Yeah.
- You make us smile.
- Yeah.
- You make us laugh.
And we love you so much.
- How did you didn't have me?
- Well before you were born,
it was just me and Mommy.
- How?
(music ends)
- That's just the way it was.
(gentle guitar music)
(laughs)
We'll get into that when you're older.
And before me and Mommy fell in love
and got married, it was just me.
- Yeah.
- And I was with my family,
my brothers and sisters
just like you have Calvin.
- When you got married, was it only you?
- When I got married, it was me and Mommy.
- What happened when it was only you?
- I lived with my family,
with Grandma and Grandpa Mecham.
And Uncle Ryan, and
Uncle Nate and Aunt Mel
and Uncle Matt and Aunt Jennifer.
Do you miss your cousins?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Can you say hi to all you cousins?
- Hi stinky cousins.
(laughing)
- Hey, we had a good day today, didn't we?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
- We played hide and seek.
We took Penny on a walk
and we played with our bikes and scooters.
It was a good day today.
- And the Hoverboard.
- And the Hoverboard.
It was a great day
and I can't wait until tomorrow
when we do another great
day just like that.
Can you say goodbye to our friends?
- Bye friends.
- Goodbye friends.
- Bye friends, goodnight guys.
- Goodnight guys.
- Night guys.
- Before we end the vlog today,
I wanted to give you guys a reminder.

we're actually doing a giveaway.
So we'll have a link down below
to the Bollie Instagram.
Friday is the last day,
that's when we're picking
people for the giveaway.

Thank you guys so much for watching.
The Start With Why,
that is a book that I've
read that's by Simon Sinek,
it's related to business,
but it's also very related
to personal things too.
Why you start something.
And it means a lot to me.
So that's kinda the message
that I wanted to bring is, start with why.
And that's what we're going to try and do,
so thank you guys for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up.
It was kind of a different one today,
but thank you guys,
we'll see you next time.
Bye.
