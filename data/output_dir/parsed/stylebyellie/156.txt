- Hey guys, happy fall season.
It is that time of year where
the pumpkins are orange,
the leaves are changing.
Hopefully they're not
already brown in your world.
- And the pumpkin spice
is flying off the racks
like no one's business.
- Everything that should and shouldn't
be pumpkin spice is pumpkin spice.
And so that is what the
video is all about today.
We have some very interesting
pumpkin spice flavored things
that we are going to taste test.
Not only us two, but with the boys.
- Yes, the boys wanted to join.
A huge thank you to Brian and Missy
for wanting us to do this video as well.
They just did theirs and
I believe our friends
Colin and Katie are going
to be doing theirs soon.
- If you want to see their
videos, we'll have theirs
in the description down
below and in the eye cards.
- Let's start with pumpkin eggnog.
Our kids love chocolate
milk, so I think this will be
a good segue into starting
this to see their reactions.
(child screaming)
Kids, are you ready?
- Come on boys!
- So you're gonna taste a bunch
of things that are pumpkin spice.
- Okay.
- Daddy, Calvin.
- And me.
- And you.
- So the first thing that we're tasting
today is pumpkin spice eggnog.
So what I want you to do boys,
- Calvin loves it.
- I want you to take a drink,
and then tell me what you think about it.
Is it good, is it bad, is it funny?
Tell us what you're tasting.
- Negative, I have a
hard time drinking eggnog
as it is.
- Well you like it.
- The pumpkin eggnog is ucky.
- You like it with 7 Up.
- To dilute it.
I can't handle eggnog.
- I like straight up eggnog.
- Do you like it Calvin?
- Calvin just downed it.
(laughing)
He's like, "I want another please."
- Do you like it?
Oh, good.
- I would like it.
Yeah, I think I would like it.
It's not too much pumpkin spice.
It's just the right amount.
- Okay, you guys keep your drinks
because you may want it for this next one.
That's Daddy's, Calvin's, and
let's do the caramel first.
This next one is a candy caramel
called pumpkin pie caramel.
So we each have our caramels.
- This one right here, Calvin.
- I'm anxious to see what you think Jared.
I love caramel, so I
know I'm gonna love it.
- Calvin just said, "No,"
and ate the chocolate.
- Okay well, tell me what you think Cal?
He doesn't like it.
You like it?
- I like it.
I like chocolate.
- I don't like it.
It's really, it is not good.
- Is it spicy?
- It's not--
- I like the caramel.
- I'm getting the spice
now but it's just like,
does not taste like pumpkin.
- 'Cause it's caramel jalapeno.
- Oh, you jerk!
I was like, what the heck?
This does not taste like pumpkin at all.
- That's why you have the red bowl.
I didn't want the kids getting mixed up.
(laughing)
Is it hot?
- Like the more it's
in my mouth, it's hot,
but I was like wait a minute,
this is not pumpkin at all.
- This is the pumpkin one.
Don't let the kids eat that one.
- Jalapeno, who makes a caramel jalapeno?
- Yeah, it's called caramel jalapeno.
- Jalapeno business.
- That's more chocolate.
- Ugh, Mom what do you think about that?
- I loved it, I loved the caramel.
- The first one.
- Did you like the caramel?
- Mommy.
- Calvin still wants more chocolate.
- I'm indifferent about it.
I feel like I've got too much jalapeno
in my mouth to make an informed decision.
This tastes like caramel to me.
- All right, this next taste
test is really nice chocolate,
so I cut them in half because
these are really nice.
So this is the limited edition
pumpkin spice chocolates.
Lindor, is that how you say it?
Now my favorite ones of
these are the salted caramel.
That's what's amazing.
There's yours.
- I don't like salted caramel.
- Calvin already ate his, so he liked it.
I got jalapeno in my mouth still.
- I think it is so good.
- Did you let it melt in your
mouth or did you just bite it.
- I had just all of it.
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).
- Do you like it?
- It's not even strong.
This is probably my favorite so far.
It's so subtle.
- It's good.
- You almost can't even tell.
- Holy crap, Calvin!
You want more?
- Yeah.
- Okay here, let's try another
pumpkin spice thing first, okay?
This kid just downed it like crazy.
I think that's his favorite.
- My cup.
- So I saw this at the store
and I thought this was probably
the most interesting one.
Oh, Calvin's like, "I'm gonna take yours."
- Oh, my.
- This is boom-chik-a-pow
pumpkin spice kettle corn.
I love kettle corn.
- Love kettle corn.
- That's like my favorite popcorn ever.
- I don't like it, I don't like it.
- Well we're gonna have to
give it a taste test, won't we?
So let's open this up and try it.
You just don't imagine
pumpkin spice with popcorn.
- Caramel popcorn with cinnamon bears.
My mom just started making that
quite a bit and that sounds really good.
- Smell it, tell me what you think first.
- It doesn't smell good.
- No.
- I want one.
- Here we go.
- Mm.
- Oh, you do like it now?
I have to say, no I'm not.
- Yeah, I don't like that.
- There's like white caramel
spread throughout it.
- Yeah, it's like a thick,
oh it's a weird texture.
- I think after five bites of that
I would feel really gross.
- Yeah, yeah.
- It doesn't feel refreshing.
(laughing)
Can popcorn be refreshing?
(Calvin babbling)
- Kettle corn, kettle corn
is very refreshing I think.
- Okay Jackson, tell me what this is?
- Pumpkin cookie.
- This is a pumpkin
cookie, and I have no doubt
that we are all going to love it.
Now wait, we have a lot of stuff to eat
so I'm gonna break a little bit off.
If you want more after we
eat all the pumpkin stuff,
then we can have more.
- I want to have this one.
- But I don't want you
guys to be too sick.
- Pumpkin cookies are
such a classic thing.
I feel like since we grew up
on this, we're kind of biased.
- Yeah.
- But it is so good.
- Really good.
- Yeah, you can't beat a
pumpkin but I'm gonna be honest,
the store bought--
- Not as good as homemade?
- This is not as good.
I wouldn't eat three of these in a row.
- I would definitely eat one.
- I don't really like the store bought.
I'm gonna say no.
- I like it.
I think it's good.
I would definitely eat this.
I am eating it.
- It has a weird aftertaste.
- Do you boys like it?
- You like it?
You like it Cal, okay?
- Muffins!
- Muffins!
- That's right.
- These are called pumpkin
chocolate chip muffins,
or Israeli Palestinian conflict muffins.
- Israeli Palestinian conflict muffins.
- That's a YouTube throwback--
- That was forever ago.
- If I've ever seen one.
I imagine these are gonna taste
very similar to the cookies
'cause they have chocolate chips in them,
and that's gonna be a big flavor
to take away from the pumpkin.
- This is breaking.
- Uh-oh.
You better eat it so quick.
- I'm gonna be very
honest, I really thought
that these would be the two things
that are like a no-brainer
that are really good
and I do not like them.
I don't know, I think it's 'cause
it's maybe store and not homemade.
- Maybe, homemade has a
very special taste to it.
- Yeah, I don't really love this.
- It's good, not great, right?
- Totes.
- You boys are just chowing
them down though, huh?
Do you like them?
- We have some pumpkin
spice Hershey kisses.
Now what are your favorite Hershey kisses?
- I like the candy cane
ones and the mint ones.
- And I have to say I like
the caramel ones the best.
- Oh, caramel is really good.
- Is this caramel?
- This is pumpkin.
- I will like it.
- I do not like it.
- It's mushy.
- Mushy, mushy.
- It's too much.
- It's too mushy.
- It's too spicy.
- You're just not a
pumpkin spice fan, huh?
- I thought I was.
I really don't like it.
- I feel like a lot of
these that we've tried,
they just don't leave you asking for more
which is maybe a good thing.
- I do not like it.
- You don't?
- Now these little pumpkin things,
these are just like candy corn
so I don't think they
have any different flavor,
but they're delicious.
- I wanna try one of these.
- Good.
You cannot go wrong with candy corn.
Sorry, the sun's right in my eyeball.
Do you see it, is it bad?
- It's just you light up my world.
- Yeah, you can't beat candy corn.
- I do like it.
- You don't?
- I do.
- Oh, good.
- Good.
- Do you like it, Cal?
(laughs)
- Good, we've still got a lot more.
- I'll save these to pass
out for trick or treating.
- Ellie!
- Heck yeah.
- Are we doing full size
candy bars this year?
Are we gonna be that family
who does full size candy bars?
- Nope, we're doing Hershey kisses.
- Oh, I guess that's the answer.
What's next, Momma Roo?
- Okay, I think we should
break out another drink
'cause I really need to
drain all this stuff down.
- So here we have Stephen's gourmet
pumpkin spice hot chocolate.
Stephen's hot chocolate has some
really, really great flavors.
- Oh, I don't like this flavor.
- You've never even tried it, silly.
They have lots of great flavors,
so I'm hoping good things from this
because I feel like they
have a good name behind them.
Does everyone have their hot chocolate?
- Yes!
- Tell me if you like it.
- Okay, give it a sip.
- I like it.
- I do like it.
- Um, I'm not a big fan.
I just love--
- I do like it.
- Like chocolate mint so much.
- I do like it.
- I'm more of a fan of the eggnog.
I would do the eggnog more.
In the bowls in front of us,
we have three different types of cereal.
We have Special K pumpkin
spice crunch in this one.
we have Honey Nut Cheerios
pumpkin spice in this one,
and we have Frosted Mini Wheats
pumpkin spice in this one.
We're all gonna take a
taste test of each one.
- Let's start with
Special K pumpkin spice.
- Okay, you take a bite Jackson.
- Okay, I'm gonna try it.
- It hardly tastes like pumpkin spice.
You like it?
It's good.
I wouldn't buy it, I
mean it tastes just like.
It's good, it's not rich though.
- No.
- I'm gonna try this one.
- I'm anxious about the Cheerios though
'cause I feel like that
might have more of a kick.
- You like this one?
- I like this one.
- I like that one.
- Okay, Calvin and I are
trying the shredded wheat.
- Cheerios win for me.
- Frosted Mini Wheats, it's good.
Not too weak, not too powerful.
- Cheerios win.
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).
- 'Cause it's not too strong.
- Yeah, cheerios is good.
- Not too powerful.
- Not too powerful.
Okay Calvin, he's grabbing the next one.
We are just about finished with
all of the foods that we have.
The second to last one we have
is pumpkin spice Nestle chips.
They're just like little
morsels that you have
that you put in cookies.
So we're gonna try
them, see what we think.
One for Mommy, one for Jackson,
one for Calvin, and one for Daddy.
- Oh, I don't like it.
I don't like it, I don't like it.
- It would probably be
better in a cookie, cooked.
- I was just gonna say, are
these meant for cooking?
- Yeah.
- Did I make a mistake?
- That's gross.
(coughs)
That's gross.
- I don't like it.
(babbling)
- All right, we have the best for last.
Who does not love a good Oreo?
- Everyone in America loves Oreos.
- Everyone in America loves Oreos.
Oreo has come out with a
lot of interesting flavors
the last few years.
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).
- Some have not been the best.
- Yeah, but some of them really do.
I think Oreo thins are the best.
- Yes, Oreo thins are the best.
- Here you go.
Okay, ready?
- I'm gonna try it.
- It tastes the exact same.
- Did they just trick everyone in America?
- Is this a trick?
Oreo, did you just trick us?
- It tastes like a flippin' Oreo.
- Halloween Oreo, right?
You'd think it would
be a different flavor.
- Yep, it's the same.
They just color it orange.
- Oh my gosh, orange
color cream, same taste.
I'm an idiot!
- No, they are.
- Or they're smart.
- Bad advertising.
That was clickbait.
Oreo, you just clickbaited me, mother!
- I like it.
- You do?
- At least it still tastes good, right?
- Wouldn't it have been
funny if I was like,
"Oh, this is gross."
(Calvin babbling)
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that was funny.
Best for last, Oreos you can't beat.
- So we tried all of these
pumpkin spice things.
What was your favorite and
what was your least favorite?
- The Lindor chocolates were my favorite.
My least favorite was the Hershey kisses.
Boo!
- The Hershey kisses or the Nestle things?
- No, the Hershey kisses.
- Okay, my favorite was the eggnog
and my least favorite was
the Nestle chocolate chip.
- What was your favorite?
- My favorite was the Oreos.
- Well, duh!
- And what was your least favorite?
- I liked the hard chocolate.
- Oh, he liked two, awesome.
- Cool, so that is our pumpkin
spice taste test challenge.
What other pumpkin spice
flavors have you guys seen?
The weirdest ones, I want to know.
Let us know in the comments
section down below.
- Jared and I feel fortunate
that we could sit down
and do this fun video for you,
that we could go out and buy a bunch
of fun pumpkin spice flavored
items and test them out.
Right now is especially
the season of giving,
and we wanted to donate to a food bank.
- So Ellie and I are gonna
contact our local food bank
and we're gonna make sure
that we give a donation back to them.
- Thank you guys so much
for watching our vlog today
and we'll see you tomorrow.
- (in unison) Bye!
(imitating explosions)
- Pumpkin to the face!
(glass shattering)
