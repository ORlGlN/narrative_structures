(jangly upbeat music)
-  We have made
a video every single day
for 1,210 days straight.
But we've never done this before.
Good morning guys.
We have to be so quiet.
Ellie is still asleep.
Bless her heart, thank goodness she gets
to sleep in a little bit.
But I thought it would be nice
to have her wake up
to me making her a nice, warm bath
to start off the day.
(running water)
Good morning.
(Jared laughs)
Hi sleepyhead.
Will you do the honors?
- Yes.
We got two fidget spinners,
because duh, we wanted one.
And usually I'd sit in the tub and do it,
but this is a special one,
we're gonna watch it.
-  Oh.
(game show fail music)
-  I don't think
this is a bath bomb.
-  Do you put it under the tub?
-  Yes, this is a
-  Bubble bar?
-  Uh-huh.
-  I'm sorry, I just ruined it.
-  That was a Lush fail.
I never had a Lush fail.
There we go.
(running water)
-  You got to hold
it like a fidget spinner.
- That's kind of a fail, but that's okay.
(sighs)
- Today's a big day, Ellie.
Are you ready?
- Yes, are you?
- I think I'm ready.
(sweet guitar music)
- Oooh, hi.
(kisses)
Hi.
(laughing)
How are you?
(kisses)
- Boo!
(yelling)
-  Hi bud.
Hi.
- Come here.
- How are you?
- Did you bring me a present?
- I did, I brought you something little.
Did you poo poo in the toilet?
- No, Calvin did.
- Calvin did, that's so cool.
Did you poop in the toilet?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  Oh my goodness.
- He pooped a little nibble.
(laughing)
- You didn't take a
nibble though, did you?
- That's fun.
We got you that one.
What is it Calvin?
What is it?
- What is it, a fidget spinner?
- That is a bath bomb fidget spinner.
- What?
- Is that cool?
-  What do you see?
- A bomby.
- Do you have any toys?
-  A bomby?
- I don't have any toys.
(laughing)
But we brought you a bath
bomb fidget spinner, okay?
-  Is that so cool?
- Yes.
-  What do you say to Mommy?
- Thanks Mom, what are these?
- You're welcome.
And we just got you some winter clothes.
You wanna see 'em?
- Yay!
- We made it back just in time for dinner.
We are making the yummy
Hello Fresh tonight.
You guys know how much I
absolutely love Hello Fresh,
but we are actually going
to do a little flashback
video for you.
Thank you so much Hello Fresh
for sponsoring our video today.
- We just got home from our drive,
from the plane ride
and from California,
it was awesome, but our bellies are empty.
And luckily, I just opened the fridge,
we have one last Hello Fresh left.
Thank goodness because Ellie is starving,
the kids are starving and I'm starving.
You guys know that we love Hello Fresh,
for those of you who don't know about it,
it's a meal kit delivery service,
where they deliver food to your house
every single week,
in pre-portioned packages, all set,
ready to go and that's a huge part
of why I like it,
because it makes it easy for me to cook.
I help a little bit around the house more,
and it's like 30 minutes
around there to make a meal.
So it's quick, healthy and it's delicious.
(groovy bright music)
All the ingredients right here.
Today we are making chicken
under a zucchini blanket.
It sounds delicious.
Each meal has a recipe card
that is super easy to follow
and each of the meals come
with a recyclable insulated box
delivered right to your doorstep
and each of the meals are
less than $10 dollars.
Alright, there is dinner.
I think it looks delicious.
I have really enjoyed having Hello Fresh
around the house for months now,
because it gives me something to do
that's easy, quick and it's delicious.
If you would like to join us
and I know a lot of you guys already have,
I'll have a link in the
description down below.
Use the promo code, ellieandjared30
for $30 dollars off of
your first week of meals.
Like I said, I'll have
a link and everything
in the description down below.
And we want to thank Hello Fresh
for being today's sponsor.
Now it's time to eat Ellie, I'm starving.
Woop, dinner is served times two.
We are gonna eat this dinner
and then there's some things
that we want to talk to the kids about.
Also we have something
that we want to tell you.
I think we're going to
talk to the kids first,
and then we want to sit down
and Ellie and I want to
have a chat with you.
(sweet guitar music)
- Ellie] Was that not the sweetest?
- Yeah.
-  She was just sitting by you.
Aww, that was sweet too.
Go sit down.
-  Come here Penny.
-  Awww.
-  Wait wait,
start.
Don't peek yet, don't peek, it's exciting.
But we want to talk to you first, okay?
Are you ready?
We've got a couple things that
we want to show you, okay?
One for Jackson
and one for Calvin.
- We're gonna go somewhere.
This is for Jackson.
- Ooh.
What is this?
- Buzz Lightyear.
- Buzz Lightyear, do you want to hold it?
- Yeah.
- Then Calvin,
- What is that?
- This is for you.
Do you like it?
- Uh-huh.
- Are these swimming suits?
- No, but you'll need your swimming suit.
We are gonna get on an airplane tomorrow
and we're gonna fly to Florida,
because we are going to
take you on a big big boat.
We're gonna go on a cruise
and we need to wear some costumes.
So we got you a Buzz Lightyear costume
and a Woody costume.
- Do you know how we went to Disneyland?
This is a Disney boat.
- We're gonna see Mickey Mouse and Pluto,
and Goofy and Minnie Mouse,
and all of our friends from Disney.
And you are gonna dress
up as Buzz Lightyear.
- Me.
- And Woody.
Yeah that's right, that's you.
- And this is me.
- That's right.
Oh Jackson there's one more thing.
You need your space ranger helmet.
- Does it fit?
Wow, do you like it?
- Uh-huh.
- Good.
- Are you boys so excited?
- Here we go.
- This is so fun.
We are so excited to take you
and we're gonna go with you, is that okay?
-  Look at these bodies.
-  Okay, come
stand next to Jackson.
-  You guys look so cute.
Woo hoo!
Woody and Buzz, here we come.
We are packed and ready to go.
-  Yay!
(vocalizing and clapping)
-  Okay.
- We have vlogged for
1,210 consecutive days
without missing a single day.
- That's with us getting pregnant,
having babies, having
post-partum, sleepless nights.
- Going to funerals,
family trips, camping,
where there's no internet.
We drove four hours to upload
and then drove four hours back
to be with family.
- Which we loved.
And I have loved doing the daily videos.
And we've never missed a day
because that's what we had chosen to do.
- Absolutely.
- We've never wanted to miss a day
and I think that now's the time
to just take, just a small break
and then we'll be right back on track.
- Yeah.
So we're gonna take a
break just like Ellie said.
When we go on this cruise,
we won't be uploading every single day.
And that feels, it feels
- I hate it.
- Yeah, it feels so weird
to me that I say that.
- I know it's not a big deal,
but to us, we really like
that we've been able to say
we've been doing dailies.
We have fun with it, and
we want to keep doing it.
Jared and I had this cruise scheduled
and booked a few months ago.
Our plan was to pre-film some videos,
like challenges, Q & A's, fun videos,
have them go up while we were gone
and then come home and do
one video of the cruise.
As it got closer and us going
through our miscarriage,
this is like good timing and bad timing.
We've kind of canceled some trips,
we've canceled some things
that we had on our schedule,
because I just needed to take a breather
and cancel things, and this was actually
on that cancellation list.
And I told Jared let's
just see how we feel
after a few days.
And I think that this will be good for us.
- Yeah.
- I would never have booked a cruise to go
only like a week after miscarrying.
- I think if we would
have known this was gonna
happen, we wouldn't have scheduled it.
- No, but this is where
we are at right now.
We have decided to go.
It'll be really fun for the boys.
From what we've heard,
you can get some relaxing time in.
We'll see.
I'm looking forward to it.
- I absolutely am.
I mean when we think think about it,
vlogging for 1,210 consecutive days,
you know, there is some times
where you just have a little burn out.
And I feel like this is
gonna be a great time for us
- To recoup.
- To recoup physically,
mentally, emotionally
- Spiritually.
- And all of that.
And even just between Ellie and I,
I feel like this is gonna be a great time
to have together.
- I feel like Jared and I
really have grown closer
than anything else that we've had
in our almost eight years of marriage.
I feel like I've re-fallen
in love with Jared.
I really have, like there's
been many tears shed
on his shoulder this week
and he's been there to pick me up.
And I haven't done much to pick him up,
he's a lot heavier than me.
I've enjoyed my time with you this week.
- Well thank you and I love you.
Woo.
- Love it.
- I've been working
out, so it's really easy
to carry you, put you on my shoulders.
This is pretty unique for us
to do, as you guys can tell.
- Even days where there has
been a day where we're like
oh we don't really fell like filming,
it's always been really nice, too,
because I have loved capturing our kids.
- Yeah.
- And I've loved capturing
just what we've been doing.
This has been so fun
for Jared and I to do.
- With that being said,
we will take a break.
We will see you guys soon.
Don't worry about everything.
And I hope you guys understand.
I know there's gonna be some people
who don't quite understand,
but we need some time
physically and mentally
and this is weird timing,
the way it's all working out,
but I feel like it's also good timing,
the way it's working out.
- Yeah.
We will be back roughly in a week.
We go out tomorrow,
I believe we get home
- Saturday?
- Saturday, so Saturday next week.
- Yeah.
- And then we'll have
maybe one or two days
of what we did on our little vacation
and then we'll be back.
So thank you guys,
this is really awkward for us,
really weird to take a break.
It's gonna feel really weird.
- I feel almost like superstitious,
but I know that it's necessary.
- Yeah, we're gonna turn our phones off.
We're gonna try to disconnect
just as much as we can.
- When we come back,
expect some great things.
Expect some different things.
Expect some fun things.
And expect awesomeness,
because that's what we're gonna bring.
- Okay, that's a lot of expectations
that you just put on me.
- Shoot, did we overpromise
and are we gonna under deliver,
I don't know.
- Don't ever overpromise.
(laughing)
Okay, thank you guys for watching.
Thanks for being understanding.
Thanks for all the loving
kind words and stories
you've shared, especially
with me this week.
I have read them and I appreciate it.
We'll see you guys next week.
- We've never said that before.
- Bye.
- Bye.
