I seriously felt like I am going to
choke my throat cell and going to spray
some deep spray in it and then me and
Kevin are gonna take a bath because he
won't stop crying
good morning guys today is starting off
a little bit different than normal le
was up all last night with Calvin and
because she's not feeling too great she
has she has a really really hard time
breathing right now I think she may have
strep throat we've been around some
people with strep throat so we are going
to go take her too insecure right now so
I just took Ellie to the insta care and
I left to go grab a couple things for
the kids and for Ellie but basically
what's going on she's just had a really
hard time breathing last night and this
morning she's been around a few people
with strep throat so that's kind of what
we're thinking is her throat was just
ridiculously sore she can't say anything
she's having a hard time breathing so
hopefully they can just give us some
antibiotics and we can go home but it's
about an hour wait in the insta care so
they've got some movies which is nice
for Jackson and Calvin but we'll
definitely be hanging out here
so checks that blow and all over my
pants I have zero wipes and I don't have
any diapers Nelly has them all and she's
in the back room I don't know if you can
tell but like all right here we're all
down here my pants are soaked I am so
glad you're back alive I had to use tie
paper but I'll take baths yes that's a
great idea
hey can ba ba ba ba
everyone in the house is asleep except
me I just busted out the vlog got it
uploaded everything is good
Calvin is asleep Jackson asleep and
Ellie's taking a quick little nap while
they're napping I thought I'd be a
really good husband come into the
kitchen and take care of all of these
dishes crap Ellie what the heck
shared he beat me to it she must have
done while I was editing gosh dang it
Ellie we're supposed to do those I was
supposed to do it I'm supposed to be the
good husband not supposed to be the wife
while you're sick cleaning up the
kitchen oh my goodness I don't even know
like how strep throat works I've never
ever had it before but Ellie's like I
can't even breathe can't even talk it's
terrible so well I'm going to tidy up
here a little bit hopefully everything
will be all good
when Ellie wakes up
I feel so terrible guys but she's been
such an amazing trooper she has been so
helpful around the house which she has
every right to not be I don't get it
she's just like still doing all this
stuff but she's she's being her awesome
self hey how you doing
hanging in there you're cute you know
