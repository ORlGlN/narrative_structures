- Are you gonna fly the
Star Fighter for us Calvin?
- Yeah!
- You're our best pilot.
We need you to accomplish this mission
without any casualties.
Can you do it?
- Yeah.
- Alright, let's do it.
Okay we're going into hyperspace.
Whoa!

Good morning and welcome
to the Grand Cayman Island.
Today is going to be filled with swimming,
snorkeling and sunshine.
Well, sunshine in our hearts,
in our hearts.
(lively music)
- Today is more of a quiet day.
We just got back from swimming
and Jared is venturing out into the sea.
The kids are getting a bath
and of course, I did
bring some bath bombs.
We are going to have some quiet time,
so we're all gonna have a little nap,
and then I think I'm gonna take 'em
to the gift shop today and
pick out something special.
We have brought the ocean into the boat.
Look at this blue purple water.
It looks just like the ocean.
Is that your bath bomb?
- Yeah.
(lively music)
- I have just landed on
the Grand Cayman Island
and I'm doing a port adventure today.
I am snorkeling
and I've never done
proper snorkeling before,
so I hope it's really really great.
I hope we get to see some
really great sea life today.
(lively music)
They don't have Dr. Pepper on the boat.
- We just got done with play time
and of course, we had to grab a snack,
which his a little carrot cake.
We just walked around the shop here
and just said okay, I want that,
and they give it to you, and you walk off
and eat it, it's awesome.
The food service here is so cool.
Ewww.
And we are now standing in line
and who are we gonna meet?
- Sofia.
- Sofia.
We're gonna meet a few fun characters,
while we eat our snack.
(atmospheric music)
(underwater bubbling)
(atmospheric music)
- Stitch downstairs.
- You saw Stitch downstairs?
- Yes I did.
- Oh my goodness, did you
give Stitch a big hug?
- And I saw,
I saw Sofia too.
- That's amazing, give me a big hug.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Okay, you tell me, how was it,
on a scale of one to 10.
- It was a 10 for sure.
(Ellie yells)
Get this, you want to know something?
- Yeah.
- I think I saw a shark.
-  No way.
- Yeah.
- I was kinda scared, yeah.
- Were you scared?
-  How big?
- Probably like that.
- Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
- I'm pretty sure I
caught it on the GoPro.
-  Dad, was the shark this big?
- Yeah, it was probably about as long
as you and I are long tall.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Dad, why did you see a shark.
Why did you see a shark?
- Because I was snorkeling.
- Jared, I cannot wait to see the footage.
The boys and I had a wonderful time.
We went to the play time, we got a snack,
we met some fun people.
I think it's been really fun
to talk with other people on the ship
and know where everyone's from,
and this is a lot of
peoples' 10th, 11th cruise,
they come every year,
they've made it their family tradition
or their family trip to go every year.
It's just been fun.
I'm starving.
I'm a starvin' Marvin.
- Okay, can you hold that thought,
because I have something for the boys.
-  What?
- Jackson and Calvin, I
got something for you.
Okay while I was snorkeling,
I got something for you boys.
Are you ready to see?
One for you, Calvin,
and one for Jackson.
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
Calvin, this one's for you.
It's a little turtle.
That one's for you.
-  Say thanks.
- It's a turtle.
- And then this one Jackson is for you.
- Turtle.
- Yeah.
Is that cool?
- I'm gonna put this
in my rock collection.
- That's a great idea.
Yeah.
Is that cool?
- Thank you, that's awesome.
(tropical beat music)
We're in Jamaica.
- Wah gwine muh yuh.
- We're in Jamaica.
Breakfast today with the family.
We are having a sit down
breakfast this morning,
of course with chocolate milk,
unlimited amounts of chocolate milk.
And look at this view.
This is our view, we are in Jamaica.
We are gonna go out there soon.
(lively steel drum music)
-  Jackson, we
made it to the beach.
-  Is that the ocean?
-  That is, are you
excited to go swimming in it?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
That's a good sport (laughs).
That is not where we're
going, don't worry.
-  Did we bring goggles?
-  Oh yes, we
definitely brought goggles.
- This is the Red Stripe Beach in Jamaica.
It is a private beach.
Not very many people are here at all.
This was like one of the excursions that
- A different cruise line.
-  Yeah.
- Disney didn't go here,
probably because it's really small, but
-  It's amazing.
There's not many people.
The food is like five star.
The sand
- It's like brown sugar.
- This is probably the best
beach, this and Florida.
I've been to a few beaches,
and those are my favorite.
And here we are.
Jared's gonna run out with Jackson,
'cause he's a daredevil.
(bright tropical beat music)
-  Get set, go!
(laughing)
- Look at this rock.
- Oh my gosh.
It's beautiful.
Alright Jackson and I have our loot.
You want to show them?
- Look at all the seashells.
-  This is everything
that Jackson and I just found.
Jackson one, that's the
best looking seashell.
Where did you find it?
Just right over there?
Honey.
- Did somebody say jerk chicken?
You know that's right.
Jerk chicken.
My brother Matt lived in
Jamaica for two years,
so he said, Jared, the one thing
that you have to do
while you're in Jamaica
is get some jerk chicken.
And you know that's right.
You know that's what I did.
Jackson, come try some jerk chicken.
You want some leg?
Mmm, that's some good jerk chicken.
- It's good, I like it.
-  Whoa, say yum yum in my tum tum.
- Yum yum in my tum tum.
-  Yeah.
Calvin say yum yum in my tum tum.
- Tum tum.
- You know what he always says
whenever he meets a character,
talk, talk more.
-  Yeah.
- He's surprised that they don't talk.
-  I know, it's so funny.
You want the guys to talk, huh Calvin.
- One two three.
(howling)
-  Jackson, what are you drawing?
- O.
-  O, show me an O.
That's an O, good job.
What letter is this?
- S.
-  S, that's right.
What letter is that.
- M.
-  That's right,
what letter is that?
- W!
-  That's right.
(howling)
(Jared laughing)
What does this say?
- Jackson.
-  That's right.
(laughing)
- He is so good.
- You want to see big mama grow?
(Jared laughing)
- He's only doing that
because she is requesting that.
Every night it's been the same.
He has to cut her food
and feed it to her.
- Who doesn't love a little
late night room service,
I sure do.
The boys are watching
- Stitch.
-  Stitch,
because we met him today.
- Yeah.
- So we are watching Stitch
and I ordered some room service.
I ordered one cookie, they gave me three,
so thumbs up for him.
And cheese pizza.
- I ordered three cookies.
-  You did?
I think I did.
- No I did.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Hey, hey did
you just drop your sucker
to eat the cookie?
Aww Calvin.
