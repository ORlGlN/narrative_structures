- Where is Cody?
(bright music)
Where is Cody?
- It is raging.
It is unforgiving.
It is the worst--
Duck duck goose.
- Wait, just kidding.
-  That's a bad example Mom.
- And I'm like oh my gosh.
He counts to three, jump.
- Baby!
-  Baby.
-  Do you want to hold the key?
The special key, don't lose it, okay?
- Okay.
-  What is it for,
to get into the pool?
(Ellie laughs)
Are we gonna go on a special date?
- Yep.
- What date are we gonna go on?
- Pool!
- Pool.
Calvin's taking a nap.
I think this is the clubhouse.
And Daddy is editing.
We are gonna go swim.
- Why are we walking?
- We're walking because it's not very far,
so we don't have to drive.
- Is this it?
- I think so.
This is the clubhouse.
And the pool is outdoor.
And it's actually kind of cold today
and I think it's heated,
from what I think,
so we're gonna weight for
our cousins to get here
and we'll open the door for them okay?
What do you think of it out there?
- It's great.
-  It's great.
That's awesome.
Let's go sit and wait.
(Jackson humming)
(lively music)
- Where is Cody?
Where is Cody?
Where is Cody?
Where is Cody?
Where is Cody?
Where's Cody?
- Cody is--
- Where's Cody?
-  He's coming back.
- Ah, I'm gonna eat my friends.
-  Don't eat your friends.
- I want to.
-  That would hurt them.
(laughing)
Cody's gonna be back soon.
Daddy has the biggest
headache in the world.
- Why?
-  So I told him to
close his eyes for a minute.
The kids are up for naps,
out of the pool,
climbing up a red mountain.
It's pretty sweet.
How cute are those boys.
Look at his little body.
What a fun little back yard.
They like to climb all the way to the top,
take rocks and throw them.
Have you had fun on our
little adventure getaway?
- Mmm-hmm.
- What has been your favorite part?
- Going at the water place.
- The water, that was fun.
Sneaky mister sneaker
pants, what are you doing?
(laughing)
- But I don't want to go yet.
- We're not gonna go.
We're gonna stay one more night.
- Forever?
- Not forever, just one more night.
- But I want to stay here forever.
- If we stay here forever,
we won't be able to come
back and have fun again.
- Well guys I tell ya, 2018
is already off to a start
and I'm not even quite sure
what kind of start it is just yet.
I just know that this headache that I have
is raging, it is unforgiving,
it is the worst, it is
the kind that is behind
your eyeballs that you just like uuuhhhh.
But I will power through it,
I will get through it,
because we're having fun today.
We're with our friends,
we're with our family,
we're having a blast.
But you know what they say,
new year, new me,
and I think a shower will help that,
because the 2017 Jared, is kinda stinky.
Oh I can feel 2017
(jazzy bright music)
just wash right off, woo!
♪ Tomorrow I'll miss you ♪
♪ You only get one shot ♪
♪ Do not miss your chance to blow ♪
♪ Opportunity comes once-- ♪
♪ Ave Maria ♪
Oh man, my head already
feels so much better.
My headache is nearly gone
and I'm pretty sure what happened
is I probably transferred my headache
to some of you, because of my singing,
so sorry about that, wasn't that great,
you probably got a headache.
New year, new headache.
Alrighty Joel, what do you think,
what do you think, what do you think?
- I like your shirt.
- Do you like it?
-  It's awesome.
- New year, new shirt.
And to everyone who doesn't like it,
you know what I have to say to them?
♪ Suck it ♪
♪ Suck it, suck it, suck it, ♪
♪ Come on suck ♪
-  Come hug him.
-  Are you guys
giving each other hugs?
- No Calvin's being a stinker.
Look, hug Lincoln.
- Hugs, awww.
- Hug so nice.
(Jared laughs)
- These two are some of
the most entertaining,
some of the most ferocious kids
I've ever seen.
They love each other,
they hate each other,
they love each other,
they hate each other.
They love each other,
and then what do you think happens?
No, they mutually respect each other,
then they hate each other,
that's what happens.
It's a cyclical pattern
that they're going through.
- I don't want you guys to fall forward
and hit your teeth.
-  That would be so bad.
- Like that.
-  There you go.
Duck duck goose.
- Wait, just kidding.
-  That's a bad example, Mom.
- No more, stop.
-  How about
yeah yeah, there we go.
(Jared laughing)
(boys laughing)
-  Laughing in the new year.
-  Yay!
New year, new babies.
Wait a second, new year, new baby.
- See who wins.
Jared's gonna play Mario--
- Is that a challenge?
- with Cody.
- Are you challenging me?
- Oh yeah, did you grow up with one?
- Oh well yeah, but it was on its way out
when I was a kid.
- We both grew up with those.
We loved 'em, Beau's really good.
Cody and Jared and whoever loses first,
I get to play with, okay?
- New year, new challenge.
- So I want to give you guys
a quick little baby update.
So I told you guys quite a while ago,
that I'm pretty sure I felt the baby,
definitely know what it feels like
with the other two pregnancies.
I totally have felt flutters,
but last night was the first night,
at midnight or at one
o'clock, it was at 1:00 AM,
I was sitting there and I was like,
that was the baby.
It wasn't just like a flutter,
I felt like a full blown on my left side,
totally movement, like that was the baby
and then today I have felt a few flutters
and I'm like oh my gosh so,
14 weeks, 14 and a half weeks,
feeling the baby, it's awesome.
Cody's going first, you're
doing good Code boy.
- He's already kicking my butt
and I haven't even started playing.
-  This is awesome.
Hi Cal.
Let's see what the other kids are doing.
As you can tell,
today we are just,
this is what we're doing all day.
We're going room to room.
You're playing, you guys
got superpowers, huh?
What?
- Uh-huh.
-  Okay, be careful.
-  Watch this.
-  Oh, here I'll get it.
You guys are just throwing
the hats back and forth?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.
Oh that's good.
-  Cody's giving you
all the instructions Ellie.
- I know.
-  You're like
oh I don't need to know,
I know where all the mushrooms are.
- I'll tell you a secret on it.
-  Ooh, I love a secret.
- I know a secret.
- Every time we play a video game,
Ellie's just like, I just
want to play original Mario.
- Yeah.
- That's all I want to do.
- Everybody's like, you
want to play a game with me,
well they're kind of
lame to be, unless it's--
-  Mario?
(yelling)
- Unless it's--
- You don't get the secret because
you can't break anymore.
- Okay, it was Mario
64 is a really fun one.
And the classic, this one.
- That's a really fun one.
- If you like Mario 64,
I think you'll really
like Super Mario Odyssey.
Super Mario Odyssey is like
one of my favorite games ever.
- Have I seen you play that?
- Yeah I think so, yeah.
Okay, I said it before,
but the Nintendo Switch is honestly
one of my favorite consoles,
because it's just like--
-  Yeah, even Jackson loves it.
- I don't have to put
gaming into my schedule,
it can go with me, wherever I go,
so that's pretty fun.
And Breath of the Wild,
probably that, the Last of Us
and Final Fantasy VII
are probably my three top
favorite games of all time.
- What's the one I bought for you
when we were in college?
-  The Last of Us.
- Yeah it was right after
Jared had graduated.
I was doing grocery shopping
and I knew he had wanted it for so long,
and I came home and I
surprised him with it.
- And that was one of the
most genuine surprises
I've ever had.
-  He was so happy.
- I had no idea she was
even going to do it.
We couldn't afford a video game.
Like $60 bucks, we couldn't afford one.
-  Right out of college.
- Yeah and there it was
when I walked in the door,
and it was just like the coolest thing.
I think I stayed up all night playing it.
It was so much fun.
Those are fun memories.
- I love it.
And I love this even more.
Let's see how long this lasts, oh!
(laughing)
(yells)
- Don't rage quit.
- Oh, uh-uh.
-  Don't.
- Hey, we don't do that
to other peoples' toys.
-  You probably
didn't have to laugh,
but I think even you laughed.
- I don't like dying.
- Me either.
- I know, dying is not fun.
-  Okay, Cody's turn.
- I want to be on a different level.
- Okay, Dad's gonna help you.
- Okay, we'll get better.
- We'll start with the easier one.
- You just are learning how to play stuff,
so it's kind of hard sometimes, huh?
Look at Mom though.
We don't want to hurt Cody's toy,
so don't throw it, okay?
- Let's be honest, we've all been there
playing video games.
You just want to throw the controls down.
- I used to bend the remote.
Like we'd get so mad, we'd bend it.
Or I'd get so mad, I would
throw it at Julie's forehead
and leave a dent in her forehead.
- Oh geez, such love.
- Don't do that Jacks.
- And this is the babies' games.
I shouldn't even call you babies anymore.
What did you just say
when you jumped Calvin?
- One two baby a back baby--
-  He counts to three.
- Baby!
-  Baby!
- Mommy.
-  All of you kids,
what are your new year goals?
-  Everyone, look at the sun.
-  Where's the
sun, look in the sun.
That's what we do.
- Don't point to it, look at it.
- It's good for you.
Look at the sun.
-  We did it on the eclipse day,
we're gonna do it again.
-  Are you
excited for the new year?
- Yeah.
-  What's your goal?
To be five?
- To be five, to turn five.
-  That'd be cool.
-  Well that's a
good achievable goal, honey.
-  Four?
Okay, I think you could turn four.
This is pretty, we're going
on a little walk tonight.
That is the rolls.
- And the veggie.
- So round two of the party time.
So this is what's going on.
We had dinner takeout and we went
to this amazing place called Benja's
and actually I've been there before
when we were filming
with Geekafies down here
in St. George, Geekify Guys,
and it was really great.
So Carl and Jinger were like,
let's do this again,
and we're like, okay perfect.
So we each got a meal,
and when we got there,
they're like oh you guys are the ones
who ordered all the food.
And we're like yeah, I guess that's us,
the name is Jared, under Jared,
and they're like okay, yeah perfect.
- Six meals is the law, I guess.
- Yeah and we're like okay whatever.
And then another lady was like
have you guys been helped yet,
is everything okay?
And we're like yeah, we're
waiting for an order for Jared.
Oh you guys are the ones that ordered
a lot of food,
and I'm like, I mean guess,
I mean it's a pretty normal amount,
there's three of us here,
we have three spouses
at home, no big deal.
And then the waitress is like,
we done goofed, we goofed up guys,
but don't worry, it's benefiting you.
I'm like what's going on,
they're like, we ordered
double of everything
but we're not charging you for it,
so we have twice the amount of food.
- She charged for the
regular food though, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
We almost tried walking out
to see if we could get two for none.
No I'm kidding.
But we got twice the amount of food,
so we're gonna have
twice the amount of fun
and twice the amount of poops.
Okay, deal?
- Yeah!
- Hands in everyone.
- We can't leave the table
'til this food is gone.
(laughing)
- Boy I have no idea
where the evening went.
Everyone went to bed,
and Carl and Jinger left.
It was so good to see them
and tomorrow we leave.
But today was the very first day of 2018
and we did what our
favorite thing to do is,
is be with family and friends
and just enjoy each other's company.
And I imagine we'll do
that quite a bit this year.
But not only that.
I think there's some big
stuff coming this year in 2018
and I can't wait for you to see it
and be a part of it.
So with that, we're gonna call it a night.
We just sat around here,
talked about YouTube.
(laughs)
And talked about our kids
and it was a lot of fun.
So thank you guys so much for watching.
