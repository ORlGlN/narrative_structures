(cascading coins)
- Whoa!
- That's a lot of money.
- Jackson and I are gonna go
do something fun right now.
He's got a big smile on his face.
Hey, you ready?
Is it everything you hoped and dreamed of?
So at lunch today, we had our superheroes
all along the bench
and it was so cute.
-  This is too cute to not record.
Look how cute these guys are?
- We had Spiderman, Spiderman,
Buzz Lightyear and Captain Underpants,
because Calvin was in his underpants
because he's doing potty training
and that was just the sweetest
thing during lunchtime.
Please forgive the interruption
in your regular programming,
I wanted to make you
aware of some big news.
I have been tweeting back and forth
with YouTube about notifications
and notifications are
not working that well
on YouTube right now.
So I just wanted to come in
and hop in real quick
and let you guys know,
if you haven't already, make sure you hit
that red subscribe button
and the bell notification
right next to it.
YouTube has been having some
issues getting our videos
into your subscription boxes
and the best way to make sure
that you know exactly when we have
a video go live, is hitting
that bell notification
right next to the subscribe button.
That sends a push
notification to your phone
that tells you we have a video go live
and it's usually the fastest.
So if you wouldn't mind doing me a favor,
hit that subscribe button,
hit the bell notification,
so you guys won't miss a video ever again.
Hopefully, crossing our fingers,
YouTube said that should
help a lot with that
so thank you guys so much for doing that
and again, sorry for the interruption,
back to our regularly programmed schedule.
Today Jackson and I have something planned
that we want to do.
We mentioned that we wanted
to get his piggy bank
all situated and take all of the coins,
because it's so heavy
and cash them in and we're
grateful that a lot of you guys,
we mentioned going to Coinstar,
we're grateful that a lot of you mentioned
that there's a big fee
associated with that,
so we're gonna go to a bank instead.
So Jackson, we haven't really talked
about this too much,
but do you want to know,
we're gonna do something fun today.
Come with me.
So in here, oh my goodness.
It's so heavy.
Jackson, your piggy bank
is so heavy, come here.
Try and hold it.
Can you lift it?
Is it heavy?
- Nope.
- You're so strong, oh look at you.
It's pretty heavy though, huh?
Don't drop it on your
toe, that would be so bad.
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna put all of the money
and we're gonna take it out
and we're gonna put it in a bag.
We're gonna take that bag to the bank
and they're gonna make them
into bills, dollar bills.
And we'll put them back
in your piggy bank,
because this is full of money and coins
and it's heavy and we're
gonna make 'em bills,
so you can fit more inside of here.
- What do we do with this?
-  That's for the combination,
so you can unlock it.
That's pretty cool, huh?
So no one takes your money.
- Yep.
- Yep.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Should we go do that today?
Should we go to the bank and do this?
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go get
it and put it in a bag.
- Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
- Okay, so I think what will be easiest
for us and the bank
is to take all--
oh my gosh it's heavy,
all of the money in here--
- But I can hold it.
- Yeah and we'll put
the coins in each bag,
so we'll put pennies in one bag,
we'll put nickels in another bag,
we'll dimes in another bag,
quarters in another bag
and we'll call that good.
Take it in so it's
easier for them to count.
(Jackson groans)
It's heavy huh?
So let's see how we can
figure out, oh my goodness,
how to open this.
(gasps)
We did it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah oh look, this is
money that Mom and Dad got
while we were in China.
Is that pretty cool?
Look at all this money.
Should we pour it out on the table?
(cascading coins)
Whoa!
- That's a lot of money.
- Look at all these bills
you got in here too.
Oh my gosh, here's a five dollar bill.
Do you know how much
a five dollar bill is?
- Mmm-hmm.
- A five dollar bill is
five one dollar bills.
Do you know how many a one dollar bill is?
- No.
- It's four of these quarters.
Do you know how much a quarter is?
Is two and a half of these dimes.
Do you know how much a dime is?
It's two of these nickels.
Do you know how many nickels are these?
It's five of these pennies.
And that's how money works.
This one is called a penny.
All these brown ones are called copper.
We're gonna put 'em in this bag.
So I want you to find all of these ones
and we'll put 'em in this bag, okay?
- Okay.
Oh I have another one.
- Okay, put it in this bag.
- Oh what is this?
- That is, oh that is, a game token.
We'll put that one aside.
For like an arcade.
- Mom!
-  What?
- You have to check this out on the table!
(Jared laughs)
(gasps)
- What?
It couldn't fit one more coin,
it was full.
- So full.
- Okay, organize this all up.
- Yep.
Okay I think we got all of
the pennies in one pile.
Now Jackson, I want you to
grab this bag right here.
I want you to hold it
open right here, okay?
And then I will scoop these pennies in,
so hold it right underneath the table.
-  Okay.
(cascading coins)
-  Oh I'm dropping some.
Ah!
Okay, we'll pick up the rest on the floor.
Whoa, don't drop the bag!
Oh wow, yeah we did drop a lot.
(lively music)
(coins clinking)
Nice.
Now we'll seal this up
woop, and we'll do nickels.
- Is this a nickel?
-  That is a nickel, good job.
-  Since he was one years old,
this is what his piggy
bank has accumulated to.
- I feel like he has more
money in this piggy bank
than I ever got until I was 12 years old.
Okay we got our nickel bag,
no pun intended.
I'm sure the bank has a sorting machine,
but this is just fun for me and my son
to do together.
Is this fun buddy?
- Yep.
- Yep yep, and we're learning
about the coins too as we go.
Can you show me a quarter?
Yeah, can you show me a dime?
Yep, there you go, good job bud.
So we've got dimes, quarters, nickels,
pennies and then all of these
dolla dolla bills ya'll.
Here's my question Jackson,
we have all of this money right here
in all of these bags,
how much money do you think there is here?
I would like to know what your guess is.
So we've got all of these pennies,
we've got all of these nickels,
we've got all of these quarters
and we've got all of these dimes.
And we've got a few various bills here.
My guess is that we have
$63 dollars, that's my guess, $63 dollars.
- 63?
-  Yep, that's my guess.
What's your guess?
- 69.
- 69?
You're kinda going the Price is Right
and you're going a little bit above me
without going over, huh?
How much do you think
are in those bags?
- I can tell he went to Grandma's.
Oh these are quarters.
-  Yeah, that is a lot of quarters.
- Usually if Jackson sees a quarter,
he'll be like can I put this?
This is all from Grandma.
-  Yep.
- She gave him for his birthday.
-  All those nickels,
she had a roll of nickels
that she gave.
- I bet he has $70 dollars.
- $70 dollars?
Okay, we're all thinking
about the same thing.
I said 63, Jackson said 69
and you say 70.
Okay buddy, are you ready to do this?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, can you hold these?
You got 'em?
Oh oh!
How about Dad helps you a little, oh!
You know what, this is
pretty cool Jackson,
- Uh-huh.
-  This is all the
money that you've earned
doing chores, from your birthdays,
all of that, we're gonna
make em into bills.
Okay look, that's our
counting machine right there.
We're gonna put 'em all in there
and see how many we have, okay?
So put these ones on the 10,
because they're a dime.
Okay, can you do that?
Okay we're almost done,
we've got one two three
of those almost filled Jackson.
Can you even believe that?
-  All of the
change, is coming out
to $49 dollars and 63 cents.
-  She's gonna
count the dollar bills now.
(counting machine clicking)
whoa, that's cool.
$37 dollars.
-  Guess what, are
you ready for the total?
$85 dollars and 83 cents.
-  Oh my gosh.
Good job buddy.
- That is a lot of money.
- That is so much, good job.
- Yay!
- That's great bud.
Are you gonna put it all
back in your piggy bank?
- No.
(laughing)
-  He's like I'm gonna spend that.
- I'm gonna spend it.
We'll talk about that.
Good job bud.
There you go Jackson.
-  Look I'm even gonna give you
some change back.
-  Can you believe that?
-  Look, you want
some change back too?
That's what's left over.
There you go.
Should we get you a
special envelope for it?
-  That's a great idea.
-  Here.
- I cannot even believe that Jackson,
that is so great.
You've got your special little envelope.
That's fun, huh.
So you know what Mommy and I do?
Every month when we get paid,
we put money in savings,
like your piggy bank.
We give some money to those who need it
and then we take a little bit
and we have some fun.
And so I have in my pocket a few quarters.
- And a treat, and a special treat.
- And we're gonna go do something special.
I'm so proud of you, that's my boy,
it's like you won the
lottery Jackson, good job.
-  Hi.
- Hi, how are ya?
-  Good, you sound happy.
- Well yeah, guess how much
Jackson had in his piggy bank?
-  How much?
- Do you wanna tell her?
- 87.
-  What?
- $87 dollars, can you believe that?
I talked to Jackson, I said
when Mommy and Daddy get paid,
we put a lot of that money
right back into savings
and then we give some
money to those who need it
and then we take a little bit of it
and we go something fun,
and Jackson and I are gonna
do something fun right now.
-  Cool.
- Yeah.
- Have fun.
- He's got a big smile on his face.
Hey, you ready?
Okay love you.
So Jackson, when we come to Walmart,
we don't usually have quarters with us.
And what do you always want to do
with quarters in Walmart?
Yep, go on the rides.
So guess what, you can finally do that
because you have quarters.
Do you want to pick a ride
or pick a machine and do it?
- I want to do
this!
-  Oh the
motorcycle, that looks cool.
Oh no, it's out of order.
Shoot, we'll have to pick a different one.
Pumbaa?
- Yep.
-  Alright, it's 50
cents, that's two quarters.
So put those in and you can go for a ride.
One, do one at a time,
there you got one, there
you go, hold on tight.
Enjoy the ride.
Whoa.
(Jared laughs)
(bright music)
Is it everything you hoped and dreamed of?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, you like it?
- I'm gonna do this one.
-  Okay, this
is a Ghostbusters ride.
(bright music)
You put 'em right in here, one at a time.
Now these crane games are kinda tricky.
We should probably call Sam
and ask him for some help.
Move it where you want it.
And then when you're ready
to push it, push the button.
Ooooh.
No, darnit, we were so close.
Okay, that's it.
High five, good job bud.
Jackson, you have worked so hard
to fill up that piggy bank, haven't you?
- Uh-huh.
- And Calvin is working
so hard on potty training.
- Uh-huh.
- So one of the things we're gonna grab
here at the store, we're gonna grab
some little prizes for Calvin
for when he goes potty in the toilet,
we'll give him a little prize.
Will you help me pick some of those out?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Toy out for Calvin.
-  You're gonna pick a toy out?
That sounds like a nice thing to do
for your brother.
- We have to go all the way back there.
- Okay.
So we want to just get little
little victories for Calvin.
So things like oh,
I like these little surprise toys,
because you don't know what's inside.
So we'll get a couple Comics.
- A mash 'em, Dad!
-  And maybe a couple Toy Story.
- Mashem!
I got a Mashem.
-  A Mashem?
- Uh-huh.
-  I think that could work.
Here's some more Mashems.
Pick a cool one for Calvin.
Spiderman's all the way up here.
(lively guitar music)
So like I said earlier,
Mommy and Daddy do some things
with the money that we earn.
And we think that it's a pretty good thing
to keep money into savings
for what's called a
rainy day, just in case.
And it's nice to put
this in your piggy bank
so you have it.
So you keep it in a safe spot.
I mean if you invest this smart,
maybe put it in an aggressive growth stock
mutual fund that has a 12% return
over the last hundred years,
you could be a millionaire
by the time you're five.
So Jackson, now that you
have money in dollar bills,
how do you feel?
(Jared laughing)
Did you have a fun day with Daddy today.
Good, we got a lot done.
And we did a big goal for you.
This was cool.
I hope you remember this for a long time.
And I hope you remember
the principals we taught
and the Mashems that we got.
And the rhymes we make
and the time we take.
I'm a rhyming machine,
now if only I could get lean.
Can you say goodnight to our friends?
- Goodnight.
- That is is for us today.
While some of us are hunkering down
in the bathroom going
through potty training
and getting that done and taken care of,
others are doing things
like getting AirPods
out of the car or taking kids to the bank
to, changing their money,
so today's been a pretty fun day
and I'm just grateful for my family
and I'm grateful for my parents
and the things that they taught me
so I can teach those things to my kids
with my wife, and I'm grateful for that.
I'm grateful that Ellie's pregnant.
She has been feeling great
and I'm very happy about that.
So with that, I hope you
guys are feeling great,
I hope you have a wonderful day
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
Thanks for watching, bye.
