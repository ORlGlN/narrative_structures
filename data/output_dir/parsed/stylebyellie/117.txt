(Jared laughing)
(Jackson yelling)
- Jackson (laughs),
I'm waiting for a good moment to talk,
'cause he's singing while
he's going to the bathroom.
We just got back from church
and I just took my nylons off.
I texted Julie and I was like,
I am not wearing nylons anymore.
I need to buy some nylons.
(Jackson singing)
Well it's cold here, so I
really want to wear nylons.
I need to buy like knee high
or like thigh high nylons.
I've been at church and I brought snacks
and my nylons were digging in my stomach
and it hurt so bad.
Jackson, can you guys hear him singing?
So I have to buy some nylons.
I need to look them up now,
so I don't forget.
So next Sunday I won't like be hurting.
And usually on Sundays, we
really try not to go out.
We don't go out to eat,
we usually don't hang out with friends.
Like we really just were home,
we go to church and we come home
and just spend time together.
And usually I have a meal cooked,
but I've been having a really hard time
cooking the last few days,
just smells, being in
the kitchen, standing.
I've been getting a lot
of salads and eating.
I've got Costa Vida, I've ate,
that's been yummy.
It's just like whatever
sounds good in the moment,
that's what I eat,
and I brought some--
I'm like shaking right now.
Can you tell I'm shaking?
I went to church, or I ate,
I went to church, and I
brought some snacks to church,
and then 10 minutes before we got out,
I was like, I need to eat now,
I need to eat now,
and on the way home from church,
I'm like, well let's just
stop and get mashed potatoes,
gravy and cole slaw from KFC,
so that's what I've been eating
and it tastes so good to me.
(laughs)
But I'm still just shaky
because I'm hungry.
And I told one of my friends at church,
I was like, I'm sorry for the text
I sent so late at night.
I fell asleep, in my robe, in my jammies,
on top of the bed last night,
because I get so dizzy at night,
just so dizzy.
And I take my pre-natal pills at night,
but I never noticed
that it makes me dizzy.
So I don't know if it's just right now
taking pre-natal pills at night
that's making me dizzy,
or if it's me just being dizzy.
But I was so dizzy,
and I fell asleep and
then I woke up at 11,
wandered to the bathroom
and then was texting everyone back
that had texted me between seven and 10,
not realizing it was so late.
And it was I just like,
I just felt kinda dumb so.
I'm in my element now.
I feel better.
I'm just sitting eating.
(laughing)
I feel like a little hot mess.
Hi.
- Hi.
There are two truths to that statement,
you are little and you are hot.
0hhh (laughs).
- You are a dork.
Jared's charging his drone.
- Wee.
- We're gonna
-  Hi.
- Hi.
-  Do you need us to wipe you up?
- I just wiped.
-  You did?
Did Dad help?
-  Mmm-hmm.
-  Okay, let's wash
your hands and we'll eat.
- Yes we're grabbing the drones,
and we're taking them over
to the neighbor's house.
So they can try the drones.
- They can look at--
- and see what they like.
- And see what they like.
- We're gonna drone neighbor house?
- Okay, let's wipe you up.
- Yeah, you wanna come?
-  Let's wipe you up.
-  Let's wash
your hands, come here.
- By saying let's wipe you up,
I'm saying Daddy wipe you up,
because I don't know if I can get up.
Shut up right now.
- We'll all do a community,
but you do it Dad.
(laughs)
- I'm gonna finish eating.
- Hey bud.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
- I'm rescue droning.
(drone buzzing)
- You're rescue droning?
Jackson and I just finished
with the neighbors.
We were showing them the drone.
And Jackson is flying DJI Spark right now,
and he's actually doing
really really good.
Are you having fun, bud?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
- He's flying this drone all by himself
and he's doing awesome.
I'm so proud of him.
Good job bud.
Jackson and I just got back inside
from flying the drones
And I can't find Ellie anywhere,
but I think she's in the bedroom resting.
It is six o'clock at night,
and Calvin fell asleep on
the way home from church.
That was like at 4:00 PM.
So he's been asleep for two hours.
That means Calvin is either gonna wake up
really early this evening
and have a really late night,
or he's gonna sleep through all of this
and wake up super early in the morning.
And I have no idea what to do.
- Ice skating.
- What do you do in that situation?
- Ice skating.
-  Oh is that what
you do in that situation,
you ice skate with two rags on your feet?
- Yeah.
-  That seems like a good idea.
("The Nutcracker, Dance of the Mirlitons")
But now you guys know more or less
why Ellie has been
caught sleeping so much.
It's because she's pregnant.
40 minutes later, he's finally awake.
(laughs) Jackson what are we watching?
- Willie and the Chocolate Factory.
- Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
And what did you tell me you wanted to do?
- I want to jump in the
TV and go see Wonka.
- You want to go in the TV and see Wonka?
Do you like the factory?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I want to live there too, buddy.
- Yeah.
-  What would you
do with all that chocolate?
- Eat it.
- Eat it?
