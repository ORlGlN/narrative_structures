- I don't even know who he is anymore!
What?
What?
You're crazy!
- So Ellie thinks that this
is the right thing for me.
- Shh.
Okay guys, I think that
we need to have a talk.
I am so in love with Jared.
He has always been there for me.
He's always been there for my family.
If something comes up,
he is there to help.
He is so good at, his calling at church,
everybody loves that he's energetic
and he's playful with the kids
and he just has the perfect personality
and the biggest heart
and he's always willing to
put others before himself,
but I have bene noticing some
changes with Jared lately
and I've been keeping my eye on him
and I feel like these
changes that he's been making
is not true to himself
and is really not true to us.
I'm in Jared's office
and I've noticed that this
is where most of his changes
have been happening.
And I just opened up his fridge
and no Dr. Pepper.
Zero calories, no sugar,
no artificial sweeteners?
What is this?
I'm not even sure that
I like these changes,
because it's not the Jared that I know
and it's starting to make me worried.
We have had four cases
of Dr. Pepper for weeks
and they haven't even moved.
(top popping)
I don't even know who he is anymore!
Jared has changed so much,
I don't even like looking
at his clothes anymore.
All of his free stupid t-shirts,
I want them gone!
These pants, he has had these pants
for four or five years.
He used to wear them every day in sales.
I want them gone, all of them,
I just want you to look nice!
I am not even mad.
He deserves this,
he's been changing right in front of me
and I'm throwing all of these out.
These are going.
Good bye.
("Mozart's Requiem")
in all seriousness, I love Jared,
I adore Jared and he
has been making changes.
Just small simple changes
lead to huge changes
and I've seen that with Jared.
He's been working out in the mornings.
He's been waking up early,
getting videos, getting work done,
he's been trying to eat better.
I just can see a huge difference in Jared
and I'm very proud of him.
But I will say it is true,
a lot of the shirts that he wears
is the free t-shirts that he's got
and he even himself wants to vamp up
and I want to treat him
to a day of just Jared.
Let's go shopping,
I'm gonna give you tons
of clothes to try on,
even if you normally
wouldn't wear those clothes,
I want him just to have a day
where it's me and him,
we're gonna go to lunch,
we're gonna go shopping
and I love Jared and I'm proud of him.
So, with that said, shall we go?
I am proud of you.
- Thank you.
- I am proud.
Well the other day, so
I've been doing really good
at drinking water and
the other day I was like,
we should got to Swig and
get a cookie and a drink.
- You were having a craving.
- And so we went and got a drink
and we pulled away and I was like,
where's your drink and he was like,
I didn't get one and I was like, what?
What?
You're crazy!
- I skipped out on Swig.
I know, it's like the
craziest thing I've ever done.
You guys know I love Swig and
Dr. Pepper and all that stuff,
but by small and simple things
some great things come to pass, right?
-  Yeah.
You look really different.
- Do I?
-  The lighting.
- Oh, not like my shape.
(Ellie laughs)
- Where do you want to start Jared?
- Oh probably the beginning,
that seems like a very
good place to start.
- Okay, let's go.
- So Ellie thinks that this
is the right thing for me
and I am going to go along with it, but--
-  Whatever, you are just as happy.
Shorts, pants, we'll see.
- We'll just have to see how this looks.
So you guys ready for
a little fashion show?
Starring me.
(lively music)
(dramatic music)
(playful music)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
I'm short.
I don't get it.
Why are shirts, this is a sweater,
why does it only go to my belt?
If I wash this,
that is not flattering at all,
no one wants to see this.
Why do companies do this?
I'm short and this is a medium.
I don't get it, am I
missing something here?
Like am I missing something?
Something?
- It's the story of our lives.
- It's not even a good one.
-  Progress.
- Aaaay.
I like this a lot.
- You look crisp.
- I like this a lot Ellie.
-  Well you look ravishing.
Woo hoo.
- Do I look pretty good?
-  Yeah.
- I think these are a little
too wide at the bottom.
-  Ready for church.
Yeah.
- But I like it.
(gentle guitar music)
-  Crazy huh?
-  Mmm-hmm.
-  Four months.
-  I still can't
believe you're pregnant.
(Jared laughs)
-  Kids are so fun to shop for
and Jared.
- Oh thank you.
- If you guys want to smell
like a baby's bottom, Tom Ford.
Even the sales associate agreed.
- It's like baby powder.
(laughs)
- No.
- Hey, here's a trophy you earned it.
Or would you rather have the bulge.
(Ellie laughs)
Palate has been cleansed.
-  Get scratchin' and sniffin'.
- This is good.
-  That's my favorite.
- Smell me.
You like it?
-  I do.
(bright music)
- Okay, so today is
actually a very special day,
not just because of what
Ellie and I did earlier,
but because today is
the two year anniversary
of my parents living in Utah.
And it's a very exciting night
and it's something that they actually
invited us to dinner to.
And they told us, while
we were in Salt Lake,
we are wearing nice clothing,
so just an FYI.
Ellie already looks amazing with her coat
and sweater and everything--
-  Good thing we
just bought you clothes.
- and we just bought me clothes,
so I am in the back seat
and I'm looking through all the clothes
that I just got.
- This looks nice.
- This sweater, right there?
That looks nice with that jacket?
I've got some slacks,
I've got these slacks I'm gonna wear.
So I hope Mom and Dad are okay with this,
because I probably would've
dressed nicer had I known,
but we're about to go
into a very sweet dinner
with my Mom and Dad.
It's snowing like crazy right now.
You can't really tell.
And it's like, anticlimactic,
but it's snowing a lot.
Alright, before we get any
further in this dinner,
Dad has some rules about the table
that we're gonna go over.
- Every electronic's going in the bag.
- Yeah my watch just went off.
What are the other rules Dad?
- Phones off.
-  Yes.
- And you can have whatever's
on the menu you want,
like anything.
- Oh my gosh.
- Anything.
- Anything?
- So that's including food.
We can get whatever food we want.
- Of course.
-  Okay, alright.
- No unlimited amount of Dr. Pepper.
(Jared sighs)
- Don't worry, I have been
doing good with that, haven't I?
I know I haven't been loyal.
I feel like I've missed you all day
my sweet Penny girl.
You have been such a good girl.
And I feel like I've missed you guys.
I haven't been really a huge part,
well I guess a huge part,
but I haven't talked to you today.
And I feel like that's been missing.
But I just wanted to say how much
I enjoyed today.
Ellie and I are trying to work hard
on doing a date night once a week
and I feel like today
totally counts for that.
Especially that we were able
to get to spend some time with my parents.
And this has been two years
since they moved to Utah.
I cannot believe that over two years ago,
we went to Spokane and
helped them move here.
Like that blows my mind,
because it feels like
it was just yesterday,
especially all of the
siblings getting together
and saying goodbye to our house
that we grew up in.
It was so cool.
I love that my parents are here.
I feel like they're our neighbors
and I love that our
kids, Jackson and Calvin,
love that Grandma and Grandpa are here,
that's the coolest thing to me.
And I'm so grateful that they're here,
and I'm so grateful that they have enjoyed
living next to us,
because I don't know, maybe
sometimes we're not the greatest
neighbors in the whole entire world.
Maybe we are, I don't know,
We'll let them be the judge of that.
- Today was a great day.
Cheers.
-  Cheers.
- Let's go to bed and watch a show.
-  Absolutely.
Ending our night the best
way that we know how,
with a little Flash.
No, not that kind of Flash, Ellie, no.
Like a little Barry Allen,
the fastest man alive.
Anyway guys, thanks so much for watching.
