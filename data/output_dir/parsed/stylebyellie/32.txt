- It does not matter,
Jared, you're not coaching anymore.
Put this away.
-  Oh my goodness,
Jackson has got it.
Oh no, and we told ya to leave the kids.
Thanks for breakfast Jared.
- You're welcome, sweet wife.
- Thanks for doing the dishes.
- You're welcome, sweet wife.
- Thanks for tolerating me
even though I have crazy,
freaky pregnancy dreams.
- Your pregnancy dreams
are out of this world!
- I have gone through 8,000 photos
that I have organized into
Jackson, Calvin, Christmas,
house, Penny, all of these folders
and now I'm importing
4,000 more to go through.
Holy cow, that's what
you get when you never
organize your photos in 10 years, so.
- Ellie, I'm sorry to
say we're not even close.
We still have four more hard
drives to go through too.
(bright music)
- This is our trap.
-  For what?
- For that.
-  For the robot, kay.
- Hello and welcome to my closet.
A couple days ago,
Ellie told you about how
she went through some bins
or maybe she didn't, I can't remember.
Anyway, we've had some
bins in the storage room
and we've kinda wanted
to consolidate them down
to smaller containers,
get rid of things that
we don't want anymore,
just unnecessary things
that are taking up space
and this bin right here,
(groans)
it's 50 pounds, is my bin.
And there's some things in it
and I want to go over a
couple of those things,
just to reminisce and go
down memory lane with you.
The first thing that I see here,
this backpack, is like my
favorite backpack of all time.
It's a Hagl√∂fs backpack.
I think they make them in Sweden,
but I got this when I lived in Finland.
I'm gonna keep this backpack forever,
because it reminds me
of living in Finland.
I think one of these days I'll go over
my stay in Finland more,
and more specifically about my feelings
about Finland and coming
home from Finland.
But there's one thing in particular
that I wanted to show you that's
really kinda special to me
that you guys don't know a ton about.
It's before Ellie and I were married.
I was huge into pole vaulting.
Pole vaulting was my
favorite sport of all time.
I started doing pole
vaulting about half way
through high school and I actually went
to college for pole vaulting
and then all of my hip
injuries caught up with me.
And then, after I couldn't compete,
I actually started
coaching the women's team
at the college I went to.
And during that time,
I wrote a technical manual
on the best technique
you can do to pole vaulting
and why the other techniques
aren't as good as this.
We call it the 640 model or 21 feet.
Using this technical model,
we believe that you can pole vault 21 feet
and the world record
right now is 6.15 meters,
which is almost 20 feet, two inches.
So Sergey Bubka in my opinion
is the greatest pole vaulter in the world.
Using this model, he could
have pole vaulted 21 feet.
And I wrote a manual on it.
(laughs)
Isn't that crazy?
And I was going to published,
like I was going to have this published,
but I just, I never did.
But this is my manual,
it's really special to me too.
Let's see what else we've got in here.
Well this is a throw back,
this is a 360 camera for the iPhone 4.
My brother Nate got this
for me for Christmas.
See and just things like this.
These are just the iPhone 5s boxes
that Ellie and I got a long time ago.
These are in here, so we don't need
to keep these anymore, but
we've had them for awhile.
I usually keep all the stickers
and stuff in there, so let's
see if those are in here.
I talked about that in my
HomePod unboxing video.
Yep, here they are.
(laughs)
Who keeps a laptop box?
Right?
Who keeps an iPad box?
I don't know, I guess I do.
Do you keep a lot of these things
when you get stuff?
Oh my gosh, here's a portable charger.
I should probably actually use this.
Here we go.
Suomi, Englanti, Suomi.
(Ellie laughs)
I'm going though some of my stuff.
Hey,
-  Hey.
- let's learn a Finnish word together.
- Okay.
(speaking in foreign language)
What's a word that you
want to learn in Finnish?
-  Puppy.
- Puppy?
-  Or dog.
- Okay, I know dog, let's learn puppy.
Dog in Finnish is koira.
(barking)
Puppy, koiran.
(Ellie laughs)
So it's like the--
- Koiran.
- It's like the koiran.
- Koiran.
- Or pentu.
-  I'm gonna call Penny koiran.
- Nulkki, nulikka, something like that.
I just wanted to show a
couple things in here.
Just go down memory lane real quick.
I wanted to show this 640
technical pole vaulting manual,
because it's not something
that you guys know
about me very well is my athletic history.
Controlled run up, free pole drop,
early controlled plant, last three steps,
free take off, the free
take off is very important.
Solid position and take off and inversion
and that's the other thing
is the inversion phase is just something
that people don't really
take into consideration
when they're pole vaulting.
Obviously they're thinking about it,
but it's about the
execution of the inversion.
You don't know, it doesn't matter.
It does not matter.
Jared you're not coaching anymore.
Put this away.
I hope you enjoyed going
down memory lane with me.
- If Jackson wants to do something,
he figures out a way to get it done.
He put on his shoes, socks, hat and coat
and he said I want to play with a friend,
can I go over to so and so's house.
And I was like, get on your bike,
I watched him through the window
ride to his friends
and he's not riding his
bike home with his friend,
he's walking his bike
home with his friend,
because his friend didn't have a bike.
Okay, see ya in a minute.
(laughing)
- And they all go down there ah!
(laughing)
Did our parents ever feel like that?
When we did stuff like that?
-  Oh I'm sure.
- Ah!
- But that was so, funny and sweet
seeing him not just ride his bike,
he walked it next to his friend.
That's cute.
So is Chase and Marshall
over there kissin'.
So cute.
- Chase is on the case.
(howling)
- I think her face is
hilarious when she scratches.
Her smile is so cute when she does that.
- You should see your face
when I give you a back massage.
- So tonight, Emily and Beau invited
the whole family over, no kids allowed,
to a little fondue party.
And we just happen to have a fondue pot.
So thank you Jared.
He went and grabbed a
ton of veggies to steam.
When we go tot he Melting
Pot that does fondue,
they never steam the veggies,
it's just raw veggies
and it really isn't that great,
so I think it'll be really
good to steam those.
- I never realized,
we buy one type of
cheese, cheddar cheese--
-  And it's like three bucks.
- Yeah and we bought this
other kind of cheese--
-  Are you scratching my back?
- No, back massaging.
- Oh thanks, what are you using?
Perfect, keep rubbing my back,
that's a good boy.
- But I got this other kind of cheese
that is made for, not made for,
but it's good fondue
cheese and I was like oh.
-  Expensive.
Yahoo, it's gonna be a good dinner.
- I'm excited, it's gonna be fun.
We've got dessert, we've got dinner
and we've got cheese.
-  Hi Pen.
- Sorry Penny, you're not invited.
-  And neither
are you, neither are you,
but you guys are excited
to have your sitter
come over, huh?
-  Yeah boy.
-  Oh my good grief.
-  Just stuff it all in there, bud.
-  Good grief.
-  Like a turkey on Thanksgiving.
-  No you don't eat anymore.
Let's get some food in ya.
- This is how we heat the fondue pot,
but it's all the way up there
and I don't want to climb up there.
So I'm gonna have you do it.
(Ellie laughs)
-  The duty that
all the kids have to do.
- This?
- Yep.
-  That thing, grab that thing.
Good job bud.
- Perfect.
- Thanks.
-  You know what,
Beau used to always put me
on top of the fridgerator at home
and I would just have to sit there
and I was too scared to jump down.
So I'd just sit there
for a minute, scream.
- My dad would have me
climb under his desk
and do all of his computer cords.
-  Oh.
- His legs went down
and then there was an underneath,
that part that I had to go under.
-  Yeah.
- So, I felt like I was Mission
Impossible all the time.
-  That's fun.
It's fun to help out.
Do you like to help Daddy out?
It kinda gives kids a little
something to do and satisfaction.
- Look at her.
-  Penny, doesn't she look dainty
with her little chewing thing?
Much better than Calvin's toy, huh Penny?
We have to take Calvin's
toys away from you
A few times a day.
(playful music)
Good luck getting it from her.
I don't think she is going to give up.
(Ellie laughs)
Once she has that,
there's no one getting it from her.
- Waa!
(laughing)
-  She'll tdrop the kids' toys,
but not her own.
- Not hers, no way.
-  No way.
- And that's something.
- Did you get it?
- Oh no, pull on it.
-  You had it.
-  Hey she was pretty good
to let you at least grab it.
Did you get it?
Did you get it?
You got it!
Awww.
Oh my goodness, Jackson got it.
Jackson!
Okay, throw it.
Oh well (laughs).
That was crazy.
- I want to do it again.
-  Well we'll see, I don't know.
Oh my word.
Throw it Cal, throw it.
How Calvin got it, I don't know.
Okay Penny, come here.
Throw it for Penny.
Woo!
Good girl.
Oh she just wants to go see Dad.
So you dropped it willingly.
He's putting stuff in the car.
She is always so concerned
if Jared goes out of the house.
She stops what she's doing
And she will stare at the door
until he comes back.
So she'll just sit here forever
until Jared comes back.
Do do do do do do do do.
Do do do do.
- Hi, did you miss me?
-  For two seconds.
- Ready ready sit, down.
Good girl, okay now soft,
so so so soft.
Soft, that wasn't soft enough.
That wasn't soft enough.
(Ellie laughs)
Soft, good girl.
That's a good girl.
-  Did your dogs ever grab softly?
- Oh Wrinkles did, Annie didn't.
- I'm trying to think of our dog.
I think I remember me giving her steak
and being nervous,
because she would grab a little too tight.
I am very happy with
Penny and her softness.
Now look, Penny's been hyper and playing,
so you have to hold it like this
and really remind her to be soft.
So say Penny come.
- Penny come.
-  Penny, do you want a treat?
Sit.
-  Sit, just one time say sit.
- Sit.
-  Now say soft, soft, soft.
-  Go very slowly and say soft.
-  Soft.
-  Soft.
-  Good job.
-  Gotta be so so so soft.
- Come.
Okay, soft.
- Soft.
- Soft.
Oh soft.
- Soft.
- Good girl.
-  I want to do it.
-  Do you want to do one more?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, last one.
Leave it there and she'll
grab it out of your hand.
-  Soft.
- Good.
- Yay!
- I'm going to go pick up the sitter
in just a minute.
So I grabbed the kids' clothes,
their bath clothes with
a little bath bomb.
I'm putting it in my bathroom
for them to get ready
for bed with the sitter.
I don't always do this
when we have babysitters,
but sometimes, depending
on how the kids are,
or depending on how the sitters are here,
what I want the babysitters to do,
I will just pre-make stuff for dinners,
so I made peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches
and I was like, they can eat that,
then they can have a snack,
apples, strawberries,
whatever, before bed,
so that is for the kids.
We're gonna say goodbye
to Penny for a little bit.
And I'm gonna go get her.
- Okay.
-  You know it's
gonna be a good relaxing date
when you walk out of the
house with your slippers.
- Yeah baby.
-  Walking out of my
house into someone else's house.
- I tell ya, my wife, business up top,
party down below.
- I never get to go in
the gas station with you,
because I'm always with the kids.
- Yeah, you always have the kids.
We have a long drive ahead of us,
so we gotta fuel up the car,
we gotta fuel up our bodies.
No kids, wanna party?
- I've been drinking water all day,
so I'm gonna be really
good and not get a pop.
- Okay, I'm not.
Ellie I will not let you try and open this
without my help,
because your fingernails.
You've been working so hard to keep those
ship-shape.
- Thank you.
- I will not let you break a nail,
while I try and struggle.
I can't do it!
Here, you do it for me.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- I got it all.
(gentle guitar music)
-  It is clean,
thank you Beau Beau.
It looks amazing, thank you Emily.
This is so fun.
Well that's nice, I'm starving.
Hi baby, hi baby.
-  Hello.
-  Hi baby.
Why did you come to the
party looking like crap?
-  Did you poop on your--
-  I had a blow out.
-  Oh no, and we
told you to leave the kids.
I'm sorry.
- That seriously looks crappy.
-  I like her shirt.
-  Oh I pulled out the camera.
(laughing)
Everyone say vasectomy.
Two people in this room have
had a vasectomy, guess who?
(laughing)
Hey thank you guys for a
wonderful fondue party.
- Thanks.
- We're gonna go ahead and fon-go.
We're gonna fon-go.
- Okay.
-  Thanks for the fondue party.
Goodbye everyone.
We're leaving.
- Bye.
Bye, we had fon-fun.
- That doesn't even make sense.
(laughs)
- I'm just trying, that's bad.
- Fo-fun, fo-fun?
(laughing)
- We laughed so hard for so long.
I loved tonight.
I hope you guys have
had an awesome weekend.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
- I hope you have a fon-fun day.
- Fondue day, fondue weekend.
- Shoot, I tried.
