- And I just feel a little.
I'm just gonna show you how I feel.
I just feel--
-  Who's birthday is it today?
-  Bonnie!
- I kinda get sick at night,
like it really hits me
really bad at night.
She's probably gonna return it.
(laughs)
- What?
-  What?
- It's an inside joke.
You'll know what it is.
Well, today I got beat
up, eight vials of blood
and a flu shot.
(laughs)
Hold on.
Gonna make you sick.
Now, run.
(laughs)
Ready? Got your shoes on?
- Yep!
- Let's go!
K, got you dizzy.
Let's go.
I got a lot of blood work done today.
I got like eight vials of blood taken.
- Are you feeling a little dizzy?
- Actually, when she was
doing it, I was feeling like,
"Ugh, I'm ready for this to
be done," and a flu shot.
- Even if you're dizzy,
I'll always support you.
- Thanks.
- Support.
- I told Jared that I was
gonna film in Hobby Lobby,
and then I raced in
there, grabbed my stuff,
and raced out, and I was
like, "I totally didn't film".
I have a little mini haul for you guys,
but, first, today is the
day that we put our video up
for the birth announcement,
and I'm sure Jared's gonna
wanna talk about it later,
and our nerves have been
very on edge the last few weeks,
and I'm just I feel really good today.
I got so much blood work done today,
and things are looking
good, and I'm feeling sick
which is awesome, and I'm just grateful
for everyone's positive feedback,
but you guys know, for
church, I am in charge
of activity days, and that
is for different age groups,
but my age group is nine year olds.
All the nine year old girls,
they come twice a month,
and, for my activity day
tomorrow, activity day.
Am I saying that annoyingly?
The activity for tomorrow
for activity days (laughs)
we went to Lowe's, and we had
a bunch of wood blocks cut.
This was an example I got at Hobby Lobby,
and then I had a bunch cut.
We're gonna be making countdown
markers for Christmas.
They have a flat thing that this goes on
and then two little markers,
and they will decorate them
with holiday paper.
I wanna show you some holiday
paper that we are gonna cut,
and they are going to glue on there,
and they're gonna make little countdowns,
and I couldn't find
any countdown stickers,
and the ones that I found were expensive.
I ended up getting the ink ones,
so if they can just put this in ink
and then put it on their
block for the countdown
for Christmas, and then I also am going to
print out the nativity.
It's like a mini nativity
book, and we'll color it,
and we'll go over the nativity, you know,
what Christmas means, so we'll kinda get
a little fun activity and
serious, but it's all fun.
I'm excited to do that tomorrow.
I get kinda anxious and
antsy when it's my turn.
I switch off with my partner,
but we do that every month,
and I get so anxious when it comes up,
because it's like I'm kinda of having
to entertain nine year olds.
I wanna do an activity
that's fun for them,
and not every month is like a fun craft,
like some is just like more of a lesson,
and some's a craft.
I get a little anxious,
but, now that it's here, I'm excited.
It's tomorrow night, and I've
talked about this before,
but I don't know if I've ever said,
because there's a lot of
you guys all over the world
that watches: it's for
anyone that's welcome.
You don't have to be, you
know, in the church to go.
If you contact a local
LDS church, they can get
in contact with the activity leaders,
and then you can get in.
You can let them know
that your kids wanna go,
and they'll invite them, and they can go,
and it's just really fun.
That's what I'm doing.
I told Jared that I'd film,
and then I left the camera,
so I wanted to show you
guys what I was up to,
but it's Bonnie's birthday,
and we're gonna go over
for some cupcakes, and
I got her a little gift.
I hope she loves it, and
I just feel a little.
I'm just gonna show you how I feel.
I just feel, I feel excited. (laughs)
I feel like my emotions are up and down,
and it's crazy, and
this is really exciting,
but it's so nerve wracking,
and I feel like every time
I say excited, I have
to say nerve wracking,
'cause that's exactly how I feel.
It's like the moment I get excited,
then I have to sit back
and be like I don't know.
It's just, it's crazy.
I'm in such a stage in life
where I have my young kids,
and we're trying to grow our family,
and, at least, how Jared and
I have always wanted to do it,
we haven't wanted to have, like, two kids
and then have like a
10-year, seven-year break.
We've just kinda wanted to have our kids
and then be done.
We feel like that time is right,
and I don't know.
It's just we're in a fun and
weird stage of life right now
where we have our young
kids, and we're trying
to grow our family, and it's
been an emotional few months,
but I'm glad that we
are here where we're at,
and I'm really grateful
for a really strong baby,
and I've heard so many good
news the last few days.
A lot of my friends, especially
my old salon friends,
a few of them have had a few miscarriages,
and I've recently talked to
them, and they are expecting,
and I'm so happy for them,
but there's also so much sad news,.
I don't know if they
want me to talk about it.
I don't wanna draw attention,
but just, one of my friends,
she's going through a process,
and things aren't looking well right now,
and it's just making
me really sad for her,
so just so many ups and
downs, and I'm so grateful
for everybody's support, and
I'm also grateful for cupcakes.
Let's go to Bonnie's and
eat a cupcake. (laughs)
-  Whose birthday is it today?
-  Bonnie!
-  And what do
you have right there?
- Her present.
-  Should we go give it to her?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's
go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Jackson, come give me a hug.
-  Look at him staying
on the dry part of the cement.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Link.
(laughs)
- What?
(crosstalk)
-  There he goes.
- I told Calvin.
I said, "You be nice to Lincoln".
They kinda have a love/hate relationship.
-  Yes, as all little boys do.
-  Hi.
(crosstalk)
-  Hello, how are you?
Hi.
Look at you, Ms. Stylin'.
- Thanks.
-  Yeah.
- How are you guys?
-  Hi, Link.
(shouting)
(laughs)
- Raspberry frosting, lemon cake.
Happy birthday to me.
(laughs)
Thank you, Bon.
- Happy birthday to me.
- No, happy birthday to me.
- No, happy birthday to me.
(laughs)
-  Happy birthday, Bonnie.
- Thank you.
-  Om nom nom nom nom.
- Really good.
- This is really good.
Bonnie, you need to go on
Cupcake Wars. (mumbling)
- Jared said that five minutes ago.
It was funny then.
Don't laugh.
(mumbling)
Here's your present.
I have to tell you.
I was looking online for over an hour--
-  Really?
- And I still couldn't
find the one I wanted,
and Jared says she's
probably gonna return it.
(laughs)
- What?
-  What?
- It's an inside joke.
You'll know what it is.
-  Okay.
- But I'm sure you'll
love it, but just to know
I looked for a long time
and still couldn't find
the one I really wanted.
- Okay, I'm sure it's great.
-  Uh uh, Calvin, uh uh.
- Is it flammable?
- I have no idea, but I like the package.
Oh my gosh, why on
Earth would I return it?
-  'Cause you return any jewelry.
(laughs)
- I usually do.
-  I'm saying that in a loving way.
(laughs)
- Oh thanks, Joel.
Let's see what I'm dealing with.
No, that's so cute.
I absolutely love it.
-  Mom, can I see it?
- I wanted to get the
pull one, and I looked,
and I could not find it anywhere.
- Well, I looked, and I couldn't
find it anywhere either.
I love it, Ellie and Jared.
Thank you.
-  You're welcome. Happy birthday.
-  I love it.
-  I haven't got
a close look of it yet.
That looks so fun.
- And I found BaubleBar from
Ellie, and I love their stuff.
Ellie, I love it.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
It'll be cute.
We have, like, a few gold necklaces,
but that's a little different.
It's kinda fun.
(laughs)
- I'll protect you, young one.
- Says the one that just
scratched Lincoln's face.
We just had to tell him to be really soft.
-  Well, we had to
tell them both to be soft--
-  I know.
- But that's just what boys do.
- This age is hard with kids,
because they're playing,
but, most of the time, they're fighting.
- Everything everybody's
playing with looks
more exciting than what
they're playing with, so--
-  They want
what everyone else has.
- You look like you're
having more fun than I am.
I want that.
-  Give me!
-  I really like
that hat you're wearing.
(laughs)
No, I want it back.
- No, that's mine.
- No, I want both hats. I want both hats.
- You can't have both
hats. You have one head.
(laughs)
-  I can hear
you, but I can't see you.
- Can we take a bow after
that weird performance?
That was a--
- Performance?
-  He's like, "That was real".
- Those were real emotions?
- I really like your hat.
- I want your Ogden, your Ogden hat.
Go ahead.
- I told you I'd buy you one.
-  It's cool.
- I told you I'd buy you one.
-  Are you guys gonna say goodbye?
Cal, can you say goodbye to Lincoln?
- Bye, Calvin.
There's the T-rex.
-  He's long gone.
Oh!
Did Jackson just push him?
I missed it.
- No, they ran into each other.
-  K, well, that's the goodbye.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
-  Happy birthday to Bonnie.
Say goodbye.
Say goodbye, Cal, to Link.
-  Hey, hey.
- Thank you.
(laughs)
Owie, owie.
I made them give each other a hug,
because sometimes they fight.
Bye.
-  Be good, boys.
(laughs)
- I need to hear you say it.
I need to hear you say it one more time.
- I think I've said this.
Do you see why I hate crafts?
Do you see me craft?
In the four years we have
filmed, do you see me craft much?
-  No.
- No.
-  Which is so strange.
- Because I hate it.
- We have a craft room.
-  No, we don't.
- That's pretty much what it's called.
- I liked what you said
that once to your mom.
She's like, "What".
-  You have a craft room?
- She even knew Ellie don't
know how to craft, girl.
-  Ellie is being
stinkin' cute, because she has
this project for church
that she's working on.
- Ellie don't love it.
-  And she's making these blocks.
- I do love it.
The thing is, okay, the
thing is is I can totally see
how people really like this
and how it's fun for them.
I feel like I just get too
flustered in the little things,
which I shouldn't, and I
could make it more fun.
Like, now that I'm getting
into it, I'm enjoying it,
and it's like, "This is fun and crafty"--
-  Good.
- But I feel like, in the
moment, I get overwhelmed.
It's like measurements?
Like, I just. (grunts)
Some things I like better than others.
-  Yeah, and that's okay.
Ellie, you are allowed to have
your own hobbies and interests.
Do you know that?
- Totes.
Yeah, I would totally like
rather like clean my toenails
and give myself a pedicure.
-  Right.
- Like, your mom is good at it.
She just thinks of things,
and she just does it.
-  Yeah, my mom, it's
pretty amazing what she can do.
- But it's probably because
she's been doing it for years.
-  Probably longer
than you've even been alive.
- Probably, but I used
to love making jewelry.
Bonnie and Julie, Bonnie
and I, we would get beads,
beautiful like Schwarzkopf beads
and real sterling silver
wire, and we would make beads,
like nice jewelry, and it was so fun,
but it's 'cause I just knew how to do it,
and, when you know how to
do something, you have fun.
If I got into crafts more
and I knew what I was doing
half the time, it would
probably be more fun.
- What you're trying to tell me is that
something that's new is hard
and, therefore, not fun?
- Totally.
-  So, like life.
- When Jared's old
friend that's my friend,
Jared's little girlfriend
that turned into my really good friend--
-  We talked about
this on our relationship Q&A.
- She's actually moving to
Utah, and we text a lot,
and I'm like, "When are you moving,"
'cause she's really fun
and artsy, and I'm like,
me and her getting together,
we'll have so much fun.
-  Doing crafts.
- Yeah, 'cause she'll teach me.
As I was putting Calvin to bed, I said,
"I can't lay with you".
I kinda get sick at night,
like it really hits me
really bad at night,
and I had to get this project done
for activity days, and I laid Calvin down
and I laid with him, and I
said, "I need you to stay".
Whatever; of course he's not going to,
and he stayed at his door
and just kinda whined
at his door, and then
I was like, "Come here.
"Lay on the couch. Lay down while I work,"
and he just was so good
to just lay on the couch,
and I just kept saying, "Close
your eyes, close your eyes,"
and he fell asleep, cute baby boy,
but I finished the project,
and I have to say, as much as
I was like, "I hate crafts,"
I really enjoyed it.
I did.
It was nice sitting next to
the fire, eating some chips,
cutting paper, like gluing.
It was just fun.
As much as I say I didn't like it,
it actually turned out to be really nice,
and I think it turned out stinkin' cute.
There are the blocks.
Look how cute that is.
I think the girls are really
gonna love doing this.
I had fun.
It took me a heck of a lot
longer to do than I thought,
but it'll go faster, I
think, with the girls,
'cause I kinda know what I'm doing now.
That is what I've been up to tonight.
Thank you guys so much for
all of your well wishes.
Thank you guys so much for your stories.
Jared and I are so excited.
I still think it's
hilarious what Jackson said.
We need a Hulk baby.
We need a really strong baby like him.
I'm gonna go ahead and
transfer this kiddo,
clean up my mess, and
then I am going to bed.
See you guys tomorrow. Bye.
(gentle music)
Are we both putting our kids to bed?
- I'm wrestling mine to get her to go.
-  Hey, mine went to
bed much better than this.
(laughs)
