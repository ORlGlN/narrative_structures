- It's a snow day.
(bright music)
- It was like pulling teeth.
Good news, we're on our way
to the ultrasound right now.
- I'm a little nervous, getting ready
for our second ultrasound,
my 10 week ultrasound.
-  Where's the baby?
Yeah.
That's the baby.
(jingling bells)
-  Good morning.
- Good morning.
-  Jackson's waiting by the door,
because guys, look at the snow.
We are going to play in that today.
I told the kids as soon as mom eats,
we can go outside and play.
I gotta go in the garage and see
if we have like a snow sled.
-  The snow thrower.
- The snow thrower?
-  Uh-huh.
- You remember that from last year?
- Uh-huh.
- To be honest, I think Penny may have
got to it last year.
We may have to get a new one.
- Abra-caaaa
cabbage!
(Ellie laughs)
-  I don't know what they're doing,
but every time Jackson does that,
he pulls the funniest face.
- abraca
dabra!
- It's officially time.
It's time to hook up the
plow to the four-wheeler,
so we can pow the driveway!
I love having a plow,
because I can plow my driveway so fast,
instead of shoveling and breaking my back,
but I can also help other people
with their driveways.
That's the coolest part about it.
I can zoom through mine,
and help other people,
help the church, do all those things,
help the people who
are in our neighborhood
who are older, all of that.
I love it very much.
The coolest thing about this,
is how quick it is to set up.
There's literally three
things that I have to do.
The hardest part about this
is lifting this heavy son of a gun
all the way back from over there,
over here.
It's like 200 pounds, I don't know,
it's probably not that much,
I'm just exaggerating
maybe just a little bit,
but it's heavy, brought it over,
hooked it up to the winch,
now I've just got to
attach it to the frame
and we're set to go.
That easy.
Let's plow.
Alright, let's see if I can do this.
(metal clanking)
So this side is in between the two slots,
but that side is not,
it's hitting the edge,
so I've got to figure
out how to figure to bend
it a little bit, to get it both inside.
This might be more
difficult than I thought.
I cut my finger,
not as bad as I thought it was though.
-  Hi Jare.
-  Hi.
- Looking good.
It's a snow day.
(bright jingly music)
- I see.
(laughing)
(Ellie laughs)
- Yay.
(laughing)
-  Is that fun.
-  No I'm gonna do it again.
-  Okay, I'll do it again.
Your caboose fell off.
Your rider fell off.
Hey, I don't think he's gonna tip you.
(Ellie laughs)
You took off without him.
- No.
(howling)
-  Did you guys have fun?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  You mister are the
one that broke the party up
and wanted to come inside.
Were you cold?
- Yeah.
-  A little.
So we got some hot chocolate going on.
- It was like pulling teeth,
it was so difficult.
So what happened,
I finally got it, by the way,
the plow is on, ready to rock and roll.
We're ready to plow some snow,
but here's what happened.
I couldn't get both parts into the mount
on the underside of the four-wheeler
because Joel and I reinforced it.
We vlogged about it a
long time ago last year.
We welded the pieces so
they would be reinforced,
and that actually pulled
one of the bars like that.
So it wouldn't fit inside of it,
so I literally had to jerry-rig it
to get back to position.
And I finally got it.
Now it's back in place,
here's the sad part.
My battery's died.
(laughs)
I am such an idiot guys.
I literally left the battery on,
it wasn't running,
but the battery was on from last night.
(sighs)
So luckily, I have this guy right here.
This has saved me twice before
when my battery has died.
And so we're getting it
going through right now.
And it is just charging up the battery.
This is a portable battery
and I keep it in my bag wherever we go,
because we've had
four-wheelers die on us before.
It sucks to have your four-wheeler die
when you're out in the middle of nowhere,
because then you have to tow someone
the whole way back.
But when you have the battery,
you're all set to go.
- I'm kind of to the
point in my kids' sizing,
that I just don't care anymore.
I just put pants on Calvin
and I was like oh those are Jackson's,
mm, we'll just leave 'em on.
They fit enough.
Yeah and sometimes you wear his.
And it's like so close in sizing
it really doesn't even matter.
But we've gotta get
their socks and shoes on,
so we can go.
You okay?
You got a little cough.
Uh-uh, excuse me.
- Uh-uh, boo tail.
- Bad news and good news.
Bad news is I couldn't get
the four-wheeler to start.
I'm trickle charging it right now.
Good news, we're on our way
to the ultrasound right now.
Our next ultrasound.
-  Just getting
a show on for the boys.
- Story.
- To entertain you.
I'm a little nervous,
getting ready for our second ultrasound,
my 10 week ultrasound.
Our ultrasound looked
really good at seven weeks,
but we're still really,
I think that feeling just
won't leave for a minute, but--
-  I don't think
it'll ever leave us.
- But I am excited.
I'm excited to see my doctor,
because we didn't see him
at the seven week, so,
and he's always nice.
- Oh my gosh.
- Do you see that?
-  Oh my gosh (laughs).
That's crazy.
-  It's like bumpin'.
-  A good sight.
- It's the baby.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, the baby.
- Aw that's cute.
- Listen, guys listen.
(heartbeat)
-  That's cute.
-  Oh my heck.
-  He's moving now.
That's a good rhythm.
-  Did you hear that boys?
-  What is is?
-  That's the baby's heartbeat.
-  161 beats a
minute, so that's good.
-  That's so
cute, that it is jumping.
-  I know, do you
see him jumping, her, him?
-  That's cute.
-  Okay, let's get a measurement.
-  Okay.
-  So if you extrapolate that,
if the baby's already two days ahead,
then it'll be like 17 pounds
when he's born.
(laughing)
-  Good luck with that Ellie.
Good luck with that.
- That's a mean thing to say.
-  No, that's the whole works.
-  That's such a cute image.
- Oh my gosh.
- There's your little legs.
-  Is that that
little hand up there?
-  Yep.
-  That's the cutest thing.
- So this right, is his head.
- Head.
- Look at his feet.
-  Hand, arm, leg.
- Oh my goodness, Ellie.
- Oh my gosh.
- But it looks great,
because we're looking not only,
all the baby's anatomy looks good.
That looks great.
-  The heartbeat was really,
I didn't like the heartbeat.
-  It sounds a
little different, huh?
- Oh my goodness.
- That's so cute.
(laughing)
-  Calvin baby.
-  Where's that
stuff I always take?
-  Where's the baby?
Yeah, that's the baby.
- Oh my gosh!
- Turn the car on, let's go.
(clapping)
- Ellie.
- It was so wiggly.
- It's our baby!
- Oh did you see it jumping?
- Yes, it like had the hiccups.
- I know.
We saw our baby today and the heartbeat
and everything.
- And
- his little hand was waving.
So cute.
- Or her.
- Well it's easier to say
his, right, than his or her.
- I know exactly what you mean.
- I'll just call him him until we know.
- Until we know for sure
it's our baby girl,
- It's just easy.
- Holy cow.
- It's a baby girl?
- We don't know yet.
We're gonna find out soon though.
- Oh my goodness.
- That that oh my.
- I am
I am, I can, I'm very happy.
- Oh my gosh.
- I don't know what to say.
- Just seeing
- It's such a relief.
- the shape of the baby,
the heartbeat, it's moving.
It was almost like
it was extra active
for us to see
- I know.
and just to make us feel
good and calm our nerves.
- Before even the heartbeat, it's like,
oh, the baby's moving.
And so are you guys.
- And the camera's fallin'.
- The baby was wiggling
before even the heartbeat,
which was so cute.
- Dad, when we get home. can I throw some,
can I get the snow thrower
and throw some snow balls please?
-  Absolutely you can.
- Yes!
(laughing)
- After Mommy gets some food.
- Yes we gotta get some food.
- He's like how are you doing,
are you keeping food down,
I'm like, oh yeah, plenty, eating lots.
I told Jared I swear when I saw
the baby move, I could feel it.
I know I couldn't,
- I don't want to order.
but in a way I felt it.
- I don't want to order.
- It was the weirdest thing seeing
-  I don't want
to go in the drive-through.
- our baby is healthy and strong
and I am so excited.
Oh my gosh.
Is there another word to say
other than I'm excited all the time?
-  You're ecstatic?
- I'm just so happy.
-  This is stupendous?
- The kids are so cute.
Calvin, are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Hearing the kids be like, the baby.
It's so fun.
- Yes, finally.
(four-wheeler humming)
(Jared laughs)
It finally started.
I have been charging
this thing all day long
and I finally got it done.
I can finally plow the driveway.
I know, you're probably thinking,
Jared, you could've
done this by hand maybe,
I don't know, 10 hours ago?
I did some of it, so we
could get in and out.
It's the principal of the matter.
It's the principal, I
had to get it started,
so I could use the plow for
the first time this season.
I had to do it.
Okay, let's plow some snow.
You'd think with how much the kids played
in the snow today, that they would go down
for bed very easily.
Jackson actually did,
but Calvin on the other hand.
- Story of our life.
Calvin, I can't wait for
my bump to get bigger,
so he stops thinking that the baby
is in my boobs.
(Jared laughs)
He's like, I see baby.
All day, after the appointment,
he has been, I see baby.
And I say the baby's in my tummy,
it has to grow a long time.
Oh Okay, I see Mama baby.
So cute.
- That's so cute.
- He's been so cute.
- Both of the boys have been very sweet
about this whole thing.
- Yeah.
It's been so cute.
So now that the appointment has done,
how are you feeling?
- I feel so good.
That was such a good feeling.
That was such a good feeling.
And my doctor makes me feel so good.
I was like, I don't know why,
so usually you only get two ultrasounds
to see the baby,
and that's because of insurance reasons,
and I was like, I'm happy
to pay for ultrasounds.
I don't think I can not
come and see the baby.
And he was just like, you know,
he goes, we'll work around it.
And I said no, I'm happy to pay for it.
And he goes okay, we'll
just let the nurses know
to make sure to have
the machine in the room
and we can do that.
And I'm like, you are so good to me.
Just so nice,
- I know.
- and never makes me feel bad or dumb
or anything like, he's just--
-  Considerate.
- It helps to have a really nice doctor.
- Yeah, and my first thought was like
well how much was an ultrasound machine
to have in our house?
I know Bryan and Missy
had the heart monitor.
-  Yeah.
- Maybe we should get
one of those sometime.
I think it would be fun to do that,
I don't know.
- Yeah.
-  Do you remember when we did it
at Bryan and Missy's house.
- That was fun.
-  Yeah.
- I love love love love
that today went well.
We were very nervous
and I think that it was just
a very good reaffirming,
like okay now I am 10 weeks
and things really do look good.
The baby was huge.
- Yeah.
Well it was so funny,
he's like well if things
keep progressing the way they are,
this baby's gonna be 17 pounds.
- I was like no.
-  No!
- Yeah the baby grew so much,
it's crazy how fast just in a few weeks.
And in a few more weeks,
how the baby will look.
I saw his feet, and his hands.
- I know, we saw our baby.
-  It was so fun.
- How magical is that?
How cool is that?
And, not only that,
I got my four-wheeler started today.
- Yay.
(laughing)
Our morning was a little cranky.
He didn't like that it
wouldn't work for him.
- Oh it was tough, I mean I spent hours.
And I have so much stuff do to,
(sighs) but I'm tired.
- Crap happens.
(laugh-crying)
- Yeah, but it was just a wonderful day.
Like I can't think of a better way--
- My hand's on my stomach,
'cause I don't feel well.
- Aww.
I can't think of a better way
to have that solidification,
that reassuring phew thing
going to that appointment today.
It was so nice.
But we're gonna call it a night.
We wanna let you know that
merch is still available.
Our holiday merch is still available

you will get it before Christmas,
so check it out.
