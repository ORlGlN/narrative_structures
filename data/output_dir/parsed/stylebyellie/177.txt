(upbeat music)
-  What Jackson?
-  Come here.
-  You didn't tell
us you were an artist.
-  Come here.
Did you draw this at preschool?
And it says your family.
Tell me who your family is.
-  Yeah, who's in your family?
-  You and mommy and Calvin
and Boston and Cody.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Did you draw their faces?
-  Uh huh.
-  That looks so good.
-  And mouths, nose, eyes.
-  Jackson.
-  That looks so good.
Is that Calvin's hair?
-  Yup.
-  Yeah.
-  I forgot to draw this hair.
-  That's okay.
-  Oh that's okay.
-  Jackson, aw that makes me smile.
That is so tender.
That is Cody and Boston.
-  He is, they're
our family, Cody and Boston.
-  And, do you
know what letter this is?
-  "T."
-  Is that a "T?"
What about b-b?
-  Bug.
-  "B?"
-  B-b- "B."
-  Did you trace all the "b's?"
-  Looks good,
uppercase and lowercase.
-  This made my day.
-  This is so cute.
Oh yeah.
-  I love you.
-  I love you too.
-  Hey, give me a kiss.
Love you.
- I love this.
Where is my, I gotta
take a picture of this.
(light guitar music)
(laughing)
-  You sure know
how to move that finger.
(laughing)
-  Hello.
I am a romper, and I am so scary I'm cute.
See?
The sign says it so it must be true.
Rawr.
I'm looking for someone named Calvin.
I want to put him inside of my clothing.
Is that weird?
Did I take it a little too far?
Yes you did, you took it a little too far.
This pocket is for candy only.
Get out of town.
Get out of town.
Jackson, Calvin this is just for you.
- This is coming for you Jacks.
-  Fidget spinner Lush bar?
Does it smell good?
- Happiness all in one.
-  There you go.
- Let it be know, Jared just
tried to order a baked potato.
Mama Mecham did you just hear that?
Jared Mecham just tried
to order a baked potato.
- Willingly, willingly.
On my own accord I made
that decision, but I didn't.
-  You're grown up.
- They didn't have them.
-  Oh.
- I can't do...
-  Potato fries.
- I can't do mashed yet.
Baked, yes.
Fries, of course right?
Duh.
Sweet potato.
Are those a little healthier?
I don't know, maybe.
I feel like I should have
explained why this is significant.
If you guys know me at all,
or are a part of my family,
I've hated potatoes my entire life.
Of course I've been able to
eat fries because they're
fried potatoes and you
don't taste the potato.
Steak fries, jo jo's, those are
a little bit more difficult.
But, my entire life I just
haven't like potatoes.
But, ever since I went to
Finland, and that's like
a huge staple in Finland
is eating potatoes,
I grew to like them.
But it really, what it
comes down to is like,
I like potatoes with my ranch.
- Totally, totally.
- Isn't that so bad?
That is really really bad.
But I'm actually, it's growing on me.
It's just something that has taken
29 years of my life to grow on me.
So, after this I guess tomatoes is next.
Ew.
What just happened?
Oh my gosh tell me.
- Calvin just pooped in the toilet.
-  No.
- Jackson and Calvin are
both proud little boys.
(laughing)
- I swear this happened with Jackson too.
- Damn.
- How do we miss this?
-  Both boys.
-  Jackson pooped
at Bonnie's house.
-  For the first time.
-  For the first time, and now
the way it sounds, you'd
make it think it's us but
it's not I promise you we try and do this.
- We are good parents.
Calvin is the cutest thing.
-  Oh, it's so sweet.
-  The last two weeks,
every time Jackson goes
to the potty Calvin wants
to get on, which is great
cause it took a long time for Jackson
to warm up to even getting on the potty.
He flushed it away very fast.
-  Oh how cute.
- I said take a picture.
-  Oh no.
(laughing)
- Only a mom would want
this in this situation.
- And we've been trying to
get him to go on the potty,
like just warming him up to
it, and today he must've gone.
- Aww, how sweet.
That is the cutest thing ever.
Calvin, that is so cute.
But it's true, like, every
time Jackson goes potty
Calvin's like "I wanna go, I wanna go."
And he'll take off his pants and he'll
take off his diaper and
he'll want to climb up.
So we help him do it and it's just like
getting those motions in.
-  Yup.
- And it just finally
now he actually did it.
Cause he sits on the toilet all the time.
- So proud of him!
-  I know.
- I've had a wonderful date today.
Jared just took me out
and we have shopped,
we've played, we've cried.
I've loved it, loved it.
- Yup.
We're actually down here in Salt Lake
because we have a meeting for CVX Live.
Oh no, that's not for a while though.
But, we're talking about
next years CVX Live
and everything going forward.
Is it locked?
That's weird.
Here, I've got an idea.
Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.
-  You're welcome.
-  You have to bite it in half.
-  You are so lucky.
- Did you have fun with her?
I miss you.
-  I can't believe
we ran into you guys.
- Oh, fancy seeing you here.
-  I know.
- We must be sisters or something.
-  Sisters.
And Carl and Ginger, have we vlogged that
we're with Carl and Ginger yet?
We met up with Carl and Ginger too cause
we've got important business to discuss.
- We're so businessy today.
-  Yeah, we're
wearing our business attire.
- This is my "I'm getting crap done."
- We're adulting now.
- Yes, initiate adulting mode.
Now you're probably wondering why
I've gathered you all here to...
I'm sorry.
What's up everyone?
How's it going?
Look at this crew that we've got
here around the dinner table.
What's up guys, how's it going?
We're having hamburgers
and hotdogs and I think
the coolest thing about this
is they have JDawg Sauce.
If you've never had the pleasure
of having a JDawg hotdog,
you don't know what the special
sauce is and it's amazing.
- Let's eat.
- So we're all sitting on this couch.
This is a U shaped couch
and we're all sittin' here.
And then we've got John
and Brett over here.
I feel like we're in trouble
at school and these guys are
gonna give us a scolding
or something like that.
Oh family of-
My heart is not pounding.
- Either getting invited or
not getting invited to CVX.
(laughing)
-  Are you freaking kidding me?
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, the car's moving.
It's moving on its own.
-  I'm summoning the car.
-  What?
-  With an app.
-  Let's see
how smart it really is.
(laughing)
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Move it, it's
not that smart watch out.
-  It's not that smart watch out!
-  Don't, don't.
-  Oh, it is that smart!
-  It's stopping.
-  It's stopping.
-  It stopped, it really did.
-  It is that smart.
Oh my gosh.
Dude, Dan.
Freaking Dan.
We're playing with his Tesla right now.
Oh my gosh.
Ellie, you're gonna let Ellie drive it?
-  Walk up to the front door.
-  Let's watch this in action.
-  Don't touch the door though.
Just walk up to it.
-  Oh, mother!
-  Let me open it for you.
- Do I not weigh enough?
-  Alright.
(laughing)
It should've recognized the key.
Okay so go ahead and hop in.
-  Hop in and put
your foot on the break.
-  Jared should be sitting in here.
(yelling)
This is cool.
-  Hold on.
First, let's adjust it.
You're small, let's do Kenzie she's small.
-  This is the break.
-  Okay put your foot on the break.
-  It does it by itself dude.
This is incredible.
Oh my gosh, Ellie.
You're driving this Tesla.
Carl, hop in man.
-  What?
Where's Ginger?
Why did she leave?
-  So you could do a, they
could do a bench see Ellie?
- Look, the key is like a car!
-  It is a little car.
-  Let's go fight crime.
-  Watch out for the speed bumps.
They're kinda crazy but you
gotta give it, you gotta
punch it and give it a shot.
-  Okay well wait till there's
not a car in front of us.
Oh falcon wing doors, holy crap.
Ellie, okay so seriously.
There's, it's really, really fast,
so watch out for the truck
in front of us please.
-  Is he being serious?
Well it's not fast unless I drive it fast.
 Yeah, you have to punch it but
just like, just be careful.
-  I don't want to punch it.
I'm just gonna drive how I want.
-  Okay.
- It's not driving by itself.
-  Not yet.
Well you're in "park."
(laughing)
-  There you go, now you're...
-  Okay, drive.
Now if I let go, its
not gonna punch itself.
-  I don't, you
can drive it normal, yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  Good luck.
(yelling)
(laughing)
-  That's smooth.
-  That is smooth as butter.
Holy crap.
-  Oh my gosh, my heart.
I'm sweating.
I didn't go way fast but I punched it
and you don't even hear it rev.
-  Yeah.
Isn't that the craziest thing?
There's no engine.
Well there is an engine
but it's not a gas engine.
-  Like it feels really good.
-  It's kinda unnerving that...
-  Jared I feel
bad I'm driving it because
this is like what you want.
-  No, this is totally fine.
Cause I'm gonna drive it after.
(laughing)
- This is beautiful.
-  Do you like it?
- I love it.
This is very beautiful.
This is smooth.
I can't believe he's
letting me drive his car.
Does he know I failed Driver's Ed?
This is beautiful!
Okay, you drive it now.
-  Okay.
Oh my gosh I'm kind of nervous.
Are you guys ready?
(yelling)
-  Oh my gosh, wow.
-  Wasn't that crazy?
- It was so cool.
- I only got up to like 45.
-  No way.
- Oh my gosh.
-  Only 45 it feels like your like...
- This is so spacious.
-  Oh my
goodness this is so awesome.
Hey Jared, are you getting one?
- I freaking want one.
Ready?
- Yeah.
(squealing)
-  It feels like you're on like...
- A rollercoaster?
-  A rollercoaster
when it's about to go up.
-  It
does feel like that.
That's how smooth it is.
And there's no sound.
- These seats are so cushy.
- 
And there's no exhaust.
You could like, run this
in your garage and not die.
- There's a camping
mode that you can do so
you can like sleep in it
and let it keep it on.
-  Oh my goodness.
That's so cool.
-  Okay, which one
did you like better?
-  Thanks Dan.
-  You're welcome.
(laughing)
All you need for good hugs
from Jared is a brand new car.
- I really like the seats
on the Model X versus the S.
-  The white interior is beautiful.
You can get the white interior in the S,
which, it's possible but
we didn't have another one.
-  I mean the falcon,
like everything is just
so crazy cool about it dude.
- Look at this.
Did you see even in the back?
There's drink holders back there and
there's USB ports to charge
if you look in the front.
-  Oh my gosh.
What do you call it?
The "frunk?"
Can you show me the frunk?
- Who has the key?
-  Ellie do you have the key?
I think it's in there.
Ellie, there's a frunk.
Do you want to see the frunk?
- Yeah.
-  I just like saying frunk.
(yelling)
-  This is called a frunk.
This is a frunk.
- Ellie, get in the frunk.
-  There's room for
one in the back and the front.
Get it in now.
This is a pretty rare
occasion that Ellie and I,
we are actually just gonna stay the night
here in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Just for the evening because
it is actually really late.
It's midnight.
And then we're gonna hang out with
Carl and Ginger for a little bit.
But we walked into our hotel
room, I've gotta show you this.
-  I like it.
-  Ellie loves it and I feel like
it looks and definitely
smells like a grandma's room.
That's my first thought.
I was like, I feel like
this is grandma's room.
- Well, it's an older place but I love it.
-  Yeah, it's actually
a pretty nice hotel so.
Okay, ready for bed?
-  I didn't bring pajamas.
-  Do you wanna wear my pajamas?
Okay.
No, Ellie, we went to the store and
got pajama pants for me.
You could wear the shorts
and I can wear pajama pants.
We win!
- Alright guys, this is the
pants that I am wearing.
These are Jared's.
Don't I look sassy?
-  I think you look sassy and sexy.
- And Jared, you, I don't know
if I'm more attracted to you
cause you just, I just
loved on him all week.
You just have been so good to me.
But look at those pants.
Look at those joggers.
We got him new pajama pants.
You are a turd, stand normal.
Stand normal!
(laughing)
You look very cute.
Love them.
Come on Peter Pan.
- I can't believe like I had one of my
biggest dreams come true today.
We drove a Tesla and, in
fact, Ellie you did it first.
- And, it was wonderful Jared.
-  It was wonderful.
And you know what else was wonderful?
Hanging out with you Ginger and Carl.
-  Oh, thanks.
-  Yeah.
- Me and Jared have already
built two Teslas on the website.
-  We did.
- We're doing a little dream shopping.
- I just looked at Instagram.
- It is 1:20 in the
morning so we have to call
it a night so we can get this
video up to your eyeballs.
So thank you guys so much for watching.
Have a wonderful evening and
we will see you tomorrow.
Bye!
That's my bum.
