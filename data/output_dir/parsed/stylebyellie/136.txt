- Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Let's get into this.
- We've never done a Q and A like this.
- No, it's going to be right.
It's going to be honest.
It's going to be different, deep.
It's all about
relationships, and marriage.
There's so much that we can go into.
- And there's so much
that we're still learning.
- We gotta get some
things on the table first.
- No one's perfect, so I think that,
that's just a disclaimer,
like we're not doing this,
because it's like we
have a great marriage.
We're going to talk to you about advice.
We're doing this because a lot
of people ask us questions,
and this would be a good
opportunity for Jared and I
to share some things that work,
and maybe talk about a few things
that we get flustered with.
- Absolutely.
There are gonna be some
things that we're not good at,
some things that you're great at,
some things that you could
learn some things from.
You know, everything has to
be taken with a grain of salt.
It may not work for you,
it may not work for us,
and vice versa.
So, I went through 1,400 questions.
(Ellie squeals)
I went through all of them,
and a lot of them had
some very similar themes.
So I took those questions,
and we're gonna be trying
to go through some of those things,
but they all blend together.
So this is gonna be more
of like a conversation,
while we're answering some questions too.
Should we get to it?
- Yes.
- Just so we're clear, I think this
is kind of more like a podcast feel,
and so this might be a longer video.
So, grab a snack and a
video, let's go for a ride.
- Go to the bathroom real quick.
- I feel like we should kiss beforehand,
because this is a relationship
video, so maybe...
- We actually just did, now he
wants to do it for you guys.
- I just like to kiss you (lips smack).
First question, "If you could
give one piece of advice
"to a newlywed couple, what would it be?"
I have advice that I give all the time.
Do you have anything that you would--
- I'll let you go first.
- It's advice that I
have been given before,
and I've kind of carried it with me.
It's that selflessness is
the key to a happy marriage,
and it's a two-way street.
If you and your partner are both selfless,
thinking of each other
first, then the happiness
that you're giving, is also the happiness
that you're receiving.
- 'Cause you're both giving.
- Yeah, exactly.
But, if one person stops being selfless,
then it's broken, so it's hard,
but once you have that, it works.
- That's a natural.
It's natural to be like, "Oh, I need help.
"I need help doing this."
Kind of be a little selfish one day,
and so it's always good to go back.
That's why you always have sit downs,
that's why you talk.
Maybe that's why you pray.
I love that advice.
- I think serving your spouse
is one of the best ways
that you can show affection and love,
and that's something I have to work on.
Would you agree?
- We are continually,
every day, every day,
and we'll do that for
the rest of our lives,
until we die, we will.
I would say my piece of
advice for a newlywed person,
and I'm telling myself this.
If I were to go back eight
years, and give myself advice,
I would say, before we got married,
to detail talk about finances and sex.
That's what I wish we
would have done more.
We did talk about that, not a lot,
but I wish we would have even more.
- I totally agree, because--
- What you expect,
how do you do your finances?
Are you okay having credit cards?
You know, that kind of
stuff, just everything.
- We found that a lot of
arguments in marriages
come down to finances and intimacy.
Being on the same page with those things--
- Expectations, everything.
- Can solve a lot of arguments.
"Did you have any serious
relationships before each other?"
For me, I would say I have.
- We're like (squeals).
- I definitely didn't have as serious.
I dated, but none of the
people that I were dating,
I was considering marriage.
- The month before Jared
and I really, really,
knew we liked each other, we
actually texted quite a bit.
- It was November, right?
- That month Jared and
I had stopped calling,
stopped texting.
It wasn't like we were upset of anything,
we just did it.
I was still in school, and so I just knew,
he's just like doing his
thing, I'm doing mine.
Jared actually took that month off.
I didn't know this until we had talked
after we officially hooked up,
but Jared took that month
off because he thought,
I really like Ellie.
I need to go a path, tell my friend Ron,
and I want to make sure
that there is no feelings
or relationship with this other person.
So he took that month off to try and see
if there was anything
there with that person.
- Yeah, I needed to make
sure that the feelings
that I had for Ellie were...
- Real.
- Wasn't the direct
focus, my main intention,
and they were.
- I'm so glad you did that.
That was good.
What were we talking about?
- Serious relationships before.
- Serious relationships,
I dated a few people
that I felt like I really liked,
but as far as a serious relationship,
like possible marriage, I
would say there was one,
where he was...
This is hard, 'cause I was in high school,
so sounds so crazy, but it was.
When you say that, it
sounds kind of weird to me,
but at the time it didn't--
- It wasn't weird.
I would say I had a serious
relationship before Jared.
- "What are your favorite
budget night ideas,
"or your favorite date night in,
"when you don't have a babysitter?"
- We do a lot of date night ins.
Well I guess I don't know.
I don't feel like we get
babysitters the whole ton.
If we get 'em, it's actually
usually for lunch dates.
I really enjoy doing
that, more so than dinner,
because we like putting the kids to bed.
- Obviously, we like watching
our shows and everything,
but when I think of a date night,
and I kind of think the whole family.
Making a blanket for, and watching a movie
is my favorite thing to do with the kids.
- Even though Jared and I do this often,
it really is a date to us.
We always get a drink, and a snack,
and we take a bath together.
That really is a time that we just sit,
we talk about whatever we want,
and we often try not to
talk about work or kids.
It's like we're just
talking about us in the tub,
and how we're feeling,
and what's going on.
It's like at date.
- It is like a date, 'cause it's intimate,
it's alone time, and you're
focusing on each other.
I think that's kind of
the whole point of that,
is to converse, and to have
a check in with your spouse.
That's always something that
we enjoy is conversations.
"Did the infertility issues
ever put a damper or stress
"on your relationship, or did
it only make you stronger?"
- That could go either (laughs).
- You tooted, it's okay.
Real quick, to answer the question,
who's the sneaky one in the relationship?
It's her.
(Ellie and Jared laugh)
- Well everyone already knows us.
- That's common knowledge.
- That question could definitely
go a few different directions.
I would say it definitely made
our relationship stronger.
It definitely put a huge,
huge toll and stress
on our private intimate life.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Absolutely, just not
fun, forced, just (gags).
Infertility issues, medication, timing,
it's not fun.
- I think--
- Mentally, physically.
- I think one of things that it did do,
is it made us realize that
we both handle stressful
situations, and grieving, differently.
Sometimes that can be hard
for the other person to understand,
is that when you grieve,
or when you stress,
you handle those situations differently.
- Even with the miscarriages.
- Yeah, especially with that stuff,
'cause, I mean, that's the
hardest stuff, is the loss.
- We definitely handle thing differently.
- I feel like we are together,
stronger, because of it.
- Oh, totally.
Our relationship is stronger,
but there's a whole other side.
There's your relationship,
and there's your intimacy,
and it totally can affect both of those.
I mean it made some things difficult,
but I don't know if it ever
put a huge damper on things.
I mean, this was a problem
that we had to go through.
- It did tear us apart.
- Yeah, but I mean there
was definitely like,
"This sucks, let's do this together."
- I've read several forums
on the infertility pages,
and a lot of women are on
there that are having the issue
that it's like, "My husband
just doesn't even get it."
Like me and you luckily didn't have that,
so there is so many different
paths that can go down.
- "How do you guys have time
to be romantic with two kids?"
Why don't you take this one.
- What, I feel like
I've been talking a lot.
- I've been talking a lot too.
(Ellie laughs)
You start and I'll--
- "How do you have time to
be romantic with two kids?"
Kids watch a movie and have some popcorn.
Don't bother us for 20 minutes.
That we do a lot.
- That's one way for sure.
Honestly, I feel like with our kids
at the age that they are,
it's relatively easy.
I mean, the kids bedtime is
between seven and eight p.m.,
which is kind of like prime time for us,
so it's easy right now.
I imagine when the kids get older,
it's gonna be more difficult.
- To have our alone time.
- Yeah, but also they're
going to be doing more things.
- "Have you guys ever been in a argument,
"and couldn't resolve the
issue over a couple of days,
"and what what the hardest
decision you guys have ever made
"while being married?"
As far as arguments over a couple of days,
Jared and I, we really
think it's important
that, that is so toxic,
and bad, to be angry,
especially for multiple days.
- Especially, just even over night.
- Not everybody is like this.
Not both spouses are more open
to just talking it out,
and that's okay, if that is
now how you handle stress,
or how you handle the relationship,
you do what's best for you.
The one night we were upset,
and I went and slept on the couch,
it was the only night
we've ever done that.
20 minutes later Jared came
out with a pillow and blanket,
and laid on the floor, and he said,
"I didn't marry you to
not sleep with you."
We just talked our argument out.
I don't even remember what it was,
and went back to bed together.
Ever since then, we've never slept apart.
We really, really feel it's
important that we don't
be angry for multiple
days, because I love you.
I need you.
- We're a team.
- I get angry, and sometimes we argue,
and sometimes the argument
lasts a half a day,
or almost a full day, where it's like,
we are just so annoyed,
I can't even look at you.
It's like, we have those but we definitely
do not go to bed angry.
I know it just has happened that way.
It's worked out that way.
- It's something I can't have.
I personally, it's like--
- You don't like contention.
- Well I don't.
I don't like things dragging on.
I like to resolve situations quickly,
and almost to a fault sometimes,
it's just like, "Okay, whatever."
- To stretch on this topic,
because you said that,
Jared does like to
resolve issues right away.
That has actually made us
sometimes argue a little bit more.
- Like I said, to a fault sometimes.
- Maybe to inform you a little
bit more like situations
is Jared does want to
resolve right then and there.
There are times when I am so on fire,
and it's like, okay I need
to sit in my own bubble
for just one second, and I
need to calm myself down,
before I'm able to even talk it out.
There's been a few
times when Jared's like,
"No, let's talk about it."
I'm like, "No, no, no."
- Ellie's like, "I need space!"
- Oh totally.
I'm like, "No, give me five minutes.
"I just need five minutes."
Just so I don't say anything stupid.
Just so I don't do anything stupid.
Just so I can just kind of think of--
- Process.
- Yeah, process stuff.
So even though we do resolve things fast,
there are times where it's like
I flippin need a break though
for just a minute (laughs).
- And that's totally, totally true.
Every person will handle
a situation differently,
but I think, and we kind
of talked about this
today at lunch.
I feel like a lot of
arguments that are had,
are because of almost like egos,
and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone.
This is just something that I feel.
- I will point a finger (chuckles).
- I don't know, but I
feel like both people
want to be right, and that
is the cause of the argument.
- Most of 'em.
- Yeah, but a lot of
the times the argument
is so irrelevant to the situation,
that the argument is
more about who is right,
rather than solving the issue, compromise.
- Totally.
- I mean, some of our arguments have been
over the dumbest things.
- that we can't even
remember, 'cause it's dumb.
- The reason for the
argument we can't remember,
but we remember the argument itself.
A lot of times it just doesn't matter.
It's just like check
your egos at the door,
and remember that you're a team,
and remember that you're working together.
Remember that you have
to move forward together.
I feel like if we do that,
that itself helps solve
a lot of arguments.
- Jared is, and I give him this fully.
He has helped me, is Jared is amazing
at taking himself out of the picture
and looking at everybody's perspective.
He does this in every situation,
and there's been a few
times where I'm like,
"You don't need to be doing that.
"Why are you helping them?
"They've been so mean to you."
- Think about mean, think about you.
- Yeah, and there have
been times where I'm like,
"Excuse me, I'm right here."
He really is good to be like, "Well look,"
and he talks about their situation,
how they could be feeling,
me and my situation, him.
He is so good to look at everyone right.
I am not that way at all, and
I'm slowly becoming better,
but I'm not that way.
- Well that's why we make a good team.
- We do, we make a good team.
Jared is really good to look
at everybody's scenario,
and I feel like that could
help a lot of family,
friendships, just be like,
okay, there is conflict,
but look at their side too.
Even if they're wrong, look
at their side for a second,
and just see where maybe
they could be coming from.
- Why and where they're
coming from, exactly.
- Why are you good?
I'm not good (laughs).
- There we go.
- He really is, and I give Jared--
- Thank you.
- I give Jared 30 high fives.
- Well, I want to give you one kiss.
"Tell us more about your date with Julie."
Okay, so we say we went on
a date, it really wasn't.
- It was a date.
- It was a date, but it wasn't like
I'm gonna ask Julie on a
date, and I'm gonna take her--
- Yes, it was a planned date.
- Landon and Julie were
going to a concert,
and he didn't realize that
he had family pictures.
He had just gotten off his
church mission after two years,
so he went to go do family pictures,
and he was like,
"Well we're gonna be
hanging out afterwards.
"Anyway, why don't you and
Julie go to this concert."
Which was like on college
campus, it was in the afternoon.
Julie and I went to this
concert, and we just had fun.
It was Ryan Shupe and the Rubberband.
- So, it wasn't like a date,
but it was like they hung out.
- But, I will say, we did hold hands.
- To be cute.
- Just to say, we're like,
"Wouldn't it be funny if..."
Just like as a joke to Landon.
That's it.
- It was fun.
- It was fun.
- Fun and games.
- Julie and I were born in the same year,
so we graduated in the same year.
"Do you truly think there's
someone out there for everyone?"
I think that there's not
one person for someone.
I feel like you could be married
to a lot of different people,
but we just probably don't meet them
and develop relationships with them.
Do you know what I mean?
- Are you reading my mind?
I remember my dad telling me this,
so I don't know if I think this
because I've heard it a
few times from my dad,
or if it's 'cause I think it.
I believe I believe it as well,
but I remember my dad saying,
"You can love everyone.
"You can choose to love someone."
So I don't feel like there
is your soulmate out there.
I feel like if someone
is willing to love you,
and you're willing to love
them, that you can make it work.
Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah, I think so.
I definitely think that
there's compatibility.
You're more compatible with a few people
than you are with a lot of people.
So while it may not be like,
oh you could marry anyone in the world.
No, it's like maybe you have
this group of compatibility,
but I don't think you have one soulmate,
and if you don't find that one
soulmate you're in trouble.
That's what I mean.
- I agree, so Amen (laughs).
- I think Ellie's pretty great.
- But I do believe you
can choose to love people.
- Absolutely.
- Even not in deep love, but
even like grocery stores,
or out an about, you can
choose to like people.
You can choose to be nice.
You can choose to love someone.
- It's a fun game to try and
find something that you like
about a complete stranger
without going up to them,
without knowing them.
Find one thing that
you like about someone.
I challenge you right now, like (mumbles).
What do you love about me?
Tell me.
Name three things you like about me.
- I like your blue eyes.
- Thanks.
- I like how nice you are to people.
I like that you rub my back at night.
- "What is the main core of
having a healthy marriage?"
- This is so hard.
- I mean, four cores and
seven years ago, no I--
- "What is the main core of
having a healthy marriage?"
- I think there's so many
different things to it,
but if I were to think
of like in Jared's book,
what goes into a good healthy marriage?
- We're basing this on us.
- Yeah, and we're not perfect.
- Not advice to people.
So this more like, this
is what's healthy for us.
- In our marriage what do
you think has been the best?
Communication?
We're doing a good job of
communicating right now.
- We don't know what it is.
I feel like with Jared and I,
the reason things go as smooth
as they have been is because our main core
has been we believe the
same things with God.
- Our morals are in line.
- I feel like it just comes down to
we believe there's a God,
and if we hold tight to him
and each other, things will work out.
- Absolutely.
- I feel like that's what's
helped me and you the most.
- Religion is a huge part of
our life and our marriage.
We haven't dove into
that a ton, but you know,
a lot of people know what we believe,
and it is part of it.
We believe that families
are together forever,
and that's a huge part about our family,
siblings, and the extended family,
and us, and our family with our kids.
Those moral values are a huge part to us.
- That is why we are who we are.
- Absolutely.
- It's in our blood in a way.
It's like, it's just a way of life for us.
- I think wanting to be
better people for our spouse,
like I want to be a better person for you
is another thing too.
I want to constantly improve myself,
so our marriage is better
is another thing, you know.
- Yes, I love that, and
I think that's very true.
You do that.
- You do, you boo.
- Oh, Aspen over, "Do you
like to touch Ellie's butt?"
Well if see in our Amazon video,
I couldn't get enough of it,
so I think yes--
- Jared touches my butt a lot, actually.
If we're just around the house,
he's always like, "Hey," and pats my butt.
- Good game, good game.
That's you know, physical
touch in a relationship
I think is important.
I think when we talked
about love languages,
that's my love language is physical touch.
That was third for you.
- Act of service.
- Yeah, and physical
touch was third for you.
- I like my back to be rubbed.
- So I like to touch Ellie's butt,
and Ellie likes me to touch her back.
(Ellie laughs)
Thanks for the question Aspen.
- "How do you make it a priority
"to devote time to your marriage,
"rather than just as parents?
"This is a hard struggle in my household.
"We seem to forget we're
married, not just parents."
- Having a set date night
is one of the best ways
that you can do that.
We don't do a good job
of that, but we want to.
We always want to.
Whether it's an elaborate date night
with you and your spouse, a double date,
or even just like we mentioned earlier,
bath time with a snack and a drink,
that's a great time to do that.
That's simple and quick,
but it's very effective
in terms of cultivating and
developing your relationship
as a couple.
- Totally.
This is a really hard, hard question.
This is something that Jared and I
probably struggle the most with,
is our time with parent,
and work, and then us.
Especially with us, it's all in one.
In our home, we work in
home, we parent in the home,
and then it's like us together.
It's like we see each
other during the day,
but it's not always
like really, good solid
one-on-one.
- It's business.
In the daytime, we're all about business.
- That's very hard for Jared and I,
and it is something that we struggle with,
and that we're trying.
There's often times where we
just have to tell each other,
or one of us has to say, we're done.
- It's usually Ellie that says that.
- It's nine o'clock, and
I can't any more today.
My brain is done, my emotions
are swept from all day
taking care of the kids, cleaning.
I need you to just sit with me,
and that is something that we
are really trying to work on,
especially probably the last six months.
We've had two miscarriages.
That's something that
Jared and I are definitely
trying to work on, and it's like,
we always talk about
before we had kids,
it's like every flippin
day was a date night.
He got home from work,
and then we didn't have
to think about anything.
Now it's like we have kids to put to bed.
We have like--
- And a video to edit.
- Yeah, we have other
priorities even after work.
It is something that it's an every day.
Some days, and that's beautiful
too about what we do though,
it's like some days it's all work one day,
but then the next, it is all like...
- Family.
- Yeah, family, so there's pros and cons
to everybody's situations,
but I think that,
that's really important
for husbands and wives
to say no, and to have one-on-one time.
- And date each other.
- Totally, and we're learning.
We're still learning.
- It'll be eight years,
and that's the thing.
You always have to be
educating, and improving,
and working hard at it.
It's not some that you
just master an you're done.
It's something that you're
always constantly working on.
- Do you feel like now
that you've been married,
and even when we first
got married that you were
a little like, oh, it's not like that.
I remember being a little
girl, looking at may parents,
and thinking once you're
married, you're set.
I used to think that, because
I looked at my parents,
and my parents never fought.
I remember my parents
having disagreements.
Never were they yelling,
never did my dad hit my mom.
It was just, oh that's
life, they're happy.
When I got married, it
was like what the...
- What's wrong with Jared?
- You know it, but my parents
did have those issues.
They handled them in different
ways than some other people.
- It's just a constant
evolution, because life changes,
situation changes.
- And you grow.
- And that means your
relationship changes.
- I was 18, and now I'm coming up on 27.
It's like I myself have changed, you know.
- Yeah, absolutely, and that's
why we are doing this too,
because we learn from doing
these Q and As just as much
as someone might be able
to take a snip it from it.
- It's good to talk it out.
- I have to fart.
- (laughs) See I'm not
the only stinky one.
(Jared farts loudly)
(Ellie squeals)
- You better keep that in.
- No way.
- You keep mine all the time.
You will keep that in.
- We'll see.
- He does that.
Sometimes he makes me look bad.
I'm like, Jared.
- "How do you share your feelings
"and struggles with each other?
"Do you ever feel scared to
talk about how you feel?"
- Yes.
- I feel like I used to,
but I feel like I've gotten
a lot better at it.
When we first got married, I was scared,
and almost embarrassed
to talk about finances.
- I didn't think he was, and
this is why I went back to,
I wish I would have
detail talk about things
before we got married.
I remember being married two months,
and I was looking at the
account for something,
and I kept seeing transactions.
I'm like, we should
probably have a food budget.
There was a lot of Taco Bell
going on for both of us,
so I remember you were in that pink chair,
and I was like, "Hey Jared,
I think we should..."
and I had a book written
out of some things.
We should figure out
how much is our income,
let's figure out our budget.
- Like any couple should do,
if you don't have a budget,
you should do it.
- I'd never seen Jared
react this way ever,
in our relationship,
and then the two months
of being married.
I seriously was like, "What the heck?"
- I just put up a wall.
- "Who are you?"
- I put up a wall, and I
didn't want to talk about it.
- And I was mad.
He just was like, he's like, "No."
I'm like, "What?"
- Part of the reason I
won't go into it too deep,
but like--
- It was personal.
- It was personal, and
my parents didn't talk
about finances with the kids,
and so I didn't talk about
finances with really anyone else,
and so that's just kinda
how it just translated over.
As soon as we did, and as soon as we were
on the same page with it,
oh my gosh the weight that it
lifted from our shoulders--
- That helped.
- Was amazing.
I mean there were definitely
times that we were scared
to talk about feelings, but I feel like,
just like our relationship has developed,
so has the ability to share
and experience those feelings.
- I remember something that helped us
get into financial thing,
and whether you agree with
everything he says or not,
it's good to listen to, because
some of it is common sense,
is Dave Ramsey, and not
just read his book, listen.
- Listen.
- Because Jared laughed so much.
He would come home from school,
and they would be playing,
and he would be laughing,
because he's funny.
- Yeah, and motivational.
He makes you want to do good.
- So that helped us a lot.
It was like listening to
finance stuff together.
- Well this is a great way
to Segway into this topic
a little bit deeper.
The next question says,
"I noticed in some of your earlier videos,
"you mentioned budgeting.
"What does your budget look like?
"I feel like money is
one of the hardest things
"to combat in a marriage,
and just wondering
"how you recommend tackling it?"
Well like I mentioned before,
we use the Dave Ramsey envelope system.
Essentially what we do,
is we spend our money,
on paper, on purpose, before
the month even happens.
- So we think what are we gonna make?
What we actually make.
What is our expenses?
What's left over, where can we put that?
Could it be in a car fund,
a house fund, savings?
- Retirement.
- School loan, if you
have one, type of stuff.
- Finances can be a touchy subject,
but I feel like when you
have that information,
you have power.
If you're kind of just going
by the seat of your pants.
- It gets spent.
If you don't plan it, it gets spent.
Even if you're not a spender,
somehow it's like, where did it go?
I feel like it's really important
that not one persons does it.
There's a lot of people that,
that's how it works for them,
and if you're okay with that,
by all means do that.
- Do what works for you.
- I feel like that's almost
like intimacy, finances,
those are two huge parts of marriages,
and I feel like you need
to be on the same page.
Intimacy, you really, really
should be on the same page
with finances too, and know
where things are going,
and feel comfortable spending the money.
I mean, I know we talk
about Dave Ramsey a lot,
but it's kind of just common sense.
- It really is.
He says it's like the
grandmother's way of finances,
and it's true, but it works.
There's so many different
ways that you can go about it,
but it's just simple and
everyone can understand it.
I mean, I guess just for the sake,
we'll have his website linked
in the description down below,
for information.
He has a radio show, you know.
- It's always fun to listen to.
- Yeah, just check it out.
It's not gonna hurt you to listen.
It won't.
- I really like this one,
especially for Jared and I,
because we really did
get married so young.
"Did you ever feel rushed to get married?
"I'm 23, and my boyfriend and
I have dated for seven years.
"I love it, would also
love to get married,
"but I'm in now rush to do so.
"We talk about marriage all the time,
"and know it will happen eventually.
"How did you know when
the right time was?"
I really want to answer this,
because we were really young.
I remember going into JC Penney's,
and I was trying on a dress.
It was like four, something
to do with the wedding.
This was the first time
that somebody in public,
a stranger, was like, "What?"
She was like, "How old are you?"
I mean, I still look like I'm 15,
and I was kind of, I
walked out of the store
feeling really weird,
because she was like,
"You're getting married,
you have your whole life."
I just thought, "But I know what I want,
"and I found it, and I want it,
"and I don't want to let it go."
I, not for a second felt
rushed with my parents,
didn't feel rushed with religion.
That's the thing, whatever
decision you make,
that's your decision, and
even if you do feel rushed
by someone, at the end of the day,
you made that decision to get married.
I don't know if you could
say you were rushed,
because you made that decision.
I didn't feel rushed whatsoever.
- Neither did I.
I mean this was the decision that we made,
and we took the time that we
wanted for our engagement,
for our wedding, and everything.
There was no rushing there.
It felt right, and I feel like--
- And is was smooth.
There was arguments, but
there wasn't many arguments.
It wasn't like...
- It wasn't the type of arguments
that would make or break a relationship.
- It wasn't like red flags everywhere.
It was like we grew,
and I think the reason
why it went so smooth, is
because we both grew up
almost the same way.
We both thought the same things,
and that really helped us.
- The thing about other people saying,
well don't you want to live life,
and experience it.
- There was pros and cons.
- There are, but at the
same time it was like,
well I want to experience
that with my wife.
I want to experience that with my family.
My wife is my best friend.
Why not go on these
adventures with my wife,
and my best friend?
- I look at it two ways.
If we were to have waited or whatever,
and I got married right now at my age,
I would be a completely different
newlywed wife, completely.
That could be a big pro.
I really enjoyed that we got married
when we were in college,
because we learned to struggle together.
We learned to get by with
very, very little money.
We learned together, you know--
- We've gone through the
best and the worst, together.
- You still will go through
bad times and good times,
even if you get married later in life.
There's no right or wrong.
- This isn't like I say,
"You need to get married young."
No, you need to get married when you feel
it's right for you and your partner.
- And there shouldn't be a rush.
"As a wife and mother, to
legitimately wanting to know
"how to keep the love alive.
"I just like your advice.
"Sorry if my original post offended you."
- No, we didn't delete--
- I didn't delete it, I promise you.
"How do you keep the spice alive?"
Let's really think about that one.
♫ How do you keep the love alive
To me, it's being goofy,
and I feel like the vlogs don't
really capture that a lot,
because sometimes it's
like, "She's a freak."
- Well, it's also because
it's so spontaneous.
It's like, wait let me get
the camera, start over.
It's just like you just roll with it.
- I think to me, keeping it spunky, spicy,
it is totally being goofy.
Like funny things,
just like being in the
shower and just being dumb.
- Wait, do you laugh in the shower?
- This is gonna go the wrong way.
This is gonna go the wrong way.
- I know what you're trying to say.
When you're laughing together,
you're enjoying each other's company,
you're just having a good time together.
You're being goofy together.
- And not being so serious.
I think sexual jokes are really funny.
They're hilarious.
They always make me laugh,
and I always say stuff
that's really funny,
and sometimes borderline,
like you probably
shouldn't have said that,
and that makes us laugh,
and it lightens the mood.
If your humor is not that way,
maybe don't go that route.
To me if I can make a sexual
joke, and make them laugh,
that makes my day.
- Then it's spicy for sure.
(Ellie laughs)
Again, I think it goes
back to the communication,
the dating your spouse, all
of the things that we've
talked back before, apply
that to your relationship,
and see what works for
you and your spouse.
"How important do you
think physical contact,
"hugs, cuddling is to a relationship?
"Obviously emotional
connection is more important,
"but should you go out of
your way to give your partner
"that physical affection?"
I think this goes to the love languages.
There's this love language book.
I mean, it's not like--
- I do think that's important.
That would have been fun to
do before we got married.
- I think you should do it.
I don't think it's like...
- Crucial.
- Yeah, it's not imperative,
but it would be eye opening.
For some people as far as
learning about their spouse,
and even learning about yourself.
I like physical touch, and
not even just like sexual,
but I like to cuddle, I like
to hold hands, I like to hug.
- If we have an argument, the
first thing Jared does is,
"Oh Ellie."
- I just want to hug.
- And the first thing I
do, if like I do is like--
- Give me space!
- Yeah the first thing I say is, "Not yet,
"let's talk this out."
I'm a little mad, I don't
want to hug when I'm mad.
I want to hug you when I'm happy,
so that's usually how it goes down.
- I feel like physical
touch in the right times
and the right places.
- Right places, don't grab
her boobs in public (laughs).
- Not that in the right places,
I mean like in the right times,
and not physical places
but you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I get what you're putting down.
- What is that?
Freudian slip, I don't know
if that's a Freudian slip,
but I think it's important to identify
what kind of love
language your partner has
to give that to them, instead
of just physical touch,
if that makes sense.
- I do think it's important.
It's sad that at the end of the day,
we're outside, did we
even look at each other
in the eye?
That is a big deal.
Even just looking at
each other and talking,
'cause how often are the kids around,
and we're talking to the
kids, and we're talking.
We've had a good day,
but did we even really,
look at each other, because
sometimes you say things
to your spouse, and it's
like that's your spouse
you're talking to.
Sometimes I don't look
at you as just a spouse,
yeah we're living
together, you're my friend,
and I'm just gonna say it.
Sometimes we could be better at,
you have your feelings and emotions,
and we could be better at talking nicer.
You get in the habit of saying,
oh go grab me that.
Well, no, please.
You know, so I think it's really important
to just look at each other in the eye--
- And think of the
other person's emotions,
like you said.
It's great to take yourself out of that.
- I have a lot of fault in that.
- It's great to take yourself
out of the situation,
and observe it from both sides.
There's this comedian,
and he has this joke.
I'm not sure if it's
appropriate or anything,
but I feel like in my
head, the analogy works.
He says, "I don't understand
spouses getting so mad
"at each other that they
do things to each other.
"It's not right."
He's like, "That's like
keying your own car.
"You would not key your own car.
"That's your spouse, that's your car.
"You would not do that thing."
It is kind of true, it's just
like you have to remember
that's my wife, or that's my husband.
That's my best friend.
Why would I do those things to hurt you?
- Sometimes you hurt the
ones you love the most.
- Yeah, that's deep.
- You do, not always
sometimes, like you usually do.
Sometimes you say things, and it's like,
"Why did you do that?"
- That's why it's also good--
- I think it is important to
have the physical contact.
- Forgiveness is another thing
that I think is really
important, that a lot of people
don't fully take into considerations.
It's like we all make
mistakes, we're human.
- Every day, for the rest of our lives,
we're going to be working on this.
- We need to remember that
when we go about these things.
I mean there's a line to certain things,
but I'm talking in general.
We make mistakes, and when
you can take these mistakes
that you're both making together,
and come to be better
people from those mistakes.
The trials that you go
through don't define you,
and the trials that you
overcome define you.
If you can overcome those
mistakes and those trials,
then you'll be better people for it,
and better relationships.
- I don't know if this is
even going to make sense,
you can cut it out if you want,
but I'm just thinking
with you saying that.
It's like, when you get
married, it's not perfect,
and it never is.
We do make mistakes.
In a way I'm relating that to church.
It's like, we don't go to
church because we're perfect.
We go to church because we're trying.
We go to church because
it helps me remember
why I'm going to church,
is to be better to people,
to be better to myself,
to be better to my spouse.
In a way I relate those
two, because it's like,
you make mistakes, and
that's what church is for.
I make mistakes, but that's
what our marriage is for.
Is I made a mistake and
I need to lean on you.
- That's another really good point
that I've talked a lot about in the vlogs,
but I haven't said here.
It's like, having a spouse is so wonderful
when you can depend on them
to lean on when you need it.
It's almost like a balance thing.
When I'm feeling up high,
and Ellie's not like,
I want to be there for her,
so I'm going to be the support
that she needs to bring her
back up, and vice versa.
- I think it's very important
to let the other person vent.
The other day Jared, Penny
had jumped on the desk.
She got milk everywhere.
It was a hot day mess.
- I have a lot of equipment in my office.
- It was a hot mess, and
Jared was really mad.
I walked in the office,
and I was like Jared.
'Cause in my head, it's
like we'll clean up.
It's okay.
He's like, "Ellie, I need to vent."
In that moment I thought
I'm gonna shut it up.
I let you be mad for a
minute, and it's like,
you should be.
- I cleaned up the mess,
and as soon as everything
was taken care of--
- He walked out of the
office, and was like,
"How are you?"
I'm like, "I'm good."
- That's exactly how it happened too.
- It was really funny.
I was like, "He's so damned bubbly."
I think that's another
thing that's important,
is don't be upset if your
other spouse is upset.
Let them vent, let them talk.
Sometimes it's not
always soft spoken angry.
Sometimes they are upset
and raising their voice.
Hear them out and then
you be the one to be calm
to talk about it, and
then hopefully next time,
when you're upset,
hopefully, they'll be calm
to talk it out.
- I feel like when--
- It's a learning...
- Yeah, when something that
Ellie and I have been doing,
and working hard at is when
we do have our arguments,
we take the time to calm
ourself, so we're talking
in this manner right here,
rather than yelling at each other.
That helps a ton.
If you're just talking to me
without raising your voice,
and I'm talking to you
without getting mad or angry--
- Things resolve easy.
That's hard to do with kids.
During the day, sometimes
that's really hard,
when it's like, you've got
two kids running around.
They are crying, they're whining,
someone just broke a dish.
The dog just jumped on the couch.
The dog just knocked Calvin over,
and it's like, "Knock it off!"
Sometimes it's just hard
to be that calm person,
and that's normal.
It's just life, and
sometimes you just need
to just take a big flippin breather.
- Honestly, that is a huge help.
It's funny, like on the Apple Watch,
they have that breathe app.
That helps me a ton,
to just whew (mumbles).
- I would say even in
the last three months,
with our miscarriages, and stuff,
I feel like it has made
me grow a little bit.
My sister's like, "It
changes who are within."
I'm like, "I believe I have changed.
"I have been giving myself my time."
In the mornings, and the
kids have been pretty good
to adapt to it.
I tell them, I say, "It's
mommy time right now.
"I'm just sitting.
"I'm not getting up, I'm going
to sit here for 30 minutes,
"and just sit."
Then sometimes they run
wild and break a dish,
and I just don't care for minute.
I just need to just be, you know.
I think that's important.
- Yeah, absolutely.
The thing with all of this is
some things are going to work
for some of you, and some things
are going to work for others.
This is just us essentially just talking,
having a conversation.
We're not professionals,
we're not perfect.
We make mistakes, and
these are just some things
that have worked for
us, and that we enjoy.
Hopefully that some piece here and there
can help some of you, and
that's why we wanted to do it.
- I feel like last but not least,
I guess it doesn't come that smoothly.
If you or your spouse, you're not wrong.
That's okay, and that's normal.
- It takes time.
- I talked about this
already in another video,
but I feel like counseling
is not a bad thing.
To have another person, or even a parent,
if you really love and trust your parents,
how many times have me
and you had conversations
with your parents.
It's like, we've been
fighting a lot lately.
We have that conversation
with your dad a year ago.
How many times have we
been talking to my parents.
We've talked about situations
and we've gotten their advice?
- Together, we have done that.
Not like one-on-one,
we've gone to our parents.
- And just asked questions,
like what do you do for this,
and then you realize like, "Oh,
my parents aren't perfect."
It's like, "Cause nobody is."
- They've gone through
those similar things.
- 'Cause no one is perfect.
I really enjoyed talking it out.
- Yeah, I did too.
I mean I enjoyed it because,
even just sitting here talking,
I've felt like we've learned and--
- Connected.
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna lie, like Jared and I,
we do pray together,
and we did say a prayer
before this video, to
help us feel at peace,
and talk openly, and I
really feel like that helped.
I like praying with Jared,
and I feel like that helps sometimes too.
Sometimes Jared says,
"You should say a prayer."
I'm like, "No.
"you say it."
(Jared and Ellie laugh)
He's laughing 'cause it's so true.
- Because it's true, yeah.
- It does help.
I truly feel like it does.
- Yeah, absolutely it does,
and that's just a part
of our relationship.
It really is, it's a
part of our relationship.
- I'm the Debbie Downer.
- It may not be everyone's
part, but it has helped us,
and we're grateful for it,
and we wouldn't have it
any other way.
This is a learning experience.
- Thanks for your questions.
- Yeah, thank you for your questions.
We're here to learn and grow
right along side with you,
so I hope you enjoyed.
I hope you got a smile,
whether it's Ellie farting, or me?
- You farted too, you better keep that in.
- Shoot.
- You have to.
- This video's getting too long as it is.
Thank you for the questions.
We'll do this again another time,
and maybe we'll podcast
it up or something.
Have a wonderful day.
Go hug your spouse, hug your kids,
and we'll see you guys next time.
Bye.
- One day at a time.
♫ Time after time.
