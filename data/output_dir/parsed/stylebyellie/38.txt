- I gave Calvin a choice.
- I'm planning a trip right now.
- Now I want you to be honest with me.
We have never used this before.
Good morning guys.
Well, I'm gonna be honest with ya,
it's not morning anymore.
It's well past the morning.
Hi Mom.
Guys, my family is not
feeling all that great.
- We almost made it too.
- Yes, we almost did.
Well here's the thing,
I still feel great and girl,
I look good too.
- No one's had colds, no one's
had flu's all winter long.
See ya.
- And then last night,
Jackson woke up and he just
did not sound good at all.
That was about four in the morning
and he slept with us
the rest of the night.
Poor guy was just wheezing,
it was just terrible
and then Calvin this morning,
was not near as bad,
but it's starting to be,
I feel like it's coming on
and of course we're out
in the middle of the day,
where we're up,
we're doing things, and so it's not as bad
as it was at night,
but I feel like the nighttime's
gonna get pretty bad.
So that means, we've kinda
just been hunkering down.
We have been down here in the basement
and we've watched a couple movies
cuddling on the couch as a family
just trying to get these
kids to feel better.
They've gotten some energy now.
-  Dad!
-  Oh my gosh.
Hey, who was that?
- It's me making cookies.
- Me.
- Can you hear Jackson's voice?
Can I have some cookies?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah Dad.
-  Hi.
- Cookies.
- Thank you, thank you
for making me cookies.
(gobbling)
It's a secret family
recipe, I can't tell you.
(gobbling)
So today's going to be one of those days
where we just hang out,
(yelling)
make cookies in the hello room
and try and remedy the situation.
- So usually once a
week I try and sit down
and work on our upcoming week
and our schedule,
my bullet journaling,
and I want to update you guys
how that's been going.
The first few weeks, this
is how the layout was,
the week across, the notes down below,
but I'm kinda changing
it up to look like this
and this, so I'm really trying to work
on my cursive right now.
I'm getting our weeks down and scheduled.
I went--
Penny, hey.
Jackson's been teasing Penny.
I don't want her thinking
she can grab your toy.
And you're kind of giving it to her okay?
Do not give her your toy, okay?
- But she's trying to get it
if I don't let her.
- Okay let's try not to
tease her with it, okay?
Penny, where's your toy?
Let's get your ball.
Come here Pen.
This is yours.
That is yours, okay.
(Ellie laughs)
Okay, are we good?
Do we have our own toys?
I want to schedule a little family trip
before the baby comes.
I have some few things on my calendar
that involves me and work and some fun
that I get to do,
but I want to take the
whole family, the kids
and including my Miss Penny,
Miss Pretty Penny, I want us
all to go on a little trip.
And Jared and I have talked lots
about maybe we could,
'cause I love the beach
and I love that the kids find seashells
that's just something that's so fun to me.
But we can't go too terribly far
and we really want to use our camper.
We want to use our camper,
so I'm planning a trip right now
and I don't know what days we're going
or when we're going,
so I'm just trying to really schedule out
pretty far in advance.
This is into March.
And just see what works for us
and what scheduling works for us.
Where did they?
Okay, I'm everywhere,
because I'm watching the kids and Penny.
Penny girl, Penny.
(laughs)
But I'm just excited.
I think that it's gonna be really fun
to be able to bring Penny
on a little trip with us.
I just think it sounds really fun
to do a little family getaway
with our Miss Pretty Penny.
- I feel like I've made a breakthrough
with this whole potty training stuff.
Calvin has been wearing
his potty training watch
and so far today,
he's gone to the bathroom
on every half hour
for the first, I don't
know, half of the day
and then every hour the
second half of the day so far.
And every time his watch has gone off,
he's gone to the bathroom
and it hasn't been a fight.
And I think the reason behind it is,
well I'm just an awesome dad.
That's reason number one.
No really, what I think it is,
is when I take Calvin to the potty,
what I first would do is I would have him
get up on the potty.
I would take his undies off
and then I would sit him on the potty,
I would do that.
But, like I mentioned, I
didn't take my own advice.
I gave Calvin a choice
and this is what the choices were.
I kinda am tricking him into his choices.
- I like that.
- I would say like--
(laughing)
- I like tricking my kids.
- That's kind of the parent's thing.
I say, do you want to take your undies off
or do you want me to take them off?
And he says, no I want to do it.
So then he does it.
- And he'll climb up.
- Yeah, do you want me
to lift you on the toilet
or do you want to get on the toilet?
No, I want to get on the toilet.
Okay and then he sits down on the toilet
and then he goes pee.
- Oh yay.
- We haven't had any
accidents today so far
and it's been great.
- He's doing good.
- It's been so good
and I feel like I am finally
getting the hang of this.
because honestly--
- I'm proud of you, it helps.
- With Jackson, you did it.
I mean I didn't really do the
potty training, Ellie did.
And so I feel like I'm
actually contributing
to this whole family situation.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Oh well you're welcome.
- It is helpful,
because I have been, I was
laid down half the morning.
- I feel about as good as I look,
which is subpar.
(laughing)
Well Ellie hasn't been feeling that great.
You know Jackson is kinda
like Groggy McGroggerson.
- But he seems happy as a clam right now.
- [Jared- Yeah, when our energy levels--
- He's so happy.
-  Are high.
-  He likes to,
you little booty dancer.
(Jackson laughs)
- Oh did you hear that,
kind of like uuuuhhh.
Anyway,
- yeah.
- But yeah, I thought
I'd give you some info
on my potty training breakthrough,
so the book will come out next week.
(bright music)
-  Let me help you do your name.
- The probe feature when set correctly
will signal an alert when
the internal food temperature
reaches the desired
set target temperature!
We have never used this before
in our oven.
We have a probe feature.
We're probing our food.
(laughs)
Gosh dangit, I'm the worst.
I am making Chicken Cordon Bleu for dinner
slash lunch slash linner, second lunch,
first dinner tonight.
And the thing about
chicken is it dries out
so dang fast, especially when you bake it.
And so Ellie was like, I was like,
should I go get an internal temperature,
an instant temperature reader?
She's like, Jared we
have a probe downstairs
that we've just never used before,
so I'm reading all the
instructions on how to do this.
It's cool enough that I
can see when it happens,
but when it gives me an
alert that it happens,
oh man that's just
technology at its finest,
the less I have to do, oh my gosh,
my technology senses are tingling.
Are you ready for this?
Piping hot 165 degrees
exactly, Chicken Cordon Bleu.
This is the first time
I've ever made this,
so I hope it is as delicious as it looks.
When I was in college, we had
the cafeteria freshman year
and they had Chicken Cordon Bleu there.
And it was just like
cafeteria Chicken Cordon Bleu,
but I loved it,
and they had it almost every single Sunday
and it was the best.
Everyone chowed down on the Cordon Bleu.
So I'm hoping this is like that.
Okay family, come up to the dinner table.
It is time to eat Daddy's
delectable delights.
Now I want you to be honest with me.
This was the first time I've
ever made Chicken Cordon Bleu.
How was it?
- It was--
-  Headache inducing?
- very good.
No (laughs).
It was very good.
-  Good.
- I really liked it.
I haven't eaten chicken in a long time.
-  Yeah.
- But it was very good.
- It was pretty good.
It wasn't like what I remember
as a freshman.
That stuff was like holy crap.
I don't know if it was
because I'm a freshman?
- Sometimes it's the--
it's like you were
starving college student.
-  Well yeah, I was a
poor starving college student.
- It did taste so good.
-  Yeah.
- The tuna sandwiches?
That's how we feel.
- Oh my gosh.
- Whoa.
- ahh.
- Poor college students,
nothing tasted better
than a tuna sandwich.
- I want a tuna fish sandwich right now.
Oh my gosh, that is a comfort food for me.
Tuna fish sandwiches
with potato chips, oh.
- With pickles in it,
you eat it.
- Yeah totally.
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
and Miracle Whip, Ellie.
None of that mayonnaise, Miracle Whip.
Are you guys Miracle
Whip or mayonnaise fans?
Let me know in the comments down below.
Jackson did you make your bed today?
Good job.
That's actually not bad at all.
I'm proud of you buddy,
thank you for doing that.
That's so sweet of you.
- No!
So it is time for us to get ready for bed
and we can read a story.
- Jo, this is Jo.
- Is that the Joker?
Should we read Batman and
the Joker story tonight?
I don't know, Batman and the Joker.
I think we'll read that story tonight.
It's been kind of a day to just recoup,
relax and try to get over this sickness,
so I think we're going to
call it a night Jackson.
- Dad remember we watch Lego Batman?
- Yeah, and now we're reading the Batman.
Yeah, oh careful, don't fall backwards,
that was close.
I had a dad save today at the table.
Calvin was falling off our barstool
and he fell off backwards
and I reached and grabbed
him and saved him.
It was pretty epic.
Hey guys, can you say
goodbye to our friends
and that we'll see them tomorrow?
- Goodbye Daddy friend.
(Jared laughs)
- Bye poop.
- Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you guys for watching.
I hope you have a wonderful week.
And I think if I'm right this upload's
Happy Valentine's Day.
We'll see you guys later, bye.
