- It's freezing.
- It's freezing, good
morning, happy do year.
Happy do year?
I was trying to say how are you
and happy new year at the same time.
Good morning guys!
It is a beautiful, cold day today,
and we're meeting up with my family
to have breakfast because Jenn
is going back home, something like that.
- I'm gonna find a good seat like that.
-  Like this up here?
-  Huh.
-  Calvin is that
your seat for the day?
You like it up there,
perched up in the corner?
- I wanna get in the corner.
-  (laughing) Sometimes
that's a good thing
and sometimes that's a bad thing.
(jingle bell music)
-  That's a C, try the C then.
-  Okay.
-  Now try a K.
Oh and the other line.
Oh okay, now the O.
Pretty good!
-  (laughing)
these two kids over here
have become besties, huh?
(laughing) oh he's like
oh the camera's on,
gotta get closer to Jackson,
prove our friendship, huh.
- Well we have a little good news.
Little good and little bad.
I took Calvin to the doctor 'cause he was
crying so bad last
night that his ear hurt.
He's getting his two
year old molars in still
and the doctor said he
had a little infection
and so he prescribed us some medicine but
he said to keep him just on some ibuprofen
for like a day to see if that will help
'cause there wasn't a ton of infection
but it was there.
But, guys, are we ready?
What are we gonna do now?
- We're cleaning up and going to the store
and get some gifts for
us, for Calvin and for me.
-  Yeah, we are going to work
and if you and Calvin do your jobs,
you guys get some money.
And then we'll go to the store and
you each will pick out
a gift for each other
for Christmas, okay?
Does that sound fun to pick out a gift?
- When is Christmas?
-  And then in a
few days we'll wrap it,
we'll put it under the tree, and then in
a few days you guys can open it!
- Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
-  Does that sound like a good idea?
- Yeah.
-  Okay you know what
chore I want you to do?
I want you to wipe up
all of the doorknobs,
so that they're nice and clean.
So I'll give you some--
- Where's the knobs?
-  The knobs.
You show me where doorknobs are,
show me where they are.
- Are these, is this it?
-  Yep, those are the doorknobs.
So I'm gonna give you a cloth and I'm
gonna have you wipe them up all up,
that's your job, okay?
- With water?
-  With a cloth,
like a sanitize wipe.
Okay go wipe the bathrooms now.
Now the other one.
Here's the cloth.
Okay look, can you see
all the dirty spots?
You wipe those really good.
- More.
- Yep, more.
Yeah and right here.
-  Yeah.
- That looks like a booger.
Right here.
Haha, it probably is.
I remember last year
the kids got each other
a little gift for each other to open up
and for some reason,
it wasn't that I didn't
want to do it this year
but I just thought oh,
I don't know, I don't
know what I was thinking.
And then my friend the
other day she was like,
oh my kids are so excited,
I had them do chores
to earn money, and we
got the house cleaned
and then we went and picked out a gift.
And I was like, I'm gonna totally do that!
So the kids are working and I'm helping
and we're just doing extra things like
all of this stuff, it's just so sticky
and the doorknobs.
So we're wiping up,
Jackson's wiping up some
doorknobs, sanitizing
them, making sure none of
us get sick, and the kids
will go pick out a gift
for each other and I'm
really excited for that.
It's crazy how fast stuff gets sticky.
This wasn't too bad, it's mostly the kids.
The kids drawer 'cause
they always open up that
to get all their plates and stuff out.
How are we doing down here Jacks?
- I'm still doing some knobs.
- Okay, you're doing all the knobs.
Calvin what are you doing?
The wall?
Okay (laughing)
You are doing so good.
I'm gonna let you finish making your bed
while I have Calvin do a chore, okay?
Kinda rushed out of the house today,
I didn't even do my own
chores which is my bed.
I need to make my bed.
As good as it's gonna get!
- You have to close your eyes.
-  Okay my eyes are closed.
- Don't open them.
-  Ugh! Couch.
Gotta tell me where to walk.
Ugh! The stairs!
You gotta tell me how to walk.
Is there a stair in front of me?
Okay tell me, say step.
- Step.
-  Oh, I'm nervous to fall.
- Step.
-  Oh, step, okay.
- Step.
-  Okay, good, you're
doing better at navigating me.
- Step, step.
(laughing)
Open them!
-  Oh, that looks pretty good.
Good job, that looks pretty dang good.
You got the zipper there, okay.
You got your toys under your pillow
like you always have before bed, huh,
you always put toys under your pillow.
Good job, mister!
- Yeah!
- Who wants to help me do the dishes?
-  Me, me!
- Okay come help.
Oh, and this one.
And this one.
Thank you, you are being a good helper.
That's what I do love about kids like
they wanna help, they want to help you
in the kitchen, they want to help stir
the pancake mix, they want to help you and
I think sometimes, life
is busy and parents
sometimes we just get
overwhelmed, we're like
no, no, no, we'll just do it, 'cause it's
easier and faster, but it's--
- What about these ones?
- What about those ones?
Those are put away.
What about your cups?
What about, you know where these go.
Why don't you go put all of these away.
-  Okay.
- Yup, go put all of those away.
And it's like if we can
just spend the extra time
and let them help us, it really does
so good for them.
They want to help, like I don't even care
if he helps me right now with dishes
but he wants to help.
Good job and we're trying
to earn some money.
A little faster.
- Super duper fast!
- Holy moly, you're in fast mode!
Holy moly, Jackson Clark!
Jackson Clark Wigham, he is so fast,
so he wants to buy his
brother a present so bad.
- It's almost finished!
- Good job, keep going fast, fast, fast!
Mister Jackson Clark Wigham is gonna go
full speeding fast everybody!
He is using his hands,
he is using his fingers,
he is moving so fast
because he wants to earn
every single dollar so
he can buy the coolest,
newest toy on the market!
I hope they advertise good for this.
This toy that he is gonna buy because it's
gonna last so long!
I don't even know if I'm making sense.
I always loved it when my brother Bo
had me for Christmas
because he always got me
the coolest gifts, and I
still have a lot of the
gifts that he got me.
- We're at the store right now, Jackson,
and what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna pick, find a gift for Calvin.
- Yeah, so let's go through
all of the aisles and
we'll pick a gift that you
wanna get Calvin, okay?
- Okay.
-  So you think of
what Calvin might like
and enjoy and then we'll get something
for him, okay?
- Okay.
-  Does that sound good?
Alright, let's go.
Do you think Calvin would like a shovel?
- No!
-  No, that's right.
Let's try something else.
What about a fan?
-  No!
-  No, okay let's keep lookin'.
- What about a nerf gun?
-  Oh he might like
a nerf gun, that's cool.
-  Yeah.
-  Do you think Calvin would like a
GoPro Hero 6?
I think he would.
- No uh.
-  Okay.
- That's for adults.
(laughing)
Oh, what about batman.
-  Oh I think he likes Batman a lot,
that might be cool.
Jackson, turn around!
- Put it in the cart.
He went, I can go show Jacks!
(laughing)
-  Oh, don't look,
don't look, no peeking,
no peeking, no peeking!
- Did Calvin get a toy for me?
- You guys get out of here.
-  Did you feel
like you did good today?
Did you pick out some
good gifts for each other?
Yeah? Good.
So this is Jackson's favorite way
to travel on the cart.
He likes to face forward
standing on the edge
with his arms holding on backwards.
Kind of like on the front of a ship.
You're like the mermaid
on the front of the ship.
-  Are you ready to help me?
- Yep!
-  Okay this is Calvin's gift.
Do you wanna use that one or this one?
- Um this one.
- Perfect.
I need one piece of tape, ready?
That's a big piece.
Next time do it just a
little smaller, okay?
- Okay.
- Put it right here.
- I wanna piece.
- Put it right here.
Did you have fun today?
- Yeah.
- Did you have fun
picking Calvin out a gift?
- Uh huh.
-  You gonna help wrap the box?
- Yeah!
-  Could put it under the tree,
is that one yours?
It is yours!
- Mine?
-  Yeah, that one is yours.
The one under it is yours.
Look, this one's yours Calvin,
and this one's Jackson's.
-  Mine?
- Yes!
You guys worked so hard today.
That was really fun.
I mean it was a little intense at Target,
having them pick something out,
but we really did try and like let them
find something for the other person,
especially when Jackson found Calvin's,
he was like Calvin would love this!
It was really fun.
- I think these guys
are having a little fun
without me right now,
and I'm about to put it to a stop
so I can come in and join them.
You look so--
- Glad you turned on that light
(laughing)
I'm surprised the kids haven't yet.
- You guys look so cuddly up there.
You guys watching a show?
Uh oh.
(laughing)
After a long day of
driving and getting gifts
and presents and wrapping them,
we're gonna cuddle together on the bed
and watch Troll Hunters.
- What is the one room we use the most
out of the house?
- Oh, one hundred percent our bedroom.
- Even the kids, like
we are in here so much.
- All the time.
- Like whether it's just us getting ready
and the kids are following us,
or they love to lay on our bed,
I think it's kinda fun.
We use our bed a lot (laughing).
- Yes we do.
Jackson is just begging
to turn off the light,
he just hopped off the bed, he's like
okay I'm ready to turn off the light.
You can turn off the light, Jackson.
- Yay!
(laughing)
-  Now onto the show!
-  Onto the show!
Aww, look at Calvin all
cuddled up with you.
- Are you still falling asleep?
Hope so.
- What a wonderful day
we have spent together
as a family.
It is late at night and this little guy
woke up, he looks cranky but he's actually
been pretty smiley.
He woke up and came
into my office to be my
little buddy as I'm editing.
Oh and now he wants to leave, bye!
And that's where I'm
going to leave you guys.
Thank you so much for
watching the video today
and I will see you guys tomorrow, bye!
