start to our day Jackson is still asleep
jared is editing Calvin Calvin and I
have been nothing and kissing and
laughing and smooching some more we have
quite a few meetings today actually and
guess what I pulled out my work moves I
got my work boots I wore these every
single day of my senior year in high
school and don't they look good still I
think my dad polished him up not too
long ago but I grabbed my work boots we
got lots of meetings today house
meetings financial meetings all sorts of
meetings that we got going on today and
I'm really excited about I really am so
excited this whole house-hunting thing
is so fun it's such a big part of our
life right now that I don't know it's
fun sometimes I take another camera with
me and film a little a little bit
because sometimes you know during these
ten five meetings we can't like post
because it has lots of like you know
information personal information that we
just can't post to the whole wide world
right now but sometimes I take another
camera with me just just cuz I'm like
wow this is kind of like really
important and crazy for like Jared and I
and our family so I don't know it's
really fun we gotta get going with our
day though we've got one meeting that
we've got to go to this morning that
we're all going as a family
that has kind of fun that like we all go
together I remember when my mom uh and
she and my dad built their house I
remember going with my mom a lot to like
different meetings that she always had
in Brno it's just really fun
kay Jackson take a spin that suit you
look like John turn around yeah whoa
you look good we need to get you some
work boots the last thing you get for
the kids is I need to get him snow boots
and um I would love to get a little
cowboy that's hurtful
hi

bears is one of my favorite books and I
love the show as well so I threw it up
up there Jackson Calvin are just kind of
playing right now and I'm making
pre-lunch
we're eating a little bit lunch of a
little bit earlier than normal and and I
am making some yummy Apple Cinnamon
crepes oh I've been craving crepes
I love crepes I love dessert crepes so
that is what I'm making Jackson visit
your drum he decided they didn't want to
leave in the kitchen alone so he has an
app on one hand he's drumming in another
and this little kid is sitting in and
his little bump out for like the second
time and you like it you like being in
the kitchen with Mama huh you do I'm
about to go do something that is still
pretty interesting for me to say I'm
going in to a finance meeting and to me
that's just really it's really funny to
say I'm going into a finance meeting
right now and it's gonna be a lot of fun
we're gonna go have lunch so we're
having lunch and talking about finances
getting Jackson in the car show me what
you have son he has three rocks because
he has to have rocks getting in the car
I went to put him in the car and there
are his other rock

and it would you think would be simple
like Jackson you cannot bring the rocks
inside but it just happens he puts him
in his pocket and then he just he has
them so anyway we need to clean out
