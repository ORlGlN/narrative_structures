- I have figured it out.
I finally made the connection.
This may be the weirdest, coolest,
most interesting thing we've
ever received in our PO Box.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Jackson!
- The official name for baby Mecham--
-  What's that?
- Hi moon.
-  Is it a moon?
- Yeah.
-  It's the sun.
- Sun.
- Whoa, I like getting
(laughs) my kids dressed
and Jackson is like,
no let me get dressed,
so Jackson gets dressed, but
you're still young enough
that you like to pick your nose (laughs)
and you let me get you dressed,
which I think is so fun.
So this is actually Jackson's old shirt.
Can you wear Jackson's old shirt?
- Yes.
-  Yes.
- Jackson's this.
-  And we'll put the sun on too.
- His eyes is broke, his eyes broke.
-  They didn't break.
They kinda look broke, huh?
-  Yeah broke.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Hey, go and grab your underwear.
I've told you a hundred times.
Go in the bathroom.
(Calvin yells)
Go grab it.
Hurry, go grab it.
- Hi friend.
Hey friend,
now that's me--
-  Hey Calvin, do
a circle, let's see ya.
Wow, you look so handsome.
(laughing)
-  Hey Mama.
Are you ready for this?
(Ellie groans)
-  Yes.
- Tax preparation.
- Last appointment, let's go.
- So here's the thing, the
folder says tax preparation,
but I'm not sure we're prepared.
For the beating.
- Hey, remember when we
went and got a hot dog?
Corn dog.
- Yeah.
- We should do that again.
- We should.
♪ Corn dogs corn dogs ♪
That's a throw back.
- I don't think I'm ready for this.
- Okay, ready or not, here
we come mister taxman.
♪ On the road again ♪
♪ I can't wait to get on the road again ♪
What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.
- We were laughing because it was silent.
-  That's a good song, I love it.
- Look, the baby can have all my napkins.
-  Oh Ellie, you have
reached a pivotal moment
in your pregnancy.
It's a snack tray now.
- Totally.
- We are on our way to the warehouse.
You guys know that we
did a giveaway for Bollie
on the Bollie Instagram,
and so we're going out to the warehouse,
- We're gonna send your items out.
- Yes we are.
Okay, let's stop talking about that
and talk a little bit
more about how you thought
what I was doing wasn't singing.
- It was like a singing screaming.
-  No, it was legitimate singing.
- It was scringing.
- It was scringing.
- It was so we could hear you.
- Look, I know I can sing.
- I demand a replay.
- Okay you about, what was
the word you just said?
-  Singing.
- No, scringing.
- Scringing.
-  Scringing?
- Scringing, let me tell you another word.
According to my baby app,
I found out a new word, as well
and it's called snissing.
-  Snissing, oh jeez.
- That's peeing when you sneeze.
- Oh.
- Snissing.
-  How many times
do you do that a day?
- We've all done it.
I've done it twice this pregnancy.
-  Oh this pregnancy.
- That time when we were in San Francisco.
- There's a Christmas
cemented in my memory
that we got my mom to laugh so hard
that she peed her pants so bad,
but when you have six kids, that happens.
- Right?
- That's cute.
- It was like the funniest
and most embarrassing thing ever.
(laughing)
We're in the warehouse.
What were you saying?
- The other wieners.
- The other wieners.
We have four winners from
Bonnie and Joel's channel
and we're gonna do four
winners on our channel.
Okay whose next?
- These are the winners
from our Bollie giveaway.
We have robes and workout
outfits and dresses.
Pakistan is one of them
that we are shipping a robe out to.
- Alright, Kelsey from New Zealand.
What?
We want to go to New Zealand.
Wants a robe, boom, here
you go, just for you.
- Kelsey from Chicago
with an acrylic case.
So we're gonna go back and grab that one.
- Hey, Joel's got it right here.
-  You got it,
wow, that was so fast.
Did you wear that muscle shirt
just so you could show off your muscles
while lifting the acrylic case?
- I knew I'd be pumping one acrylic case.
- You'll have to forgive us for some
of the pronunciations of these names.
Sorry.
- Sanay, I think.
- From Australia.
- Australia!
You're getting a robe.
- Yes!
- You guys people love these robes.
-  I know.
- People are obsessed with these robes.
If you want this size--
- I'm obsessed.
- If you want the size that you want,
you better get 'em because
these are running fast, yeah.
-  They're running out.
- These ones are running lower.
Guys, we loved designing the robe.
(Bonnie yells)
That was the funnest
and it's perfect for changing the diapers.
- So many good feedback too.
- Mmm-hmm.
And last but not least,
can we get a drum roll?
Everyone drum roll.
(drum roll)
- Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth from South Carolina.
- That's crazy.
Work out clothes.
- Alright, get your work out on girl.
Boom, look at that color.
- The last one.
- Boom, work out clothes.
- So we're gonna send all these items out.
- Congratulations guys.
- Thanks guys.
Thanks for entering guys
and we are shipping these out.
That was fun.
We had our tax appointment
which turned out pretty--
- That was not fun.
- Which wasn't as bad as I thought.
We were like oh crap, what
are we getting ourselves into.
It was okay, and then this,
it was icing on the cake.
- This was fun,
this was not comparable to taxes at all.
(laughing)
- This was awesome.
I'm glad we did this after taxes,
so now we're going home, we're like yay!
- Pakistan, that's crazy.
- Can you believe that?
- Canada, New Zealand, where else?
- New York, Illinois,
- Canada.
- Yeah everywhere.
- Thank you.
- Thank you guys.
- Congrats on winning.
- Yeah!
This may be the weirdest, coolest
most interesting thing we've ever received
in our PO box before,
and I'm sure that most of you cannot say
that you've ever had this happen to you.
We got a potato.
A potato in our PO box.
Pretty something.
It's growing eyes, so I'm not sure
how long it took to get to us,
but on the reverse side of it,
it says you are one hot potato.
And it is addressed to both Ellie and I,
so whoever sent this,
thank you for telling us
that we are both hot potatoes.
Potato in our PO box.
- You have to run like this.
-  Like that?
-  That's how
you have to do it Dad.
That's how you have to do it?
Oh, what do you think Jackson,
did he do it?
Oh (laughs)
You gotta throw a spin in there Dad.
Whoa!
(laughing)
- He stuck his chest out.
Yeah I'm a little nervous Dad,
I don't want you falling
and hitting your head.
I'm more worried about
you than I am Jackson.
So Grandma and Grandpa are going to take
Jackson and Calvin on a
shhh, special little date.
I think they're gonna go get ice cream
or something like that, so,
hey, are you ready to have a special day
with Grandma and Grandpa?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah!
Are you ready to have a special day
with Grandma and Grandpa?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You're doing the Elaine
dance from Seinfeld.
Hey.
You wanna know something?
Stand up, I wanna tell you something.
I love your shirt.
- No.
- Yeah, your shirt says welcome sun.
And it is truly a good
welcome, become look,
the sun is shining
and it it no longer
snowing, thank goodness!
Okay, get out of my house,
have some fun and listen,
listen young man, you make sure Grandma
and Grandpa behave, okay?
Hey, you make sure Grandma
and Grandpa behave okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Our kids think they're having a great time
with Grandma and Grandpa
and they probably are, but--
- They don't have cinnamon rolls.
- No they don't.
They don't have day old cinnamon rolls
that we were supposed to eat
at our meeting yesterday that we did it,
so Ellie and I are eating--
- I just wrapped up activity days.
We did bracelets today with the girls.
And one of the girls left and goes,
Mr. Mecham is so handsome and fun and nice
and I was like,
she was just talking,
what did she say, she goes,
I'm not surprised that he married you.
(laughs)
- Well I'm tellin' ya,
she speaks the truth.
- It was a cute complement to both of us.
- Yes it was, it certainly was.
Nearly every time we film
in front of this sign,
a bunch of people mention in the comments
about Cody Shark Dee Dee.
And whether that may or may
not not be our baby's name,
I know where it came from, okay?
So obviously Cody is--
-  Jackson's favorite.
- Yeah, our cousin Cody,
but Shark Dee Dee,
where in the world did that come from?
I have figured it out,
I finally made the connection.
Okay, so our kids watch YouTube kids
and on YouTube kids,
there are songs that they sing
and one of the songs is
♪ Baby shark dee doo doo dee dee dee ♪
♪ Baby shark dee doo doo dee doo doo ♪
♪ Mama shark ♪
You know, all of that stuff.
That is where Jackson gets it.
♪ Cody Shark dee dee dee dee dee ♪
♪ Cody Shark dee dee dee dee dee dee ♪
- That's funny.
- That is where he got it from.
Where else would he get it from?
♪ Cody Shark ♪
- I tell ya I like it.
- Yeah, so as you guys
didn't already know,
the official name for baby Mecham,
Cody Shark Dee Dee, officially unofficial.
What's funny about that is
that may be a nickname for him.
I don't know, maybe we'll
call him Cody Shark.
- Like call him little shark.
-  Little shark.
- He might look like a shark.
- What if that's his animal?
- Calvin looked like a turtle
for the first year.
- Mmm-hmm.
- What if our baby's born with teeth
and that's like okay, we call him Shark.
Gross.
- Owie, my boobs.
(Jared laughs)
(Ellie laughs)
-  Jackson!

Just dancing and singing
and doing his hair?
-  Yeah.
- 'Cause you're too old to
have your mom comb your hair?
-  You are too old,
you need to do your own hair today, huh?
- I can't Dad,
because this owie's still here.
- Oh okay.
I don't know what he said,
but his owie's still there.
- Are you done combing it?
-  Mom.
- Mom, this is a delicate process,
it takes time.
- Hey, I think we're done,
come bring it back to me please.
- Look, can we get the
whole family in one shot?
Yeah!
(laughs)
Where's song?
- The song turned off.
- He always says--
- Hey.
(laughs)
-  Look at you.
(laughing)
We got hair cuts today,
so we can look fresh.
- I think I'm good at doing the hair cut.
-  What's that?
- I think good at getting a hair cut.
-  Yes you sure did,
I'm proud of you buddy.
- You are good.
-  Did you get the
toilet paper in there?
- Yes.
Down there.
- Oh it's down there,
okay we gotta make sure
we get it in the toilet.
And make sure the doggie
doesn't get in the toilet,
right, that's the big thing.
-  Okay, everyone's gone potty?
Ready for bed?
- No, I'm supposed to
play with kinetic sand.
- The kinetic sand, guys
they've been playing
with that kinetic sand for
hours.
- Nonstop?
- We just put kinetic sand
in a box, a few rocks.
- Fun filled activities for hours on end.
- My friend the other day
recommended this book to me,
it's called You Are Here.
And I got it on Amazon
and I've only read a few chapters
and I've already really liked it.
I feel like everybody
could benefit from it.
Lately I've been having a hard time
just with a little anxiety
and it's seriously, it's like
I'm just ready for spring
and the sun to come out
and already, it's just
been really fun to read.
And I'm not a huge reader,
so it's been nice to just sit and read.
I usually do that when
I need to decompress,
I will read,
but Jared, his decompress, decompression?
This is what he does.
- Got him, oh yeah!
-  He's been on Twitch lately,
but Jared
- hey!
- I'll come over there and
say hi, you have to tell me.
When we started YouTube, I
was like, what's YouTube?
And then all of a sudden, I was like,
there's beauty videos on YouTube?
I love beauty videos.
I gotta crawl under here.
I was like, I love beauty videos
and I ended up loving it.
Twitch.
- Yeah.
- So Twitch--
-  I don't know
anything about Twitch.
- Okay, so Twitch, obviously,
most people think of it as gaming,
-  Games.
- And a lot of it is,
but a lot of people do
what they call IRL streams,
I know Clintus does that a lot,
where you're vlogging
- chattin'.
- but you're streaming and everything.
Right now, you just came in,
-  Is there make-up girls?
- You know, I think there is.
I think there is,
but there's a lot of people here, look.
We've got Megnog, Chelsea--
- Hi girl.
- Kelly, Spartan Span.
- Because I think it would be fun
to just livestream me getting ready.
Because that's what I love to watch,
but sometimes it's hard to film,
because it's like okay,
we've got about 10 minutes.
It's sometimes overwhelming, but--
- You walked in at a
good time and a bad time.
You walked in right when I got someone
and right when I died.
(laughing)
- Jared just told me what Jackson does.
- So when Jackson and I play together
on the computer,
he'll sit on my lap just
like Ellie is right now.
- Awww.
- And he'll hit the space bar,
which is jump and he'll hit it for me--
-  The guy will jump.
- Yeah I'm on the bus balloon right now.
- So cute.
Has Calvin ever sat in here?
- He hasn't, you know, he hasn't.
- I was gonna say Jackson's
only done it a few times.
That's funny.
- Yeah.
- Well that was a ton of fun.
Ellie had a blast.
She actually hopped on the game
and started playing it
and we had a stream with her,
so that was fun evening.
Thank you guys so much
for watching the video.
If you enjoyed it,
be sure to give it a big thumbs up.
I'll have my Twitch link in
the description down below.
Let us know what games you
want to see me and Ellie play
or just me play.
And we will see you guys next time.
See ya, bye.
