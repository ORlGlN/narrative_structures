- If I get a strike on this first bowl,
the rest of our marriage
years will be perfect, okay?
- A strike?
Well we all know that's unrealistic.
(bright music)
I want to tell you guys what today is.
- Okay.
-  Today is Mommy
and Daddy's anniversary.
- Is it gonna be Halloween?
-  Not Halloween,
it's when Mommy and Daddy
got married, we got
married eight years ago.
And I want to show you something.
You wanna see Calvin?
They're like they don't care,
but if you guys are gonna come on a date,
you gotta see what's going on.
Pick your nose first, get it done.
You good?
(Ellie laughing)
Look, this is when we got married.
- How could you get married like that?
-  We just did.
- Why did you have a crown?
(Ellie laughing)
-  What did he say?
-  Why do you have a crown?
Because I was a princess that day.
-  You want to
know something Jackson?
- Yeah.
- She was my princess that day.
(Ellie laughs)
- But who are you?
-  I was the prince.
-  And he was my prince charming.
Is that cool?
-  How did you get there
to the waterfalls?
-  We just walked to the water fall
and thought it was a pretty picture.
Is that cool?
Okay, so Mommy and Daddy are gonna go
on a date today.
- Oh I want to see the
Where's the chicken hand?
-  (laughs) The chicken hand?
That was just on the vlog
when Daddy was in China.
- Are you in China?
-  No, this is
where we got married.
Cool, huh?
- Why is Aunt Linda there?
-  Aunt Linda came to the wedding,
see Aunt Linda and Uncle Bobo?
-  That's Dad.
-  That's not Dad,
that's Uncle Bobo, say Bobo.
- Bobo.
- That's Jared Jared.
-  That's Uncle Matt goofball.
- Dad, that's Dad!
-  Jared Jared.
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna go
on a special date today.
- Me too?
-  Do you wanna come?
- Where are we gonna go?
- It's a special date for Mommy and Daddy,
so if you're gonna come,
are you gonna be good?
- Is there any kids stuff there?
- No.
Look at his face, look at his face.
Look, I think we're gonna go to lunch,
and then I think we're
gonna go do something fun.
- For big kids?
-  For you too.
It'll be maybe a movie,
or maybe we'll go find
something to do that's fun.
- What about I go to the
toy store and get a toy?
-  Oh that's what you want to do?
- Yeah.
-  Your face looks so distraught.
(laughing)
- Is it way far?
-  It's not far.
We're gonna have a fun day,
and you and Calvin are gonna tag along.
Okay?
Are you still picking your nose?
(Ellie laughing)
- Did I turn four now?
- No, in January.
This conversation is going
off track, quite a bit.
Okay, should we go?
- Yeah.
-  Do you guys wanna
go, or should we stay here?
- I wanna come.
-  You wanna come.
Calvin, what did you today
that was really cool.
What did you do in the bathroom?
- Poop.
-  What was that?
What did you do in the bathroom?
- I pooped.
-  Good job.
-  Happy anniversary Ellie,
we have no furniture.
- Woo.
- Here's some parrots.
- Let me see.
-  Isn't that cool?
Daddy's showing him what birds those are.
-  Can you tell me what they are?
What's the red one?
- Parrot.
-  That's right.
And what's the black one?
- Toucan.
- That's right, that's a toucan.
-  Yep, Daddy just
taught you that, huh.
We're at our favorite Mexican restaurant.
- For our anniversary.
Happy anniversary, happy
anniversary, happy happy.
-  Happy eight years.
- Can you believe we've
been with each other
for eight years?
Well we've been together for longer,
but we've been married for eight years.
-  It's crazy.
- We made it through the seven year itch.
(laughs)
- Yeah, what year do you think
has been our hardest?
- Well the only itch that
we've gone through is
-  I've been doing
a lot of nose picking,
don't judge me.
I'm glad that we have the
boys here, this is fun.
- Yes, this is fun to celebrate with them.
-  What year do you
think has been the hardest?
I remember the first wasn't,
because after the first year,
we were like, that wasn't bad at all.
- No it wasn't bad at all.
I would say years.
- Three might have been the hardest.
- I would say three,
between six and seven.
-  But guess what?
- We'll get through it together,
because we're a team.
-  Love you.
- I love you.
It's getting through that,
it's getting over that together
that makes everything so
much better, you know?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
- Go go go go go!
-  Hi.
-  Jackson, that's
enough, that's good.
You don't need that (laughs).
Hey, who taught him that dance move?
- I don't know, but they were pretty good
so it must've been me.
- That one.
-  Can you show
us some dance moves?
- No!
- Oh.
I be you never thought
you'd be ending up here
on our eight anniversary.
We're going bowling.
- I was telling Jared,
it's like happy anniversary Jackson.
Jackson has been jumping and screaming
and is so excited.
-  He can't get
those shoes on fast enough.
That is so funny.
Hey Jackson are you excited to go bowling?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Aww yeah, you ready?
Dude you're gonna kill
it today, I know it.
Poor little Calvin fell
asleep on the way here.
- Why does that have a crunchy mouth?
-  Because he loves those pins,
he gonna eat all those pins,
just like your bowling ball
is gonna eat all those pins down there.
- Are you ready to rumble?
- I'm ready.
Okay, so here's the deal Ellie.
This is our bet, okay.
If I get a strike on this first bowl,
the rest of our marriage
years will be perfect, okay?
-  A strike?
- A strike.
That's all I have to do.
If I get a strike, our
marriage will be perfect.
- Okay.
- Forever.
- Well we all know that's unrealistic.
Okay let's see.
- You don't think I can
get a strike, do you?
- No I, come on, let's see it.
(laughing)
- Ready?
-  Yeah.
(pins knocking)
- Oh!
(Ellie laughing)
(dramatic music)
- Perfect years.
That's awesome.
That's awesome.
- Woo!
-  He is so ready.
Let Mama go and then it's your turn okay?
- Okay, I mean what's your
deal, what's your deal?
- Well I know I'm not gonna get a strike.
-  Okay (laughs).
- If I hit more than five pins,
you put kids to bed tonight.
-  Oh okay okay.
(pins clanking)
Oh!
- You get to put the kids to bed tonight.
-  Okay Jackson, your turn buddy.
Whoa.
Oh my gosh.
- What?
-  10 pins, look at that.
- Look at how good you did.
-  That's so good, high five.
You get to go again too.
- Yeah.
I got them all.
-  You got a full strike.
That was cool
That was cool.
- I get a prize!
(Ellie laughs)
I need to get all of them down.
(pins knocking)
- Oh!
- Oh!
-  So close, you did good,
let's try and hit that last one.
- Let's see if you can get that last one.
Oh my what,
you did it!
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah I won!
You guys lose.
(laughing)
Because I won.
-  You just had a sore pity party.
- That turned around real quick.
(groovy upbeat music)
- What?
- Yeah!
- You won.
- Yay I get a prize!
- You won.
You beat Mom and you beat Dad.
What the heck?
- Jackson got 115.
- 101, what did you get?
- I got 94, but I will say,
in my personal defense,
for my own dignity.
- Yes.
- I gave Jackson a strike
that I thought was my own.
- True, true.
-  So I think that
would've done it for me,
I don't know.
Hey bud, was that fun?
- I'm gonna get a prize.
- You will get a prize.
But guess what, you played,
and you played hard
and you won, didn't ya?
I'm proud of you.
- He got a little cocky for a second.
- Yes he did.
We gotta shrink that head a little bit.
- Seriously, he was like, Jackson?
- We're doing a little swaparoo.
Calvin woke up from his nap
and Jackson fell asleep.
What do you have Calvin?
Can you show us what
you have in your hand?
(gasps)
What is it?
Cookie.
Cookie.
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate our anniversary,
- But he's eating mine.
- Than going to Swig and
getting some cookies.
(Penny barking)
It's about that time Ellie.
Gotta take Penny for a walk.
She's asking for it.
- She saw us, she wants a cookie too.
- Okay do you want to see it?
Are you ready for it?
This is the first time I've seen it,
but it's done, it's finished.
Sanded, smoothed, polished,
(pop) it's a little fumy in here,
(laughs) it's a little fumy in here,
but this is the floor redone.
It looks pretty good, it
looks very very shiny.
We have to be off of
it, for a little while,
like another hour or so before
we can start walking on it.
And then I think we'll wait until tomorrow
before we put the furniture back,
but it looks great, it looks awesome.
And to celebrate our anniversary,
we're having dinner in the basement.
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.
- Mom's not cooking.
-  Woo!
- At all today.
- Because we can't eat anywhere else.
Holy Schnikes, oh save the bag.
We don't have a table upstairs, but we do
Oh we have a table down here.
- Oh cute, I'd rather
just sit on the floor.
- You do that, maybe I'm
gonna eat at the table,
because I have a hip condition.
-  Jared doesn't like to sit.
- It's true.
As much as I want to,
I'd like to sit on the floor,
but my hips can't take it.
That's probably the one thing
that's really really inhibiting for me
and limiting, because I can't sit
criss cross applesauce very easily.
- Muscles!
-  Oh look at you muscle man.
Here let me help ya.
Oh good job.
Oh my goodness.
What is he drinking?
Oh you have a little cup
for him full of water.
- He wanted to drink out of this
so I said go to the kitchen
and he got a mini cup.
- Cute.
Kids come here, we need to have a talk
Alright, and I need you to listen.
Mom and Dad had a bet earlier today,
the bet was if Mom hit
more than five pins,
then I would put you to
bed, okay, both of you.
You and you.
They're obviously not even
listening to me Ellie.
- No no bedtime.
- So here's the deal,
I'm gonna put you kids to bed,
this place is a disaster down here,
so you're gonna clean up?
- No!
(Jared laughing)
-  Just the
dinner, just the dinner.
- No I'll pick up.
-  What are you doing?
(laughing)
Calvin, what are you boys doing?
Ahhh!
Hey, oh no, it's attack of the dead.
Ahhh!
Aww, you're giving me hugs.
I love that attack.
Well there you have it,
eight years in the books.
I can't believe it's been eight years,
'cause sometimes when I
think about eight years,
it seems like so short,
but when you look back,
it seems like such a long
time too, it's so crazy.
And every year has been so different
for Ellie and I and our anniversaries.
I mean looking back to the first year,
(laughs)
I think our first anniversary
was our worst anniversary,
but not in a bad way,
but like our car axle broke
on our way to a romantic weekend getaway
and we couldn't do it anymore.
Like Ellie's parents and
a neighbor had to come
pick us up, because we
didn't have a car to drive.
We were driving out of
my grandma's house area
or something like that and
poof, the axle just broke.
We were just talking about our memories
of our anniversaries and
it just takes me back
and I just am really excited
about the anniversaries
and all the other momentous occasions
that Ellie and I will
be celebrating together
as we live life together.
I love her so much
and she means the world to me.
And I'm so grateful to
have her in my life.
So with that, I'm gonna end the vlog.
Thank you guys for watching.
Happy anniversary Ellie,
and we'll see you guys next time.
Bye.
