-  What dance moves
did Bonnie just teach Jackson?
(laughs)
- Good job, Jackson! What a great helper!
We have created fire!
Good morning and happy Saturday.
Today is the day before The Big Game
cause I guess you're not
allowed to say Super Bowl.
I mean, oops
-  Why?
- I said it. For these legal reasons.
Like NBC, I think, or I can't
remember which network it is,
has the legal rights to
the word Super Bowl, and--
- And so people say The Big Game.
- That's exactly right like
on commercials and everything.
- I'm learning.
- You gettin' ready for The Big Game?
Yeah, it's all legal stuff.
-  That's crazy.
- But we are going to get ready for the,
enter legal appropriate name, Big Game.
- I'm on grocery list duty.
-  Guess what duty I am on?
- What duty do you have?
- I'm on poop patrol! Doody duty!
(laughs)
(laughs)
- You and the kids do poop duty.
And, oh wood. Where am
I going to buy that?
- Um, I think they would
actually have some there too.
- And maybe in the mountains,
I could go chop down a tree.
- Yeah. I have an ax in the four wheeler
and the trailer, so.
- We used to do that
growing up at our house.
We just, we had trees that my
dad would make wood out of.
But we need some wood for the fire pit.
- Yeah, because we're having
a pre-party football game,
Big Game party.
Tonight, we've got some
family coming over,
and we're gonna have
a little get together,
and we're gonna do some fun stuff.
So, we've gotta get the yard picked up.
We've gotta get the house,
the house is pretty much picked up.
Thanks, mom. Like killin' it yesterday.
And Ellie is going grocery shopping
getting some Super Bowl snacks.
So, what are your favorite
Super Bowl snacks?
I know that we have a
video on Ellie's channel
about Super Bowl--
-  That was forever ago.
- Yeah, when we lived in our old place.
About our favorite Super Bowl snacks.
So, I'll have that linked down below.
So, you guys can check that out.
I know it's after the Super Bowl,
but it's still good snacks.
- Um, bean dip. We're making bean dip.
Smokies, chips, drinks, candy,
veggie tray, fruit tray.
All of it.
- Gosh, it is a beautiful day today.
I'm wearing my hoodie and vest,
and I don't even think I
need it, it's that beautiful.
But here's the thing, all
of the snow is melting.
So, it's the perfect opportunity
to get all those poops
that Penny has left us,
those little surprises,
and pick those up so
the yard is all clean.
But, here's how Utah works.
Utah is this glorious place
where the mountains are beautiful.
The weather is always changing.
And because the snow is
all melting right now,
and it's still barely the
beginning of February,
I guarantee you that we'll have
at least one more big snowfall.
So, we're not done with
winter yet, not even close.
I can't remember what Groundhog
Day was supposed to say,
if it was Spring is coming
or we have to wait six more weeks.
But I guarantee we will have
at least one more big snowfall
that covers everything
where we'll have to plow
and do all of that stuff.
Because that's how Utah works.
If you're not satisfied
with the weather in Utah,
wait five minutes.
(playful music)
What'd you find?
- A treasure map.
-  A treasure map?
Do you think there's treasure somewhere?
- Uh, yeah.
-  Yeah, we'll have to look around.
Where did we find treasure before?
- When we were at our ninja--
- Yeah.
Well when I'm all done picking up poo,
maybe we can find some treasure.
- Hey, there's some.
- Yeah, there's some too.
The kids have been helping
me find all of the poop,
and I'm just like,
"Please don't step in
it, Gavo, Gavo, Gavo!"
Don't step in it. They're little helpers.
- Poo poo.
- Yeah, good job.
Alright. Here is what I want you to do.
We've got the leaf blower.
Pretty sweet, right?!
We are going to blow some
of this dirt and stuff
back where it belongs in between the rocks
with all the bark and all of that. Okay.
Now, pull the trigger.
(motor revs)
Yeah! You're doing great bud!
Good job! Woo!
Yeah! Good job, buddy!
Good job, Jackson! What a great helper!
Yes! He's old enough to help.
(laughs)
(upbeat music)
(laughs)
- I just grabbed the camera and mic.
Hey, you two are making soup
for tomorrow and tonight.
The boys are out playing,
and Jackson is doing his favorite thing.
This is their favorite thing
to to do at Aunt Bonnie's.
Whoop!
(laughs)
So nerve racking.
-  I'm scared
they're gonna hit their bums
on the floor.
(screams)
(laughs)
You just rolled across the floor!
(upbeat music)
What dance moves did
Bonnie just teach Jackson?
(laughs)
We don't invite people
to our dance parties
because usually they don't
end up how they should.
I'm not filming that.
(upbeat music)
- And we're back.
So, we went shooting
while the girls hung out,
cooked, did fun stuff with
the kids, and we're back home.
But the night is not over yet.
In fact, it is just beginning.
We've got Ellie's parents coming over,
Landon and Julie coming over,
Bonnie and Joel coming over,
and we're all going to
hang out and have some food
and get in the hot tub,
and I think we may even
have a little campfire.
But it's cold outside,
especially at the night time.
And we've had these guys, whoop,
these guys here for a while.
They are patio heaters, and
they have yet to be assembled.
So while Ellie is getting
the kids ready for bed,
I'm going to assemble a
patio heater, maybe two,
maybe three, I don't know. We'll see.
In between, I know this is crazy,
but in between the hot
tub and the campfire,
we're going to see if we
can have patio heaters.
As if that's not enough warmth,
we want to put patio heaters
there so we can sit out
and talk and enjoy each other's company,
outside the hot tub, outside
of the fire. I don't know.
It sounds weird when I'm
talking about it, guys.
Just bare with me, we're going
to put this together, okay.
(upbeat music)
Alright. We've got her all assembled.
So, we've got a hot spot here,
a hot spot there,
a hot spot here.
So, I don't know like a hot spot here.
That's a mobile hot spot.
(laughs)
There we go. Yeah buddy! There we go!
We have created fire!
- We have made fire!
Hey!
- It might smell funny for a second.
- And that white smoke,
well known fact, toxic to humans.
(laughs)
- Look how it just like
lights up the metal.
You know. It's so hot,
it's just like, ooh.
That's so cool.
-  It's always a fun
day when mom gets her hair cut.
Bonnie's turn this time.
(laughs)
We switch up.
The boys have been outside
like laughing and yelling.
I don't even know what
they're laughing about.
Oh, I thought that was Penny.
You can see them all huddled out there.
I was like, "You should
build a fire tonight."
But they built the fire warmer and stuff.
(upbeat music)
- The two little pregnant ladies.
Not so little though, are you?
Three, two, one.
I think it's absolutely crazy
insane that you are pregnant,
you are pregnant, Emily's
pregnant, Emily is pregnant,
and Jennifer is pregnant.
So many people in our family
are pregnant right now,
and that's very exciting.
And we're the only one having a boy.
-  I think that's cool.
(laughs)
-  Penny. Penny.
She has made her rounds to
every single person 100 times.
She just kind of stays away from Bonnie.
(laughs)
- What? No.
(laughs)
- Well, we kicked everyone out
of our house because frankly,
we just don't like the guests.
The guests have just been too much,
and it wasn't as fun as
we thought it would be.
Oh! I mean, maybe not everyone.
But that is gonna be it
from us tonight, guys.
Tomorrow is The Big Game.
We're talking about how legally,
we can't say Super Bowl.
I mean, The Big Game. You
know because legal stuff.
Anyway, thanks for watching guys.
If you enjoyed the vlog,
give it a big thumbs up.
And we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
