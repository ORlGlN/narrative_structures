-  A father of three, almost.
- Aahh!!
- One wrong move, I could fall through.
- What the heck?
- Is this momma, am I momma?
(lauging)
- That's the only person
that he would ever say mm-hm.
Normally he'd be like no.
-  Cut it all off!
- Not too intense tense,
but enough that I want a little ponytail.
- This is kinda weird.
- Ah!
- Oh, it's a little ponytail.
Oh that's so pretty.
-  That's funny.
- Aside from being an incredible handyman,
Joel is like, a master electrician.
Is it master or journeyman,
or what's your title?
- Neither of those, but
it is master electrician
but I'm not qualified.
- Qualified.
We've got some electrical
stuff that we're working on
and we've got the ladder hooked up
and Joel and I are gonna go in the attic.
And this is the first time,
I said addict.
We're going into the at-tic.
Not addict.
And we're gonna go check it out.
This is the first time
I've ever been up there.
-  What?
- Yeah, I've peaked in there
but I've never gone up in there.
I think we did a video,
we peaked up in there
and I took a couple of steps and
I was like I don't wanna
fall through the ceiling.
So Joel is gonna lead the way
and I'm gonna follow him
and we're gonna look around.
Pretty cold up there?
- Yeah, that's a good sign.
So grab your joists, yeah.
You wanna put all your weight on joists
and come up and put your foot on that one
that's crossbeam over there if you can.
Yeah, lift up and set
your feet on that one.
(bouncy music)
A father of three, almost.
Your body's moving like it, too.
- Did it.
-  Doneski.
- So if you look over there,
you can see how deep this is.
22, 20 inches deep, of insulation.
-  Which is why your
house stays nice and warm.
- Yeah, boy!
So Joel and I are gonna
crawl down through there
in momentarily and we'll pull some wiring
through the entrance of the
attic down through there.
K, here's a little update.
Julie!
(bouncy music)
You look so great!
- Oh well, thank you.
- It is really cute.
- Good job.
- I cut it a little shorter than I wanted.
- That's okay.
- I was gonna say, that's
the beauty of hair,
is that it grows back.
Joel, you look like Spider-Man.
- That's what they call me
in the electrical business.
- Probably one of the
dumbest things I'm doing
is vlogging and crawling through
the attic at the same time.
One wrong move, I could fall through.
We've got some wiring that we're
threading through over here
to get in a couple of extra outlets.
And luckily Joel knows what he's doing
and I'm here for moral support
and to be his assistant.
- You just put the assist in assistant.
-  Oh thank you.
(lauging)
- Jared, I know you're not supposed
to covet your neighbors wife,
or your brother in law's wife
but I covet my brother in law's attic.
This is huge.
This is amazing to work in this.
- It's pretty cool.
Okay, we are above the patio.
You fall through here, you
don't have carpet to land on.
Okay, we are wiring all this through,
wrapping around up and
down, left and right,
sideways and backways for an outlet there.
We're gonna put an outlet over there,
we're gonna put an outlet over there,
and we're gonna put an outlet over here.
So three outlets.
It's starting to get hot.
Reminds me of the days
that I worked as a roofer.
Summer days, you get too hot,
the roofing material would like, melt,
and you would slide down.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's segment of
Jared and Joel go in the
attic and fix things.
Luckily, we did everything
that we were supposed to
before it started raining.
We have some rain and guess what?
That means it's not snow.
It's warm enough that it's not snow.
Thank goodness, oh my goodness gracious.
Okay, so now we're gonna
turn into another segment
where Jared and the kids do
some fun educational things.
So let's turn the time
over to that right now.
So last time we were here
we did a fun experiment
where we made a cloud in a bottle.
Jackson has been asking
so many questions lately
about the environment, the sky, the grass,
the colors of the world.
And I thought it would be fun
to answer these questions on
video with science experiments.
So one of the questions that Jackson asked
while we were on our drive
home from Las Vegas was
Why do clouds rain?
- Because there's thunder.
- That's close, now look,
is it raining outside?
- Yeah.
- So what if I told you, Jackson,
it's raining outside, but
what if we could make it rain
inside our house?
- Yeah.
- Would that be cool?
- Yeah.
- Should we try to make
it rain inside our house?
- Yeah.
- Or maybe, inside this bottle?
- Yeah.
- Okay, so what we're going
to do is to make it rain
we're going to learn--
- We're going to get water!
- That's right.
We're gonna learn about the water cycle
and what happens when rain forms.
Okay, so the first
thing that we need to do
so we need to take this
bottle and we're gonna
take the lid off of it.
Whoops.
And we're gonna put some
water inside of here.
- What about I hold it
and you put the water in?
- That's a great idea.
Let's go do that right now.
Okay, so we need some hot, hot water.
- Why?
- So this is on the hot setting, so just
be careful with your hands.
I'm gonna help you guide it in there.
You got it?
Okay, so we've got hot water.
Now on this part of the bottle,
we need to fill this with ice, okay?
Where do you think we can get some ice?
Yeah.
(cubes rattling)
- Okay, we got some ice.
Now, let's take this to the table.
Okay, so we've got our hot water here
and we've got our ice here.
- No, warm water.
- Oh, okay, it's warm water.
So what we're gonna do now--
- It turned into warm water.
- We're gonna put this on top of here.
Can you do that?
Don't dump it.
Just put it right on top.
Just like that, okay.
So what happens in the
world when we get rain
is the water in the oceans
and in the ground and in the lakes,
the sun beats on it
and it's nice and warm,
and then that water, right
here, turns into a gas
called water vapor.
- What's water vapor?
- It's the gas form of water.
And then water vapor goes up into the sky
and it stays there and then
it hangs out with all of
the other water vapors.
And there's all of this dust,
and all of these other things
up in the sky--
- Into clouds!
- And they turn
into the clouds, that's exactly right.
And it's cold up there
and because it's cold.
- Now it's cold out there.
- That's right and because
it's cold that water gets heavy
and the water vapor goes
from a gas back to a liquid.
And when that water gets
heavy enough in the clouds,
they drop.
And what do you think that's called,
when water falls from the sky?
- Rainclouds.
- That's right. Rain.
- So what we have here is we
have warm water, or hot water,
and that's gonna raise
up and evaporate in here.
- In the ice?
- Yup, and once it hits
the cold ice it's going
to gather up on the bottle
and it's going to condense
and there'll be condensation.
And once that condensation gets heavy,
it's going to fall down like
rain, back into the water.
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna wait here
and let the water cycle happen
and we'll see if we can
see any rain come, kay?
Should we wait?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(bouncy music)
Come here Jackson!
Come here, bud.
Do you see the droplets on the cap?
- Yeah.
- All of that came and
that's how clouds rain.
Is the water heats up, turns into a gas,
gets cold again and mom's home!
Hi guys.
- That looks cool.
- Look mom, it's raining.
Do you see all these water droplets?
- Yeah.
- That's where the rain comes
from once it's heavy enough.
Just like that, that's what rain is like.
Pretty cool, huh?
- Can I put my finger in it?
- Sure, it might be a little hot.
Is it hot?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.
Jackson, it's raining inside our house.
What are we doing?
This is, I knew we'd get rain in here
but I didn't think we'd get rain in here.
This is crazy.
I'm all wet.
Are you all wet?
It's raining inside our house.
Is this crazy or what?
This science experiment
has gone a little too far.
- I think I'm gonna run away and run away.
- Okay, let's run away.
Let's get out of here.
(yelling)
Ah, It's raining everywhere, Jackson!
Are you dry?
Have you found a dry spot?
- It's dry here in your office.
- Oh this is dry?
Oh my goodness.
- This is the dry place.
- Thank goodness, I'm so
glad you found a dry place.
I can't believe it was
raining inside our house.
Luckily you found the
dry place, that's good.
Good, the sword is keeping
your hair dry, perfect.
Well I am so happy that it was
raining outside and not snowing outside.
I think spring is finally upon us.
But in Utah there is
always that one random snow
in the middle of May,
right around Mother's Day.
Right when you want to plant
flowers for your sweet mother
we get one more snow and
it ruins all those flowers.
Calvin has been having
this strange thing that
whenever we kiss him, he wipes it away.
Hey!
Why are you wiping it away?
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay.
Hey, why are you wiping it away?
That's my love that
I'm giving this to you.
Let's see if we can sneak one on Calvin.
Oh!
Hey I thought I would get away with that.
It's the funniest thing.
I've got your arms.
You can't wipe it away.
And just like that the night is upon us
and everyone is already in bed.
And we are about to zonk out.
I wanted to say thank you guys.
So many of you have sent
me awesome recommendations
for experiments and
activities for me and the boys
to do together and I can't wait to do
more of those fun educational things.
So thank you guys for
sending me all of those.
But on that note, we are
going to end the vlog.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
If you enjoyed that experiment
that I did with Jackson
and kinda Calvin, give
the video a big thumbs up
and we will see you guys next time.
Side note, before it's actually over.
There wasn't actually rain in the house.
It's all special effects.
There was rain in the bottle though.
Kind of.
Condensation that dripped down.
You know how it is.
