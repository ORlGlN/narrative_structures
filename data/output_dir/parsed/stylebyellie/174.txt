(spooky organ music)
-  Well good morning.
-  Look at the boat.

- The boat.
-  You see the boat?
That is so cool.

- Good morning.
-  Did you sleep good?
- Yeah.
-  Good.
Come outside.
Come look outside.
What do you see?
Say, land ho!

We're at our first port.
We are in Mexico.
This is amazing.
It's gorgeous, it's beautiful Ellie.
- Ready to play in the water?
-  Yes.
(Latin-style guitar music)
So what are you thinking right now?
- I'm thinking realistically
I would love it,
the kids might hate this (laughs).
- Yeah.
(rain falling)
My thinking with all of this is,
let's just embrace it.
This is not gonna be like
this the entire time,
so let's just embrace
it, have fun, have fun,
in the rain, you know what I mean?
Like just have fun in the rain.
-  Tots, Jackson, are
you gonna have fun in the rain?
- We're gonna play in the water anyway.
- Are you gonna have fun in the rain?
-  Are you gonna
have fun in the rain?
- No.
(Jared laughing)
I want to go swimming in the water.
-  You want to go
swimming in the water?
- Yeah.
-  How about swimming in the water,
in the rain?
- No.
(tropical beat music)
- Today we are on the beautiful beach
of Cozumel, Mexico.
- Look at this one I found.
-  Wow.
Here we go.
- Yeah!
(underwater bubbles)
- Is the water warm?
-  Oh it's bathwater warm.
- Oh let's go look at it.

You having fun?
Mmm-mmm (laughs).
Good job.

It taste like salt.
- Yeah.
- Cozumel, Mexico.
- Bye bye.
- The storm is coming in
and everybody is coming under the area
where we're eating.
Jared just went to grab all of our stuff.
(yells)
They've been doing so
good to stay close to us.
You got all of our stuff.
- I got all of our stuff.
Did you hear that thunder?
-  Yes
- That was so big.
- My hood on.
- Are you okay?
-  Oh you want the hood on?
This changed from paradise to downpour
in a matter of seconds.
Two thunder strikes.
- Everyone just came in to eat,
and we're actually done.
We're gonna try to grab
a taxi and head out.
- Head back.
It was so funny.
Everyone was at the pool, and was like,
oh I'm having a good time,
I'm having a good time.
(mock thunder)
You know what, I'm actually
really hungry right now.
We're gonna get out of
the pool and eat lunch.
(laughing)
- Okay let's go.
- Let's go.
You okay in there Jackson?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you okay?
It's actually not raining too bad.
-  Hey no one's in the pool.
- Let's go swimming, no one's in the pool.
We're only doing it during a
(thunder)
a lightning storm.
(laughing)
- Where are we going?
- Look, we're under cover now.
We're under the cover.
(tropical beat music)
Smile one two three.
We are back at our room
and throughout this trip,
we've been here for three days,
we've kind of followed a little schedule
and that schedule is wake up,
eat breakfast, do an activity.
About lunchtime, have a nap,
then do another activity,
and dinner time, then a
small activity, bed time.
Right now, we are in the middle of the day
and the kids are on their nap
right now, how sweet.
- They have been so good,
because they are so tired.
- Yes they are.
They're both zonked right now.
But when they wake up,
they are in for a surprise.
Ellie you seem like you're dressing up
for something in particular.
- I'm gonna get my boots
on and you'll know why.
-  Ooh.
-  Good morning.
-  Good morning.
How are you?
-  Do you want to get
dressed, and we can go play?
- Yeah.
(crying)
- This is kinda scary.
Is it kinda scary?
- Yeah.
-  We'll get dressed.
-  Let's get dressed
up at Buzz Lightyear.
Okay?
Don't you shoot your laser at me.
- Who is ready for a Mousequerade?
You are!
The whole family is all dressed.
Everybody's getting ready to go.
(upbeat lively music)
-  Yeah!
You did it!
-  Woo!
- You did it, you did it buddy.
Was that fun?
Do you want to do it again?
- No.
(laughing)
(clapping)
(cheering)
- And that is a Halloween wrap up.
We have trick or treated.
Calvin, can I see your baggie?
We have trick or treated,
got lots of candy.
We found a wheel that we are playing with.
Jackson, did you enjoy the party?
- Yes.
-  What was your favorite part?
- I got a treasure for this wheel.
-  Oh fun.
- Yes, I'm showing him all my tricks
from piratry.
So here's the deal.
I've tried to make an attempt
to you know, plunder the
ship, take it as my own.
Call it mine like the Black Pearl.
But then I realized, I
only work with sails.
This is an entirely
different kind of ship.
I wouldn't know what I was doing,
plus there's family on board.
I don't want to mess with that,
that's a whole other area
you don't want to mess with.
- Not mama bears.
- Not mama bears.
They're the worse kind of bears.
(romantic Italian music)
- Tonight we are having dinner at the Palo
which is the fanciest
restaurant on the ship.
You have to have a
reservation well in advance,
and we were lucky enough to have one.
And we are going to enjoy ourselves.
- And I love it.
It is beautiful.
You can see the ocean right now.
Happy date night.
-  And now this
is for you Miss Ellie
and you can decide if you want to share.
-  Okay (laughs).
Is it good?
- Yeah.
-  Alright Jared liked the olive,
all of this is like an
appetizer that's been aged,
for a very long time,
so I'm gonna try this olive.
That was really strong.
- That's good.
-  Strong flavors, it is good.
- Yeah the sauces make it really nice too.
This dinner is so fun,
it's all north Italian based.
We're having intermezzo right now,
just in between the meal, a lemon sorbet.
- And it refreshes your
palate and gets you ready for
- Yeah, food in between
the food, it's fun,
this is so fun.
- It's like a dessert in between dinner,
it's like Ellie's
- Ellie's normal schedule.
- Ellie's go to thing.
- Yeah.
- Is that an animal maded?
- I don't know what do you think it is?
- It's a ghost.
-  It looks like a ghost.
Or a bat.
- Should I touch it?
-  No.
-  Or a bat.
(yelling)
-  Want to touch it?
-  You want to touch it?
-  It's head fell off.
- It's just a towel.
Isn't that cool?
That they can make these
animals out of towels?
- Yeah.
- We had lobster, we had
-  Mickey Mouse.
- Mickey Mouse and now we had a bat.
Hey, did you have fun today?
- Yes.
- Hey did you have fun today?
Yeah?
Hey did you have fun today?
- Yes.
-  You look so cute in that robe.
- Thank you, they should
sell 'em at the gift shop.
-  Oh my goodness,
they have 'em in our closet.
- I know, for free.
So I'm just wearing it.
