Today we are touring
Guilin Bay, Shangri-La.
We're taking another boat tour
of these beautiful mountains.
Oh my gosh, I've never
seen anything like it.
I've never seen any mountains like this.
They just poof shoot up
out of nowhere.
Pointy.
We've gotta go right now
or we're gonna be late.
I think everyone is gonna be down there,
in approximately one minute ago.
(laughs)
(traditional Chinese music)
So I take that back, we are early.
No one's here.
We're not late.
No one's here.
So either everyone is really late
and we're just normal late,
or we're on time or early
and everyone else is not quite early.
I'm not sure how to classify this,
but we're here.

Our bus driving has been laughing
really hard at us,
and he may have recorded us,
and so we are trying to find
a song we can all dance to
and give him a good
show that he can record.
Anything for a show, right?
I think he thinks it's funny, yeah.
That is the party bus right there.
(atmospheric music)
I have an announcement to make,
I'm on a boat.
♪ I'm on a boat ♪
(laughing)
(atmospheric music)
Everyone's waving,
that's cute.
(Jared laughing)
-  Oh safety first.
You know if you fall in,
you gotta be really careful.
-  Yeah.
Sometimes you just gotta float.
-  Right.
These mountains are so
like unbelievable, like
that looks like a painting.
(light jazzy music)
And we're on a cruise right now,
do you see the mountains behind me?
Yes, they're incredible.
Isn't that crazy?
I'm Facetiming my dad and
we're in China right now.
Isn't that crazy?
-  Hi.
Hi.
-  Thanks for
taking care of our babies.
(light jazzy music)
The best part about this three hour cruise
is not only the beauty,
but the lunch is provided.
We're all in line, having lunch.
Bonnie is pulling up her pants,
Jase is doing a dance.
We are walking through
the city of Yongzhou
(cars honking)
and all of the kids are
on a field trip right now.
All of the kids in the yellow hats
are on a field trip.
It's just so fun to see
all the little kids.
(laughs)
It's crazy walking through this town.
You really had to get out of them.
Because everyone is trying
to sell you a taxi, sell you an item,
and they grab onto you and everything.
Oh I wasn't thinking that,
I was thinking, get out of the streets,
because they will run you over.
Oh that's true too.
(cars honking)
The yellow one's don't stop.
I'm kind of just in awe
of the street right here,
like this is unbelievable.
Tons of shops.
Yeah, it's just, this is what I envisioned
inland China to be.
Look at this.
This is so cool.
I did buy a sweater guys.
-  Ooh let's see.
Did you barter a good price?
Actually Bonnie did.
Honestly, it looks like Burberry,
like it's so nice.
-  And it feels good.
-  Look at this.
Look at this alleyway.
That's so cool, the Chinese lanterns,
that's so awesome.
So Dad and I already
bought a gift for Jackson
and we are looking at
something for Calvin.
And I saw these cute nightlights.
Look how cute they are,
and that one over there is a dog.
So she's checking the lights.
The bulbs in 'em.
Yeah.
Aww, I think he'll really like that.
We got something for Jackson as well,
because we wanted both the
boys to have something like
from China, like Jackson's
was more like a toy
that we found, but he's gonna love.
We got each of the boys a little drum.
-  Yes.
It's hand made and everything.
And it looks really cool.
-  I think Jackson
will really like it.
Yeah.
The next step on our
adventure is Shangri-La.
The city of heaven, is that what it is?
Yeah.
This is beautiful.
Like everything else.
The most beautiful city
In the world.
It is just heaven.
-  Yeah, what?
It's just heaven.
Oh just heaven, this is heaven.
-  You are in heaven.
We made it Ellie.
We did it.
(laughing)
-  Ellie, we're here.
After all this work, we're here.
No no, not without my babies.
-  So this is heaven.
(laughing)
It sounds like you're being mean.
-  You boys are
all being a little mean.
-  Okay I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
The greenery and the trees,
everything is so different.
And this tree is so interesting to me.
Look at the
Isn't that crazy?
Thank you.
Nihao.
-  We've been on some boats today,
but this one is another one, huh?
Come sit down next to me Ellie,
I saved you a seat.
I saved you a seat.
Nihao.
Hello.
Aloha.
-  Hello.
We were talking about dinner
and the tour guide just offered us
Dog.
Dog for dinner.
You don't think we could woof that down?
It might be a little ruff.
Everyone made a joke and
I thought, no thank you.
But I guess dog is popular
here and the Philippines.
Look at this view Ellie.
-  Everyone's gonna film it,
so I'm just gonna film everybody filming
what everyone wants to film.
(gentle piano music)
Oh hey ho hey I'm ready!
I'm ready this time, I'm ready.
-  It's all you,
it's all you, it's all you.
Oh!
(siren beat music)
Ahh, I'm gonna get one.
I'm gonna get one, I'm gonna get one.
Oh, no!
She said last one?
-  That be your
last, that's the end.
-  Yay!
Yay, Jared!
(laughing)
-  You did it.
I got one.
What is it?
What is it?
I feel like the little
kid at the baseball game
that catch a ball and--
-  Here's your snow cone, bud.
You get one for playing.
(speaking in foreign language)
(laughing)
-  Wave to us, say hi.
-  Hi.
They've taken all of
our pictures a few times
and they love Jared.
Everyone loves you,
because Jared was cute
and did cute peace signs.
Well it's so funny, because they try
and sneak pictures of us.
And so I see 'em doing
it, and I'm like nihao,
and so they want to do more.
And then they love it.
And so every time they see us,
they stop to take pictures of us.
That was cute.
That's so funny.
This guy right there.
He's come to us a few times.
That's funny.
Did you get Olivia something?
Yes, these are so cute.
Isn't it funny how we're on this fun trip
but the whole time we cannot
stop thinking about our babies?
Everywhere we go it's like
oh Jackson would love that,
Calvin would love that,
or our kid would be
screaming right now or.
(laughing)
-  There's a smaller
one if you want, anybody?
-  A little to the
left, a little to the left.
Your turn.
(laughing)
(speaking in foreign language)
Today we are going on a hike,
and we're hiking to the very top
of the rice terraces.
And you can see behind us just what kind
of scenery we have
on the trip today, it's just beautiful.
The bus is rockin'.
(laughs) Yeah.
It is a bumpy ride.
Whoa.
Woo!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Woo!
Hard to get a breath.
I am out of breath and we just started.
We are in the village of Ping'an.
They're known for their hair here.
When their hair is covered,
they're not married,
and they don't want to show
their hair to the public.
But when they're married
and they have kids,
they have their hair tied in a knot.
On top.
So you'll see
Uh-huh, just right in front.
So you'll see women,
I was walking ahead of
you, so I missed it.
-  They'll have
knots right here on the hair
if they have kids.
But if they don't,
they'll pull their hair back
Their hair is covered.
-  and it's like under a hat.
Aww.
Yeah, isn't that cool?
And this is where we're hiking to.
-  Wow.
-  All the way up there.
-  Right there.
-  No, oh I thought
you were pointing there.
-  Watch out there's a car!
Shhh.
They said it's about an hour hike up
and an hour hike back down.
So I feel like
We're old ladies.
Come on all the old ladies.
(atmospheric guitar music)
-  Did it turn out good, it's good?
(laughing)
Very good.
Beautiful.
-  Thank you.
They wanted to take pictures with Ellie,
because she has blonde hair.
(laughs)
Okay, all of us, okay.
Hello, hi.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
-  Bye guys.
Bye.
Bye.
(laughing)
What was that?
That was awesome.
That was nice.
I was offended they
didn't want my picture,
because my hair is brown.
-  You've got some blonde.
Blondish.
-  Ish.
We walked by and they
said hi to us earlier,
and they were kind of laughing
and I was like, are they making fun of us?
That's what I thought too.
That's so funny.
That's what I thought.
-  Yeah.
And then they came down,
they're like, we want a picture
of you, beautiful blonde.
Well I first had thought,
they were like will you
take a picture of us,
I was like, yeah of course,
there's a beautiful landscape
and we'll take a picture
of you, maybe you can get a picture of us,
we're all happy,
but they're like no, we want to take
a picture with you, beautiful, beautiful.
(laughing)
So then we got to know then
and now we're best friends.
Yeah.
We shared WeChat and everything.
(laughing)
One more thing I forgot,
so they came to me
afterwards and they're like
is that your girlfriend?
Very pretty, very beautiful.
And I was like, no that's my wife.
And they said, oh wow,
congratulations, very lucky.
Oh.
-  I am,
I am very lucky.
That was sweet of them.
This is fun.
I really have enjoyed meeting people
in that kind of sense,
like talking and saying hi,
but then also having our
lunch and dinner with people
from here, learning
more about your culture
and everything, that's been
really a fun experience too.
Vloggers in China.
Hi.
Vloggers in China.
-  Don't get up
there, that's dangerous.
No climbing.
We hiked up
All the way up.
-  This is beautiful.
Like think of how long it took
to terrace all of these hills.
-  Well and how long
it still is taking them.
To harvest, you know?
That's like what all these people do.
This village is just
so beautiful and tiny.
There's no one here,
except Red Bull umbrellas.
(laughs)
Out of any kind of umbrella,
you have Red Bull umbrellas.
That is so funny.
Look at that.
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Hi.
Let's go to English.
-  Did you hear that?
Are you filming?
Yeah.
Did you hear that?
Oh my gosh.
I'm like oh my gosh,
And she goes oh my gosh.
-  That's so cute.
She was so proud of herself.
-  This says that these
are the earliest developed terraces.
Now these have been here,
they took 200 years to do all of these
and they've been here
for more than 700 years.
So these are more than 700
years old, these terraces.
Isn't that crazy?
And they look great.
Like how much maintenance does it take
to keep these terraces
going where they are.
We are winding down,
we've been traveling for
five hours today to get back
Which is why we look so awesome.
(laughs) by the airport
and then we fly out in the morning.
I'm gonna vlog a clip real quick,
so everyone be on your best behavior.
We are in our final hotel room.
All of us are staying
here in this room tonight.
I'm not sure how we're all
gonna fit on this one bed.
All of us spoon to one side--
-  Spoon one side,
and everyone has to rotate like hot dogs.
I claim little spoon.
(Jared laughing)
No we're just hanging
out having dinner here.
This is like our final
hurrah or final goodbye.
Ellie, Bonnie, Joel and
I are leaving tomorrow
and these guys are continuing.
Oh T, you're leaving tomorrow too.
And these guys are hanging
out a little bit later
with China.
It's going to be insane.
Yeah, it's gonna be crazy.
So but that's it, that's China.
We did it.
We had a blast, we worked hard,
we had fun.
Woo!
Give it up.
You guys did great.
Thank you guys.
You guys would love China.
Yes thank you.
Like we really need a million thumbs up.
Shishi.
Shishi oh,
ooh yeah.
Thank you guys for watching
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
Bye.
Wait, I never learned how to say goodbye.
Bye bye.
Zai Jian.
Hai Jian.
Perfect.
Zai Jian.
Is that right?
-  Zai Jian.
Zai Jian!
