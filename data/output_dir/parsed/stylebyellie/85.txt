- Holidays certainly
are not stopping guys.
The holidays are not stopping right here.
- Nothing has been like this pregnancy.
You turd.
You didn't need to do that.
-  That's awesome.
Don't you know if you want to run fast,
you've gotta keep those calories up.
You gotta keep eating that
food if you wanna run fast.
(laughing)
- It's the day after Christmas.
It still feels like Christmas
because we are doing the same thing.
We're playing.
The kids have their hot cocoa.
Is that too hot or is it good Cal?
- It's hot cocoa.
-  It's hot cocoa.
And I think our mugs are so cute.
Okay, are you okay with the whipped cream?
Calvin just about went ballistic
when I put whipped cream on his.
(laughing)
- Welcome to the day after Christmas
where it still feels like Christmas
because the action is still happening.
We've got kids playing all over the place.
Ellie, tell me what you're
working on right now.
- I'm working on my hand lettering.
- Ellie is giving herself
like a really hard time
with her hand lettering.
She's doing like this creative cursive.
- It just takes practice.
-  Well that's the thing,
is it does take practice
and I don't want you to
get hard on yourself.
- It actually looks really good.
These are really cute, but it just,
like you could see how inconsistent I am
and that's what's frustrating.
- Oh yeah, it can be frustrating,
but you can't let yourself get down
because it's gonna take a lot of practice.
This is something new to you.
Anyway, so we've got some fun activities
planned for the day.
Ellie's parents called us
yesterday or texted us yesterday,
I can't remember which one,
and they said, hey wanna come up and see
what the kids got for Christmas
and we're bringing our swimming suits.
That only means one of two things.
Either we're running
through the sprinklers today
or we're getting in the hot tub
and the sprinklers
aren't working my friend.
So I think we're getting in the hot tub.
So I have to run to the hot tub store
to get some extra stuff.
It's been awhile since
we've been in the hot tub
so I have to get some things for it
to make sure it's all fine and dandy
for the in laws, 'cause I
can't disappoint the in laws.
Am I right?
Am I right?
While I'm at the hot tub
store they have a machine
that tells you everything you need to do
to your water with the
watering sampling machine.
So I'm gonna grab a little water sample.
They're gonna run it through their program
and tell me exactly what I need to do
to make sure it's all good.
Normally I've been doing a really good job
of keeping the hot tub at a good level,
but since it has been awhile,
I just wanna double check
and get exact details
of what I need to do.
Okay, dip it in.
Oh yes, oh good, water sample.
Perfect water sample.
Seal it up.
Got it.
Perfect specimen of water.
Holidays certainly aren't stopping guys.
The holidays are not stopping right here
because my secret Santa gift came Ellie.
Are you ready for this?
- I'm very happy (mumbles).
- My secret Santa gift came.
Boom, Psych episodes.
All the Halloween episodes on one disc.
Also, boom.
Da, da, da, da.
A Psych T-shirt.
This is a shirt that I'm
actually gonna wear a lot.
I really, really like it.
So thank you Redditgifts
for making this possible
by doing the secret Santa.
Ellie, we participated the
world largest secret Santa
three years in a row.
- You have.
- And you have.
- I started last year.
- That's true, that's true.
- It's been fun (mumbles).
- It has been fun.
- It's fun because it's
a complete stranger
getting you a gift and it's like
they have no idea who you are
and it just makes it fun.
We have fun getting our guys gifts.
It was hard.
- We really, really did.
- Their descriptions, both of ours,
they love to do pot.
Both of our descriptions of the guys.
So I'm like--
- What do you get someone
who likes to smoke pot?
We came up with something.
- We came up with a good gift,
but it was hard 'cause it's like
there's people all over
the world that do this,
so everyone's interests
can be completely opposite
of what yours are.
- Mine was also a musician, so I got them
a really cool capo that
my dad found out about
that lets you change the capo inserts
that fits different kinds of guitars
or even different types of capo tunings.
Like on Christmas we play an A capo,
so it's cut so it only
blocks out three strings
instead of all six, so you can play
like you're playing an A chord
and it just allows you
to play different things.
Anyway, that's not where it ends.
Kesha and June, one of our
IVF couples from Hawaii
sent us a little gift package
and thank you for that.
That is so sweet of you.
Filled with T-shirts and goodies and look.
-  They've been so cute.
- Look at that.
Isn't that cool?
- You wear the shirts
from Hawaii that they send
all the time 'cause they're nice.
- Yes, that's exactly
what I was gonna say.
It's like I wear those Hawaii shirts
all the stinking time.
-  You guys, thanks.
- Oh, look at these Hawaiian treats too.
Thank you.
- Oh, that's so cute.
- Wow.
Does it say Hawaii on the back?
- You turds, you didn't need to do that.
- That's awesome.
- That was so cute.
- Kesha and June, you take us to the moon.
Get it, 'cause it rhythms?
Thank you guys.
- That was so sweet.
-  That is very sweet.
- Our kids are gonna love these.
-  Aw, present patrol, so cool.
- Thank you.
- We read a letter from them
and it was very, very sweet.
And I am so glad.
Oh, my gosh.
That's so cool.
We're gonna have to come visit
these guys you know that.
You already have.
I need to do this.
Maybe I'll take a trip
to Hawaii by myself.
(ding)
-  I'm never gonna hold that down.
- I love our IVF couples
and our new IVF couples
because of their hope,
their perseverance and hope.
- They sent a sweet, sweet letter to us.
- Yes, they did.
So thank you guys for
being a part of our life.
- Alright guys, it's a good thing
that we have a lot of
pens around this house.
I went through one full pen in last night
and this morning.
I think I've been sitting here for hours
going over hand lettering and it's funny
'cause Jennifer, she got
the same book for Christmas
for hand lettering and
so we've been texting
back and forth like our pictures.
You can get on Amazon, Hand Lettering 101.
So I'm done.
These are some of mine
that I've been working on
and she sent me a picture of her birthday,
which hers was so stinking cute.
And so I tried it and it's funny how
bad it looks, but then
when you fill it in,
fill it, I was saying feel.
Sometimes when I talk, I think of comments
and then I have to resay something
so I know it sounds right.
When you fill it in,
when you fill it in,
it looks so much better.
Like I'm impressed with that.
I think that looks beautiful.
But when I first wrote it, it wasn't.
But when you kind of make
it look a little fancy
and pretty it's so nice.
So I've been having a lot of fun with it.
The boys are downstairs
playing a video game
and I'm sitting here
eating chips and salsa.
I didn't tell you guys yesterday,
but on Christmas it hit
me, for like two hours
it wasn't too terrible, I came out of it,
but like being pregnant
I get headaches a lot
and like hormonally I get headaches a lot,
but nothing, nothing has
been like this pregnancy.
Like I have a headache
right now, but it's not bad,
it's just a headache.
But yesterday it was like my
eyes couldn't see the light,
like I was nauseous, I had to lay down,
put the covers over my
head, like shut the blinds.
It was crazy.
So my chiropractor, you know,
it's been like Christmas break or whatnot,
so I wanna call today
and get an appointment,
but holy cow, it's crazy, it's intense.
But I've been having fun doing this.
I love just that I've been
sitting here all day doing this.
Cute, I get to keep practicing.
This book has like it's like hey
now that you did all of
these, let's start again.
So it's like you do it
again, and again, and again
until you get the lettering right.
How was that?
You like it?
(yelling)
Mmm, that good?
(laughing)
-  That's Calvin's favorite spot
this Christmas holiday.
-  That's enough.
Are you getting one for everyone?
Okay.
Go give one to grandma and grandpa.
It didn't work out.
You have to go to (mumbles).
-  That's a good gift.
- Mom and dad are over here.
Hey, you kids.
- Get down boys.
- One more piece and get down.
Seeing all the presents that the kids got.
And we're trying to contain these kids.
- Come in and know me better man.
Enjoy the feast that
has been provided for us
by Bonnie and Joel.
Thank you for bringing dinner tonight.
Is it funny that whenever
you guys come over
it's like, oh yeah, we're
just bringing dinner.
- No 'cause when you,
oh that's really close.
- He won't let us in the door if we don't.
- When you come for lunch,
we expect you to bring lunch.
- We usually bring lunch, yeah,
so it's kinda like same,
same, trade, trade.
We've got everyone over here
and we are eating some (mumbles)
which is a delicious Indian food.
- Take one more bite.
Thank you.
-  Oh yum, that looks great.
Excuse me Mr. Flash.
Don't you know if you want to run fast
you've gotta keep those calories up.
You gotta keep eating that
food if you wanna run fast.
Yeah, that's right, yum.
Now go run fast.
- I can't.
- Oh, you have to eat more, huh?
(growling)
- All of the kids are playing,
but the two worse ones,
Calvin and Lincoln.
What are you doing?
- We're climbing.
- You're climbing my bed.
You naughty babies.
What are you doing?
I'm glad to see you playing and smiling
and not fighting.
You crazies.
- My slippers.
- Your slippers.
Did they come off?
Put 'em on.
Lost my slippers.
- Yesterday and today I spent the time
shoveling off the patio and
a pathway to the hot tub
and part of the patio up here
because we're gonna start a fire.
We got some firewood, we
got some kindling and stuff
that we're making to start a fire
and then we're gonna get in the hot tub.
Sounds pretty nice, pretty fun.
Penny loves the wood.
Okay, there you go.
You just chew on that
piece for a little bit.
Don't get any splinters.
I'm freezing.
That goal here is one match, okay.
And that's what I'm gonna try and do.
We got it set up and I think we can do it,
light it with one match.
Let's give it a go shall we.
You got one?
-  Yeah my butt your face.
(slow upbeat music)
-  I call that successful.
One match ladies and gentlemen.
(slow upbeat music)
Whoa, get the camera out of there.
It's getting hot.
Fire is a blazing.
Steam is a brewing.
Hey guys.
Oh geeze.
Careful, there's shoes here.
- Joel's steal toed (mumbles) down there.
-  Hot tub party.
- Hi, are you gonna get in?
- Yeah, I'm gonna get in.
I just thought if I'm gonna film this,
I'm gonna be dressed and warm before I--
- Sounds awesome.
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the fire.
- You're welcome, it's fun.
This is cool.
Yeah, I can lift that up.
I'll just do a little more work
while you guys are enjoying
yourselves in the hot tub.
No big deal.
- Can you bring out some
licorice and some pop?
- I have Dr. Pepper.
Are you guys okay with that?
- Just up and over.
- Just up and over yeah.
That is fun.
Oh, I love this.
I love this about the hot tub
and the fire pit and everything.
We've got the hot tub just right
so Ellie can get in it too.
And we're gonna go enjoy ourselves.
It's gonna be a fun night guys.
- Oh my gosh, look.
I just touched it so much.
So then when I look in the camera
it's just one big red dot.
- You're making it angry.
- It is angry.
My mom's like you should
put a hot pad on that.
Bye guys.
- Thank you for the party.
- It's good to see you.
I did want to show you guys--
- I'm just going (mumbles).
- Okay, I did want to show you guys.
Sometimes when Calvin and
Lincoln gets together,
they just fight.
-  Sometimes they always fight.
- They always fight.
At their ages they don't wanna share.
Tonight was the cutest thing.
Calvin and Lincoln was playing in our room
and then I caught them in my bathroom.
I'm gonna show you what they were doing.
The boys, they wanted to sleep again
in their sleeping bags on our floor
so I let 'em.
But Lincoln and Calvin were in here.
Our swimming suits are on
the ground 'cause we just
got out of the hot tub,
but can you guys see
all of the Christmas ornaments in here?
They were in here forever
playing and laughing.
They were just like
playing together today.
Good job boys.
(slow upbeat music)
