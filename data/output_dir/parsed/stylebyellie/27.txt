- Alright, it's that time again.
That was incredible.
- That was phenomenal.
-  Look at these pregnant ladies.
- She has a new best friend.
- Wee.
-  You are so cute.
What did Calvin not
want you to say to him?
- He doesn't want me
to say sunshine to him.
-  He didn't like that?
-  No.
-  Good morning Sunshine.
You doing okay?
Should we eat breakfast.
- Yeah.
-  No.
-  No?
What about chocolate milk?
Are you gonna help me get what I need?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
(rock music)
- Wee!
-  You are so cute.
- You too.
-  It is a cold, bitter day.
So nothing like fresh flowers
to brighten our spirits.
I've been on a little kick that every time
I go to the grocery store
I pick up a little bit
of fresh flowers just
because it's so cold outside.
It really does just like brighten our day.
It's just simple and small, but I love it.
(rock music)
- Bye Mom.
- Bye Mom.
- Don't get into my food.
-  Okay.
- Get in my food.
-  Okay.
(upbeat music)
Did you think you wanted help clean
and you're mad that she's not
letting you get more wipes?
Why don't you go play
and then we'll clean up
when we're done okay?
It is that time of day
where it's one o'clock
and the kids have requested a show.
Where I lay in bed and one lays next to me
and the other lays next to me.
Jackson is adamant that
he puts on the show.
We have a little cuddle, snuggle time.
At the play area, Jackson
gathered all of the kids
he was playing with and he goes,
do you guys wanna see my mom?
I laughed out loud.
I don't know why that made me laugh.
I thought it was cute that he was thinking
like I wanna show all my friends my mom.
They're just really cute.
Jackson always finds and makes friends.
Calvin is always so, so good to tag along
and run after then and play.
It's cute.
All of of the kids at the play area
where grabbing the sanitation wipes
and they were wiping down the toys.
None of the kids were playing,
everybody was doing clean up.
The kids loved it and was so entertained.
But Jackson, why were
you sad at the play area?
- I didn't want that
girl to take those wipes
and throw them in the hamburger.
-  In the garbage?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, there was as little girl.
She was like six and she's
like no more wipes to everyone.
But I let the kids each have two wipes
and they both wiped down slides
along with the other kids.
There was tons of other
kids wiping stuff down.
It was kinda cute.
Okay, cuddle time.
Or is this called snuggle
time, what is it called?
- Cuddle.
- Cuddle, you always
love to cuddle me huh?
Get your head in here, there we go.
- Well, today is the day.
It's a very windy day.
My dad and I have driven
down to Salt Lake City, Utah,
and we are at the Tesla store.
Dad, it's time we got you a Tesla.
- Yeah.
-  So which one do you want Dad?
Do you want the red one or the white one?
- Let's get both.
-  Oh, that's a great idea.
Why not both?
We're actually here to test drive a Tesla.
- Feels awesome.
-  You've never
been in a Tesla before.
- No, I've never been in a Tesla before.
-  It's cool huh?
What do you think of that screen?
- I think it's amazing.
Wow.
-  Do you think
Mom would let you get one?
- No.
(laughter)
(techno music)
-  Open it up.
(laughter)
They call it a frunck.
(laughter)
Isn't that cool?
- A lot of horses in there.
(laughter)
- This is where we do it.
Are you ready for this?
And it's in ludacris mode.
Okay, do you have your seat belt on Dad?
- I do.
- Holy crap.
(laughter)
That was awesome.
That was amazing.
Whoa, did you feel that?
- I did.
-  Okay Dad, don't kill us.
- No guarantees.
Actually I don't feel anything.
-  Isn't that weird.
- So bizarre.
-  You're good.
- I need to adjust.
(laughter)
- So my dad has never
driven a Tesla before.
I kind of feel like he's a kid
in a candy store right now.
Everything we do, he starts laughing.
He's about to go into auto pilot.
- You wanna just keep your
hands rested on the wheel,
but you just supervise it.
-  What do you think?
- Gets me way too close.
I feel like I'm riding the left lane.
But now I feel comfortable.
I think Mom would really like this.
-  You think so?
- I think so.
-  Yeah, I think she'd like it.
Do you think she'd like this
or her red Mercedes Coupe
that she's been wanting
since she was a kid.
- I think if we got a red Tesla,
I think she would forgive me.
-  Go for it Dad.
(laughter)
- I'm afraid what I would
do with a car like this.
-  I think you only went up to 45.
- I know but did you feel those Gs?
-  That was awesome.
So what'd you think Mr. Tesla?
- Oh wow!
-  We drove the model SP100D.
Looks great.
- I'm definitely a convert.
-  Oh good, I've converted you.
Oh man.
Now we're back in this rink-a-dink car.
I'm spoiled now that we
have that test drive.
That was incredible.
- That was phenomenal.
- Oh my goodness.
I have to put my key in the ignition.
I have to shift.
The engine has to turn on.
I converted Dad though.
- Absolutely.
- So sorry Mom, Dad wants a Tesla
and it's all my fault.
- There's a Tesla in my future.
(laughter)
- Hey, I'm hungry.
Why don't we go to lunch, my treat?
- Awesome.
- I get to pick though.
McDonald's it is.
- You're a good singer.
I like singing with you.
- I love singing with you.
(epic music)
-  Whoa!
Are you gonna stomp it out?
Wahoo!
We listen to this
soundtrack every single day
and no one is sick of it.
The Greatest Showman, if you
haven't seen it, go watch it.
Did you want that kiss song?
-  Don't you want that kiss song?
- Don't like that kiss song.
- Kiss my lips.
- You're a good dancer Calvin.
My turn.
(laughter)
He gets jealous of you.
- Alright, it's that time again.
It's Fondue Friday, wait it's Thursday.
It's Fondue Thursday.
- _ need to ask for the recipe.
I was like, I'm not giving it to you
'cause you're gonna invite,
she has a new best friend.
I was like, you're gonna invite them over.
She's like, no I won't.
I was like, 'cause I'm just being jealous.
I was like, you guys can all
come over here for fondue.
- Yeah, but not her friends.
- She's like I really feel like you're not
gonna give me the fondue recipe.
I was like, yeah, I'm not.
- No, we're not.
It's actually a really
great cheese fondue recipe.
_, I really don't know how
to pronounce it and Swiss.
- It's better than the Melting Pot,
it's better than the
expensive meal that we,
and it's so expensive.
- We know that means it's good.
This is boiling, we don't want it to boil.
We just want a little
simmer, simmer down now.
So I'm gonna add the cheese.
What else have we got, we've got chocolate
and we've got some good dipping stuff.
- Pineapple and strawberries
and chocolate dipping sauce.
-  Okay cheese,
let's simmer down now.
(upbeat music)
Now that the kids are downstairs,
now that we're done with the cheese,
it's time to bust out the chocolate.
I have to be really quiet when I say that.
- This is more fun when
the kids are asleep.
-  Everyone enjoy.
Look at these pregnant ladies.
- We've gotta get a picture.
-  Who's further
along, you are Jen right?
When's your due date?
- May 30th.
-  May 30th.
So that's what it is.
So Matt's wife, Emily, is end of April,
Jen is end of May, Ellie's end of June.
That's gonna be a crazy summer.
Well Penny, it's that time of night
where we say goodbye to our friends
after a wonderful day of spending time
with friends and family,
eating delicious food,
experiencing life to its fullest.
That's what you've been
doing, I know that.
Yes, oh is that the spot today?
Found it, yep, got it.
You're such a good girl.
I wanted to thank you
guys for taking the time
and watching this video today.
Although Ellie and I spent most of the day
apart from each other,
we wrapped up the day
with each other with our
family and that was fun
to have dinner with my family,
having a new meal, it was great.
Thanks again for being with us today
and we'll see you guys next time, bye.
