- I'm coming, wanna show me?
Jackson saw a dollar today and wanted it,
and I said well if you can
make your bed on your own.
You didn't make it.
-  But I did a little.
-  No you've done
a lot better job before.
You did a good job but
it needs to be made more.
- But I want help.
-  I'm happy to help but
I'm gonna watch you make it.
- This zipper's too strong.
-  Don't grab the
zipper just grab the bed
and pull all the way
and make it look nice.
Super spider jump?
See now it'll be easier to zip.
Now try and zip this.
See how much easier that is?
Perfect.
And it doesn't have to be
all the way zipped either.
That looks good.
Good job.
-  I'm gonna go tell dad.
- Before we get too far in today's vlog,
I want to give some clarification
of the IVF grant announcement.
We will be picking the IVF grant winners
on Friday the 22nd
and that announcement video
will go up on the 23rd.
I've seen some people ask some questions
about that with the terms
and conditions and everything
and I just wanted to
give some clarification
so you guys are aware when everything
is going to be happening live
on the YouTube channel too.
So picking on the 22nd,
announcing on the 23rd.
We announced the contest
on Saturday the 9th,
we ended the application
process on Saturday the 16th,
and the announcement will
be on Saturday the 23rd.
Now let's build some gingerbread houses.
-  We are getting ready.
We're making gingerbread houses!
Are these gonna be your sprinkles?
- No.
-  No?
-  Good, next one.
Squeeze squeeze good job.
Good squeeze, look at that perfection,
that alignment it's amazing,
it's perfect great job bud.
-  Building gingerbread houses
take a long time huh Jacks?
- Oh we did the wrong side.
We gotta do this side, not that side.
-  Jackson helped
us put frosting there
but we had to let it dry
and now we're putting it together
and then after church
we'll decorate it huh?
- This is all just about
creating a solid foundation.
You know you have to
have a solid foundation
when you build your gingerbread house.
-  Just like with
life in general, huh?
It helps.
- Ready to help me again?
Okay you squeeze.
Oh my goodness gracious Jackson,
you should be a surgeon.
- Oh my gosh.
Alright today's been a little,
are you laughing at my legs?
-  Yes I just saw you walk by.
This is how I saw you walk by.
You had the camera and you were like.
- A few weeks ago I ordered
some thigh-high nylons,
because it hurts my stomach to wear nylons
and I like to wear nylons
in the winter to church
because I think it looks good.
And I ordered thigh-high
nylons from Amazon,
they were like 12 bucks, 13 bucks.
I wore them once.
I'm out of breath.
I wore them once and
this is what I look like.
Hello, wardrobe malfunction!
I just got back from a meeting
I was like yeah, this doesn't work.
This don't work Ellie.
Yeah one week with those bad boys,
I am so unbelievably sad.
So what I'm gonna do it
grab a pair of nylons,
it's when I've had this bag
that I've always had my nylons in
since Jared and I got married.
And it's just been my nylons
where I just like throw.
I know I have some special
ones that I'm thinking of.
Yeah these.
Oh I don't know if that'd be cute,
we'll see, we'll see.
But I am gonna cut the sides
of them so they're not tight.
I just cut the tops pretty much off
so they'll at least stay above my butt
but not cut into my belly.
There we go I'm gonna try these.
Boo hoo!
But happy that I'm 12 weeks,
and I'm feeling really good today.
I don't have like a crazy
huge bump but it's there.
Hi little guy.
Saving grace, these nylons for some reason
aren't like your typical nylons
because they're mesh and have holes in it.
So it's not tight so I
don't need to cut them.
I know they have maternity
nylons that I'll probably get.
I remember wearing them with Jackson.
I think this is actually cuter
because of the texture the nylons have.
There's kind of like little holes in them.
So this is what I'm wearing,
I'm so out of breath.
Okay so I really feel
fancy today for church.
I got this dress last year from J. Crew
and I got it for Christmas last year
and I got this vest last
year from Madewell I believe.
And then I got the shoes
about three years ago
from Nordstroms.
And I wear these shoes just
like four or five times a year,
around Christmas.
Hi, you're gonna bring Kelly to church?
He named the lamb Kelly.
So yeah I always feel
fancy when I wear them
because they're like my special
Christmas holiday shoes.
So this is my outfit for church.
I feel very pretty but
I'm very out of breath
and I'm glad I got those nylons situated.
That would've been embarrassing,
having them fall down
in the middle of church.
- You ready?
You ready for this one?
Oh it's like your favorite.
Okay one, two, three.
(laughs)
I have literally slipped like four times,
and it's not even slippery,
like it's just kind of wet a little bit.
All of the snow's right there.
But my shoes are so
slippery, my church shoes.
We just got back from church,
Penny and I have been playing
outside for a little bit.
And they boys are anxiously
awaiting to decorate.
You guys ready to rock
and roll this Paw Patrol?
Oh Jackson, yours is looking so good.
Gonna outline it with some blue?
Nice.
Calvin we need to get some
frosting on top of yours,
that we you can decorate up here.
Should we do that?
Okay.
- Three hours is not okay
to leave me without food.
- Ellie is literally
scrambling as fast as she can
to get something to eat after church.
- I may have just been very dramatic
and said my life is ruined.
I said and I instantly was
like I shouldn't say that.
- We didn't have any limes so Ellie's like
my life is ruined.
- I am so hungry I'm gonna get pissed.
- Hangry is coming your
way, the hangriness.
Hey boys just a word of
advice for your future wives
and girlfriends and all of that,
just as long as you make sure
your lady friends aren't
hangry, you're golden.
That's like half the battle
is keeping them not hangry right?
Uh huh.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Holy purple mountain
majesty, look at that sunset.
That's amazing.
Hi Penny girl, you ready to get going?
Should we go?
Come on, let's go.
That sky was amazing, it was
lit up like the 4th of July,
it was like the sky was on fire,
it was incredible, it was amazing.
Oh my goodness gracious.
So the kid's are done decorating,
they're actually downstairs
playing right now,
but I wanted to show you the final results
of our gingerbread houses.
This is Jackson's,
look he's got all the Paw Patrol friends
and even the telescope, the look-out.
So cool.
And then this is Calvin's.
Look I did the blue stuff,
but he did all of the
stuff on top himself.
Isn't that fun?
That's so cute.
Good job boys!
You did your best and you forgot the rest.
I think that's a Paw Patrol reference.
Tonight is extra special,
we're going to a
production of The Messiah,
my dad is in the choir here in Utah
and they're putting on The Messiah.
It's a full orchestra, full
singing and all of that.
But that's probably not
the most interesting part
about this evening,
and I'd like to pass the time
over to my dear wife Ellie,
to explain more.
(laughs)
- I don't wanna talk about it.
I was like should we bring kids,
should I just stay home
put the kids to bed?
And Jared's dad is like
kid's need to be exposed to the music,
bring them and it'll be fun.
Kids might get a little antsy
but I'm glad we're gonna go.
And I said, kids we can go to bed
or we can go listen to grandpa sing.
And of course they wanna
listen to grandpa sing.
- And it's a good opportunity for them
to sit and learn and listen.
- It'll be good though, Christmas music.
The bad news is, we got home from church,
I don't think I can go to
church the rest of my pregnancy.
Because I need to eat every hour.
Even though I brought a
few things to suck on,
it was not enough and I
ate good before we left.
I got home and I ate some dip
and ate a little bit of stuff.
I did like cucumbers and
beans and chips and stuff.
But I legitimately told
Jared, I said I can tell,
we might go to this and
we might leave early
because I might explode.
Like I might go to the
bathroom in my pants.
It's happened before and
it could happen again.
I know that I am not the only person,
and I would not be talking like this
if I was the only person
this ever happened to.
So I'm just gonna be open with you.
Pregnant, stomach's very
upset, we'll see how it goes.
I feel okay right now
but two seconds ago I was like
I think I've gotta go home.
-  It's coming in waves.
Good luck Ellie!
- We'll be good.
-  Well we've
already got one lightweight.
This might actually turn
out really really nice.
There he is, right there.
Did you see him?
He was waving at you.
Isn't this fun?
Oh geez.
Hey dad, I'm excited
to hear you guys sing.
- We're excited to sing.
(laughs)
- Holy cow you guys rocked it.
You were good.
- Did you like that?
- They loved the music.
- Yeah they did there was lots of times
where they were just sitting and staring.
- He thought the Hallelujah
was Captain Underpants
and he laughed.
- Jackson did you like that music?
It was good huh?
- How does the Captain Underpants song go?
-  He laughed so hard.
Last night's midnight
snack was fruit and yogurt
and tonight's snack is ice cream.
- It's like this ice cream
is frozen or something.
-  What was really funny is
tonight I put on my onesie outfit
and it was actually Jared's
and then Jared put on a onesie outfit
and it was actually mine.
I didn't think anything of it
I just thought it's just a big onesie.
- Well it was in my drawer and I put it on
I was like oh my gosh this shrunk.
- You should've seen it,
if I could have filmed it I would have,
but it was way too inappropriate.
It was hilarious.
But it's midnight and Jared and I
are going over the IVF applications,
and it's been very emotional.
Took a break, Jackson
woke up a little bit.
Now we're gonna get back and eat a snack.
That is our vlog for the day guys,
thank you so much for watching.
This has been an amazing week.
Thanks for all of your loving comments,
especially about our gender reveal.
Baby boy, crazy.
Do you like the name Mason?
- Mason?
It's growing on me.
-  Aw, that's Jacks again.
- That's my cue.
- I just went down.
He has a stuffy nose.
Okay, we'll see you guys, bye.
