- Good morning guys, and Happy
New Year, welcome to 2018,
Ellie
- Excuse me.
- Ellie and I
- Pickin' up.
(laughing)
- Woo, hey, that's my camera.
Ellie and I want to make 2018
our best year ever on YouTube,
in our personal lives and
everywhere in between.
But we need your help.
We want to ask you about everything.
We have questions for you and so
in the description down
below, I have a survey
that it would mean everything to us
if you would take just a couple minutes
of your time and fill out.
They're questions about
the children's book,
questions about what we film on YouTube,
questions about what you
would like to see more of,
less of, something that
you've never seen before.
We want you guys to take
just a couple minutes
of your time and fill that survey out
so we know how we can make 2018
the best for you and for us.
Because when we work together,
we make some amazing things happen.
And I'm really excited for
2018 because it is going
to be a great year in
so many different ways.
So like I said if you wouldn't
mind doing this for me
and for Ellie and for the kids
and for YouTube and all of that.
Check out the link in the description,
it's a Google survey, you
just type in the information,
then answer the questions
and then it's all set to go,
Ellie and I look at all of that
and then we are gonna make decision
on how 2018 goes based on
what you guys have told us.
So thank you in advance, we
appreciate this so very much,
we are grateful for you guys
every single day, from 2014,
when we started this to 2018
we're still going strong.
Thank you guys, so much, I appreciate you
and now to the, pregnancy update.
- So it has been a minute
since I did a update with you guys.
I talk, I try and talk in the blog,
openly how I'm feeling,
day to day with pregnancy
but I do like to sit down
and talk about everything
that's been going on.
The last time I updated
you guys I was 11 weeks
and I did a cute little
artsy way of updating you,
and to be honest my kids
are not having it today,
and I didn't have it in me,
so I'm gonna sit down and
just talk with you guys.
I am 14 weeks along right now.
And the baby is the size of a peach
and I've been using the app The Bump
and I downloaded a ton of
apps for my last pregnancy
and I was kind of going through seeing
which one was my favorite and
this was by far my favorite.
And when I deleted it, it
was honestly more emotional
than I thought it would
be deleting the app,
because it was like I finally found an app
that I really liked and
then I had to delete it
'cause I miscarried and I
didn't want to see any updates,
so I am happy to have it back.
Try not to get emotional.
But I'm 14 weeks and it just talks
about the baby's sucking his thumb now
and the baby's wiggling,
the baby's kidneys are
starting to do its job.
It just talks all about how
the baby is doing at 14 weeks.
And this is Jackson's
favorite part of the app,
it shows how big the baby
is, so I click on the baby
and it's kind of like a 3D version
that you can rotate the baby around,
you can see his toes, and see his eyes
and just how the baby has been forming
and so it's been really fun,
not just for me to have this app,
but for me to just lay down
and Jackson to say let's
see what the baby looks like
and we go through and look at that.
So that is the app and it
has like questions too,
where it what most people ask at 14 weeks,
and so a lot of those
questions I have wondered.
Like how to get rid of headaches,
how to do this, how to do that.
And it answers questions.
So that's why I have liked the app.
But Jarrod and I's genetic
test came back for the baby,
we did genetic testing this time around
because I did have two miscarriages
and I thought if I were to happen
to have another miscarriage
I'd want to have
as much information as possible to see
if anything is going on with the baby.
And the genetic testing
all came back A-Okay,
everything looks great.
The baby, we also found out the gender,
we are having a boy, you guys know that,
but we are so thrilled to
have three boys in our house.
I can't, I can't smack
the smile off my face
but I also can't believe
that Ellie is having three boys it's just,
it just makes me laugh.
It's fun.
My cravings this last week
has completely leveled out.
I'm happy to eat whatever,
I still kind of don't like sugary foods,
like if I eat it I feel like crap
so I have been sticking
to more rice, and beans
and salads and I do like
cereals, I like bread a lot.
But the one craving that
has stuck around is eggs,
and not just any eggs, boiled eggs.
I really like boiled eggs,
every morning I have
boiled eggs, some avocado,
salt and pepper on there
and it seriously is amazing.
I'm not one to drink lots of
water, I really like Gatorade,
I like juices, but I have
been drinking plain water
with ice and normally I
like my water just nice
and almost lukewarm, 'cause
I think it hurts my teeth
and stuff, but I like
it as cold as it can be
and I drink a lot of
water which is awesome.
The hardest thing from the
beginning of the pregnancy
until now is my headaches have been
by far the worst I have ever had.
And I was almost tempted to
go get that piercing where
it helps your migraines, I
think it's called the Dayarth,
or something, I don't
know what it's called.
It starts with a D.
Yeah I was really tempted to do that.
My brother-in-law is awesome
and he is worked on me
and helped me get everything back in place
and he's done that three
times and then the last four
or five days I've had a headache straight,
Christmas I was out for
a few hours with like,
I couldn't look at the light,
it was so unbelievably bad,
and so today I called in
and I got to a chiropractor
and right this second I feel really good.
And I am so grateful
that she had an opening,
but I went to the chiropractor
and just worked me up,
lots of cracks, lots of positionings,
lots of putting my bones
and muscles back in place
and I feel so much better.
So that is something that I'm going
to be doing once a week
is going to a chiropractor
and so I can just keep things aligned.
It's the weirdest thing,
I would move my neck
and you could hear it cracking.
But now that I move my neck
you don't hear anything
at all because everything's back in place.
It was the craziest thing.
I went to twitter because you
guys have lots of question
and I'm not always able to
always answer all of them.
So I asked you guys what questions you had
and I said but don't talk about baby names
because I try to keep
you guys updated already,
the baby name we are thinking of is Mason,
we haven't had any other baby
names that have come to mind,
but we also haven't thought
of other baby names.
But we're going on a
road trick tomorrow so,
we are going to be picking
a baby name for sure.
I'm gonna try and go
down the list pretty fast
so I can answer as many of your
guys questions as possible.
Is there anything you wish
you would do differently
when the baby is born that you didn't do
with Jackson and Calvin.
Not that I can think of right now,
but something that I
want to do differently
with the pregnancy that I didn't do
with Jackson and Calvin is I've
never had maternity photos.
And in my thinking is, I
always take 100 photos anyway,
I don't need to go get maternity photos,
'cause I always take
pictures of my belly anyway,
but I think that is
something that I want to do
with this pregnancy is do an
actual maternity photo shoot.
I don't regret not doing
it with the others,
but I think I would like to
at least have some photos
of me professionally done being pregnant.
How have you found this pregnancy compared
to Jackson and Calvin's pregnancies.
I would say I was definitely
sicker in the beginning,
with Jackson and Calvin I
didn't have multiple days
of me just laying in bed, being
like, I'm done for the day.
So I would definitely say
this pregnancy has already
been just a little harder.
But it hasn't wiped me out completely
where it's like I'm not even functionable.
I mean there are some people
that have really hard pregnancies
and I'm really grateful
that mine haven't been.
I would say the headaches,
have been the absolute worst though.
How do you think Calvin will
adjust to being a big brother.
I think that Calvin is very loving
and I think that he is
going to adjust well
with a baby brother.
I won't be surprised if at
first it takes him a minute
to warm to a baby though.
I think that's not going to surprise me.
I feel like overall he's gonna
be a very loving brother though.
Animal of choice for baby?
That is so funny.
I don't have one yet.
I think when we have the name
for the baby the animal might come sooner.
I've never really planned
this, but Jackson,
it was like the animal
for him was giraffes
and with this baby I don't know
what his little animal will
be that Mom decides for him
but I need to think of one.
I need to feel it out.
Does this pregnancy feel different
to how you've carried Jackson and Calvin,
if so what's different?
It's crazy how fast you
feel things that I used
to feel when I was like 20 weeks.
28 weeks, like further along.
Like my back, I can feel
that my back is hurting,
I can feel that my hips have been hurting.
For a few days straight
I was a little worried
because my stomach was cramping so much,
and I kept thinking I
just want to play it low,
I just want to get off my feet
because I was honestly worried,
because I was just so crampy,
but I feel really good now
and I just had a lot of ligament pain,
a lot of my stomach grew a
lot between 12 and 14 weeks
and I feel like I was just
going through a growth spurt.
And I could just feel all of those pains.
So I definitely have
felt a lot more early on,
I definitely have a harder
time with acne right now.
I've had a hard time getting rid of it
I feel like I look okay,
I'm ready for the day,
I've got some makeup on,
but I do have a lot redness,
hormonal redness going on.
When are you going to move
Calvin's room to downstairs
and set up the nursery.
Probably in the spring, we'll
probably get through January,
February and then that
will give us like a boost
for the spring to set up rooms.
So that's going to be really fun.
Do you have any smell aversions.
No the hardest time with the smells was
when I was very first
pregnant and I was in China.
That was the hardest 'cause
there was just lots of smoke,
lots of different smells like animal meat,
when I went into the restaurants.
It was just really different from home,
so that was probably my hardest
time with smell aversions.
What are things you take
and considering when choosing a baby name.
I like to name all of the kids
and then end with the
baby name I'm considering.
Just so I feel like it flows well.
I really like how my family
flows, like all the names.
I like how Jackson and Calvin flow,
so I definitely like
the flow of the names.
I definitely don't think it has to start
with a certain letter or
end with a certain letter.
Just as long as it sounds
nice with the other names.
How are you feeling with the
age gap between the boys.
Do you wish Jackson and Calvin were older,
do you feel like it's going
to be a good experience
for both to have a little brother
'cause the differences will
be a little more evident.
We definitely planned on
the age gap it is now,
I mean we wanted a baby a little sooner,
you know that's why tried a lot sooner,
but I think the gap is perfect.
We kind of, Jarrod and I
always had talked about hoping
to have a baby when
Calvin was around three
and that will be the case.
And so I'm really happy with the age gap,
I love that Jackson and
Calvin are so close in age
and this baby will have a three
year gap which is between me
and my sister Julie,
we're three years apart.
So I think, I think
that that will be good.
I don't know any different,
so I don't really know.
But, I like it.
Back to animals for the kids.
Someone's like Jackson was a giraffe
and Calvin had a turtle.
Calvin totally, like
it was a turtle theme.
But when he was a baby I had
planned on it being elephants,
but it kind of turned into turtles, so,
I do want to throw that out there.
That's funny.
Is there a reason you guys liked Mason
or was it a random name.
Mason was a completely random name,
that's why I'm not
saying it's his name yet
because I feel like Jarrod
and I should go through
some family names and some history names
and just see if any of those settle.
Just as well as Mason.
But I really like Mason too.
So we still want to go
through some more but,
obviously that's still top on my list.
Are you going to be doing a birth vlog.
We are.
Those are some of my
favorite memories is being
in the hospital, and capturing
some of those moments.
So we did a birth vlog of the other two
and we definitely do plan
on doing a birth vlog with this baby.
The one thing that will
be different though is
it won't be posted the next day.
That was really hard for me,
having both of the babies
being in the hospital
and Jarrod was there but
he wasn't really there
'cause he was on his computer
until really late at night editing
and that was really hard on me.
So I think that we'll
definitely have a day
to be with our family and to rest
and to get our first
good night nights rest
and then for sure the
birth vlog will be up.
Have you noticed any personality changes
other than being hangry of course.
To be honest, absolutely, and
it does make me a little sad.
I have been so irritable.
I have been a little cranky,
I've been a little short,
I've really tried not to
but I feel like sometimes
it's like you just can't
even flippin' handle it.
(laughing)
You are just are like, and I
really try and like breathe
and calm down and express my
feelings and express like,
I'm gonna lose it, I
need everyone to help me
or I need this and, but yes, I am,
I think part of it is because
my head has been hurting
and when you don't feel
well, like you guys know,
when you don't feel well it's like,
(moans) just everything you're just upset,
like you just don't feel well.
And so, definitely, I would
say other than being hangry,
I have probably not been the most pleasant
to be around all the time.
Do you agree with that Jarrod?
-  Yeah.
( Jarrod and Elsie laughing)
- What do you think, be honest.
-  If I'm being honest I can,
I can definitely see why
things are frustrating to you,
but that's just a part of the thing
that we have to go through.
I love you no matter what.
- Well you're sweet.
-  And I want
to do everything I can
to make sure you're taken care of.
- Well you're sweet, thanks.
-  I love you.
- This was awesome question,
what is one thing that you used
with the last two pregnancies
that you are using again.
(sighs) Lush.
Lush I've been using you
for years and I love you.
This is a massage bar and if
you look on their website,
you'll see it.
I never know the name of
it but you will see it.
And if you go in, they are so good
to know what you're talking about.
This is for pregnancy and
you use it on your belly,
you rub it and it doesn't
leave the oily or greasy.
And this lasts me the full nine months.
I used one full one with Jackson,
one full one with Calvin,
this one with this baby
and just like every day,
every other day I'll
just rub it on my belly,
two or three times and then
I'll rub it into my belly
and I'll rub it really low
down, like on my hips too,
and it just is really good
to moisturize your stomach.
I've never had any stretchmarks,
I don't want to say
that this didn't make
me get stretch marks,
I think you get 'em or you don't,
but it has been really good
in moisturizing my skin
and especially when you're more like five
to eight months pregnant
and you're really hurting
and you're really sore, sometimes itchy,
when you rub it on you belly,
it's just really cooling
and it just feels good
to be able to rub it
into your belly and it
kind of helps massage
and lift up your belly.
I really liked using that
with the pregnancies.
Do you think it'll be a
big adjustment for Calvin
to take on a big brother
role for the first time.
How do you think he'll cope
with having a new baby in the house.
Jackson's probably thinking,
pshh, this is a piece of cake.
I know I kind of already answered this,
but Calvin, lately
(roaring)
I've been putting a little
bit more expectations
on Calvin and I've been
asking more of Calvin,
I guess you could say.
Even as simple as Calvin,
come throw this away,
Calvin come help me put this away.
'Cause Jackson is always
willing to be helpful
if I ask him to do
something he's fairly good
to listen and do it.
And I've been trying
to put the expectation
on Calvin as well.
Even just little things,
like after he's done
eating his cereal bowls,
come bring that over here.
I mean even though those have
nothing to do with a brother,
I think it has to do with
listening and behaving
and I feel like when the baby comes,
he's gonna be excited when I say,
can you help me find a binky
or can you get the baby a blanket.
I think that kids love to
please and they love to help and
-  And maybe the baby
will love the green blanket.
- Oh and maybe the baby
will have the green blanket.
(laughing)
Overall I do think that
Calvin is going to be really,
I think he'll be really good.
Have you been feeling any movement.
I tweeted, like two weeks
ago, that I was like,
I think I just felt the baby move,
and I probably have felt
the baby move four times
and I know, it has to have been the baby,
it is the best feeling
and it has been so subtle
that's why I've kind of
been a little quiet about it.
But like, the nights
where if I'm just sitting
and it's completely quiet and
I'm completely just sitting,
I will feel a little flutter
and there's been two times
that I've been (gasps)
and I've looked at Jarrod
like that was the baby.
So, I definitely have felt some movement,
but not tons and tons, I
want to start feeling it more
to get even more excited,
but I know that I have
felt the baby a few times.
With the new baby coming and Calvin coming
into your room during the
night have you put much thought
into putting Jackson and Calvin together.
I know I've seen a lot of
people comment to do it.
I have put so
- baby
- much thought into that,
and that is something
that Jarrod and I have to decide.
I've gone back and forth,
I think it's a great idea
if they're together, I can
think of a bajillion reasons
why they should have their separate room.
I've asked Jackson,
Jackson do you want to
share a room with Calvin?
So you want him to sleep in your room?
Or do you want to have your own rooms?
-  I want to have my own room.
- Your own room.
Jackson says he wants his
own room, Calvin says my bed.
My answer right now is
they're probably gonna have
their own room and if
they would like to sleep
in the same room and have
sleepovers on mattresses
or on their sleeping bags, absolutely.
But I think that their probably
all gonna have their own room.
- Well that was quite the
pregnancy update wouldn't you say?
- Yes, I hope I answered a
lot of you guys questions,
I like sitting down and answering them.
- I like sitting down because
that's like a good opportunity
for me to hear everything in detail.
Because when we talk
- Instead of cranky
(laughing)
- No, I mean well that's part of it,
when we talk it's not
as in depth as you were
to be uninterrupted, you know,
well for the most part.
- Kind of.
So the kids were
- Yeah, same thing.
- kind of going crazy.
(laughing)
You know what I mean, so it's
fun for to listen to as well.
- Tomorrow we are going
on a little road trip
for New Years, we're gonna
go see our friends Carl
and Ginger and I told Jarrod, in the car
that is the perfect
opportunity, we're gonna sit
and just like talk about names,
we'll bring that book, where is it?
We'll a book, we have
like some family names.
- Yeah.
- We'll look at, have your
mom send a few family names
and think about, we're excited.
- Yeah we really are excited,
it's the beginning of a
brand new year for us.
And we're really excited about it.
Not just with the baby
but life in general.
I really want to encourage you guys again
to check out the survey that we have
in the description down below.
It's gonna help us out
a lot, to know exactly
what 2018 is going to look like
especially your feedback
is very much appreciated.
So check that out.
- I think that just like
life in general this year,
like I've told Jarrod, with
our job, like with YouTube,
like a lot of times we do get up and go
and you know last year we got
a lot of cool opportunities,
we got to go to do the Care Bear event,
we got to go to Vegas, like
stuff like that is so fun to do
and we will hopefully continue
to have some opportunities
like that to do.
But I am excited for a new year.
Six months,
- Look at that.
six months, we'll be welcoming a new baby.
- Isn't that gonna be crazy.
- Calvin,
- You're gonna have a
brother in six months.
-  Calvin people want to know,
how you're gonna react to not
being a baby of the family.
- Are you a baby?
- Um, no.
- Nope, are you a big boy?
-  No.
-  Wow.
- Are you a big boy?
- Are you a big boy?
-  Calvin.
-  Uh huh.
-  Yeah Jackson.
- Calvin, look at Mum.
(Calvin mumbles
- Are you excited for baby?
- Yes.
- Are you gonna be nice to the baby?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  I'm too.
- You are?
- So as we end our vlog today
we are excited for 2018.
It's gonna bring a lot of new adventures,
we're very excited to
go on those adventures,
but we want your help in helping us.
- Decide what
- Figure some
- of those things out.
(laughing)
Yeah exactly,
so check out the
(crying)
link in the description
- You okay?
- for that survey and from us to you,
we will see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye
- Happy New Year!
- Bye
