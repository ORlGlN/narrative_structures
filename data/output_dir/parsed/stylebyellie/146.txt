-  Go hide the pumpkins.
- Don't tell us where
you're hiding it Jackson.
That's the point of the game.
(laughing)
- You don't need three vacuums,
I'm like no, I do.
- Full size candy bars!
The cat is out of the bag.
And thanks to Jackson, we are going
- If you eat it like Boston,
I will so cry.
(Jared laughs)
-  Good morning boys, how are ya?
You eatin' breakfast at Daddy's feet?
(Jared laughs)
How, that is the cutest thing
in the whole entire world.
Like, that pan down to
these beautiful kids.
Hey Calvin, where are you going,
you're ruining the sweet moment.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
(munching)
(razor buzzing)
-  Mommy Mommy.
- Hey Jackson, I just don't think
you can be any happier
about getting your hair cut.
Oh you think you can?
Okay good, I'm glad you think so.
- We're getting there.
- We are.
Calvin's already done,
and then it's my turn.
You have just been
cruising around on that,
oh crash, cruising and crashing.
I think those little
Strider bikes are so awesome
in helping transition kids from learning
to do like a non-pedal
bike to a pedal bike.
Jackson literally did it on his first try.
Calvin's not there yet,
but he will be pretty soon.
I think by his birthday,
by the time he turns three,
he will be ready to ride a bike,
just like Jackson did.
- It's so fluffy.
- What am I, a stuffed animal.
- You have a lot of it,
it's just really full.
Someone asked the other
day if you were 90.
- Oh because of my gray hair.
- Is he 90?
- Hey, it's experience and wisdom.
I'm happy with my full head of hair.
- Oh you look so ravishing.
- I'm very happy with it.
- Thank you.
- Alright guys, my floors are disgusting.
Ah, you can't even tell.
Okay (laughs).
Bad bad bad angle.
Okay, they really are really dirty,
really sticky, Calvin may
have dropped Gatorade,
he left a trail all over
the house with Gatorade,
so I just, I need a vacuum.
Last night I ended up taking my
So we have two vacuums,
we have a big vacuum,
it's a Dyson, and then we
have a small cordless one
that we usually use
for the hardwood floor,
like daily upkeep.
And I took apart it,
just the hand held one,
and I went in the car and vacuumed it
and it got all the dog hair out
and then I actually
washed the vacuums out,
like I took the filters out,
I rinsed them, I cleaned them, they're dry
and so now my vacuums are clean
and I'm ready to re-clean the floors,
because they are so so dirty.
And I told Jared, I was like we need
I think we need another vacuum
and he literally laughed out loud.
Is this cracked?
No it's not.
He laughed out loud because he was like,
we don't need three vacuums,
and I'm like, no I do,
'cause like I clean them,
we're, I don't know,
I feel like I almost need another,
and that sounds really ridiculous.
But I wouldn't might having a third one.
But I need to clean.
Our house is really sticky and dirty,
and then we can play and have fun today.
For mopping, I actually
have two mops as well,
same thing, one really nice heavy duty one
and then one that is just kind of nice
just to do throughout
the week to maintain.
I got this one on Amazon,
it's like a spin brush one
that I've really enjoyed.
It took me awhile to
find one that I thought
would work for me.
So far I've liked it,
I don't really know what
else to compare it to.
But I'm gonna use this today,
I just fill it with water
and add a little bit of vinegar in it,
and it rings it out really good,
so it doesn't leave
moisture on the ground.
And then throughout the
week I have this one,
it's not a Swiffer, I like Swiffers,
it's like the same thing,
it's a Bona one,
and I just have the Bona
cleaner that I spray
on the wood floor for touch ups.
Why am I, I'm out of breath.
I'm out of breath because I was vacuuming.
I was gonna say I don't
know why I'm out of breath,
but obviously it's because I'm working.
(quirky enchanting music)
- Calvin watch, I'm gonna,
get down, watch.
-  Is Calvin trying to copy you?
- And now like this.
-  Do you remember
that picture of me and you
eating chicken scampi?
- Yes,
I always think about that
- for the first time?
- when we come here.
-  I thought I had
that in our room, but I don't.
- No I don't think we've
ever printed it out,
have we?
- Aww.
-  Well we'll show
you that picture right now.
-  Yeah.
-  But Jared and I for years would
share chicken scampi and
I think after eight years,
it's about time we get our own.
- Get our own (laughs).
-  You've grown up.
-  We're more hungry.
- This is the lunch portion,
we shared the dinner portion.
-  We're out to
lunch with Mom and Dad, hi.
- Hi.
-  And little Cal is asleep.
This is like the best lunch date
is when one of them is asleep,
- When the kids are asleep.
-  because then I
can really enjoy the food.
- You want cheese on yours?
- You want some cheese
-  on your cheese
and pepperoni pizza?
- No.
No.
- Okay.
-  So no thanks.
Jackson ordered pizza
with ketchup and grapes.
- And I think that's weird at first
but then I realize that
the sauce is tomato sauce,
so is it really that
weird to have ketchup as
-  He really wanted ketchup.
-  What are you gonna show me?
- A pumpkin.
-  Okay let's see it.
-  Now turn it around,
show him the other face.
He drew.
-  Oh that tiny little
That (laughing)
- It's a sad face.
- Hi.
- Okay, are you guys
ready to play the game?
- I'm gonna hide it.
- Okay.
- We're gonna play.
- The kids love doing stuff like this
and it's fun for us.
We are gonna play, hide and seek pumpkin.
-  Bum bum ba!
- Okay, you go hide if first really good
and then Calvin will come find it.
- Don't tell us where
you're hiding it Jackson,
that's the point of the game.
Did you hear it?
- I heard it.
- Oh man.
- Okay, we'll come find it.
- So we literally have been
doing boring adult things
for the past couple hours
and the kids have been so good,
so we are just focusing
all of our attention
and energy on having fun
with the kids right now.
Don't tell us where it is Jackson.
(laughing)
Okay, let's see if Calvin can find it.
Where is it?
He's so proud about him hiding it.
Oh he just put his there too.
Okay here's the deal boys.
Okay now it's Daddy's turn.
I'm gonna draw a face on a pumpkin
and you have to find the pumpkin
and you have to tell me
who's face it is, okay?
So I'm probably gonna need
a couple minutes, right?
Maybe you'll do another round
while I draw a face, okay?
I'm gonna need a couple minutes alright?
Oh bum bum.
- Okay.
-  It's so blurry.
Ellie, your bum is so blurry.
There we go.
- Go hide 'em.
Go hide the pumpkins.
(Jared laughing)
-  Okay.
-  There's the place
that I was looking for.
- Go hide 'em.
-  Okay, show 'em, wait wait.
Now put 'em here.
There we go.
- While we are waiting for Jared
to hide the pumpkins,
we want to tell you something.
- I'm Captain America.
- I'm Hulk.
- You're Hulk?
(laughing)
Okay okay, let me tell them something.
So I bought pants for Jackson and Calvin
a few weeks ago.
- We're playing hide the pumpkin.
- We are, we're waiting
for Daddy to hide it.
And the pants
for both the kids
- No, where's Dad?
- Yeah, Dad's hiding it.
- Oh.
- And I got the kids' pants
and they were both way too big on them.
- No no no!
- And I was gonna return
them and life got busy
and I thought I'd hold
onto them for a minute.
Both the kids had a crazy growth spurt.
They totally fit Jackson in these ones,
did not even fit close to Calvin
a few weeks ago.
I mean they're still just a hair big,
but I feel like they fit him
and especially come two
months into December,
they'll really fit better,
but they look good.
I can't believe how fast they're growing.
-  Calvin, I hid it,
come upstairs and find it.
Whoa!
Jackson I hid it, come
upstairs and find it.
That could've been really bad.
Okay, you gotta find it
and you gotta guess who's
on the pumpkin, okay?
- Okay.
Where is it?
What?
- Do you see it?
Was that too easy?
-  That was cuter than heck.
-  Okay, go find it.
- Sponge Bob.
- Oh that was so fast.
Oh my gosh, you're so good,
you told from all the way over here.
Who is it?
- It's too high for me.
-  Penny.
- Do you want to hide it next?
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.
- I'm gonna hide it under
- Okay, you don't tell us
where you're hiding it.
- Okay.
- I think I'm gonna hide it.
-  Don't tell us where.
- No shh shh okay, don't
tell us, just go hide it.
Come here Cal, Cal
-  What are you
gonna draw on this one?
- A happy face.
-  Okay, first you do a sad face,
now you're doing a happy face.
There's the eye.
Good job, there's another eye.
That's so good, okay, are
you gonna hide it now?
- You know what, we need to
set up those ghosts tonight.
-  Yes we do.
- Do you think the kids
want to do that after this?
-  Oh I'm sure they do,
that would be so much fun.
Here's your job, you gotta go hide it,
but you can't tell us where you're gonna
hide it okay?
That's the point, that's
for us to find, alright?
- I'm gonna go super fast and hide it
with my glove, my Spider glove.
- Spiderman glove.
- Awesome.
-  Come find it!
-  Okay are you guys ready?
Penny's ready too, let's go.
Okay Penny, sniff it out.
-  Okay Calvin go find the pumpkin.
-  That's not the right way.
-  Jackson, don't walk to it,
let Calvin find it.
-  Do you see it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay let's go get it.
Can you get it?
It's your turn to hide it.
Let's go hide it for Jackson, okay?
Let's go and then we'll see
if he can find it, let's go.
Go go go go, where should we hide it?
- That one.
-  Okay.
- Bed.
-  Oh in his bed?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's be so quiet.
Oh yeah, how about in the teepee?
Oh under the bed?
-  Yeah.
- Okay, there you go.
Let's go. Tell him it's ready.
(Calvin vocalizes)
- Okay let's go.
- Okay I'm gonna go find it.
- No, mine!
(laughing)
- They're still learning
the point of the game.
- No mine.
-  I think he'll find it.
No, you're good, you're good.
- Keep going.
- Keep going.
- Shut up Mom and Dad.
-  Where's Calvin?
Shoot (laughs).
He was looking over here.
I bet you anything Calvin's gonna come out
with it in his hands.
- I thought he was right
there, when we came down.
(yelling)
- Oh he did.
You kids, you kids.
- Okay Mama's turn.
- Mama's turn to find it.
- And you guys close your eyes.
(yells)
Not one of those.
-  Ooh Mom's
throwing out the tricks.
- Where did it go?
-  Where did it go?
We gotta find it.
- Where did it go?
I have no idea where it is.
- Look in and under and
(Jared gasps)
- Calvin found it, yay!
- Calvin found it!
- That was nice of you to give that.
- Yeah, I'm gonna hide it now.
- That was fun.
- Okay.
-  Oh no, oh no, oh no!
Not the ghosts!
What's that?
I may have three very large ghosts
to put in the front yard
and that it is baby, three.
Okay, let's go put it in the front yard.
Jared has not seen these yet.
Woooo.
- Woooo.
-  What do you think?
- They're cool.
- I've had 'em
- I thought they were
- air ones, like blow up ones,
but you stick 'em in the ground, huh?
-  Yeah, it's just
like those little ones.
- That's so cool.
-  Look at that sunset.
Oh my goodness.
-  Ooh wee ooh,
we got some very spooky ghosts.
- Ooh wee ooh.
(Jared laughs)
-  It is so windy today.
Look how cool that looks
with the wind boys.
Does that look awesome Calvin?
- That looks cool.
-  Yeah.
Guess what?
Tomorrow is
- Halloween.
-  It's Halloween.
And you know what you're gonna do?
You're gonna wake up,
you're gonna put your costume on,
if you don't already have it on
and you are gonna go to school
and you're gonna have a Halloween party.
- Yeah.
-  Are you so excited?
- Yeah, like you.
- It's excited too.
See?
This is my excited face.
Show me your excited face.
But then after that,
we're gonna come home,
we're gonna do some things at our house
and then our cousins are gonna come over,
we're gonna play.
And we're gonna go around the neighborhood
and trick or treat.
- Yeah.
-  And what do you get
when you say trick or treat
at someone's house?
- Trick or treat, candy.
-  Yeah, trick or treat candy.
And what happens when you wake up
in the morning after Halloween?
What does Mommy and Daddy do?
- Go to China.
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna be gone, huh.
-  Yeah.
- And we've been talking about this a lot.
And you're gonna spent
lots of time with both sets
of grandparents, and
you're gonna see cousins
during that time.
(growls)
You're okay?
- Yeah I'm okay.
- That's a good boy.
- You'll be good for them.
- Yeah.
-  But what do
Mom and Dad usually do
with your candy when you
wake up after Halloween?
- Eat.
- Do we eat it all?
-  Do we eat it all?
- We won't.
-  Is it just a joke?
- If you eat it like
Boston, I will so cry.
(laughing)
- We won't eat it all.
-  We won't eat it, I promise.
- Maybe you can just give us a piece.
-  Can you share a piece with us?
- Yeah.
-  Aw that's so nice of you,
thank you so much.
- I'll give one to you.
-  Oh perfect, thank you.
- And one to you.
- Two?
- One to you and one to you.
- What if I want two?
- Just one.
- That's what I tell you
and you always bargain.
Well I'm three, so can I have three?
- I'm 29 years old,
can I have 29 pieces of candy?
- That's too many.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- Alright, it's time for bed.
- We'll stick with one.
- Give me kisses.
I love you.
- I'm gonna turn
-  Where are you going?
(switch clicks)
- Oh.
- Good job.
-  Good night.
- I was like where are you heading,
come on let's lay down.
- Sleep tight buddy okay.
Well guys the secret is out
and the cat is out of the bag.
- And thanks to Jackson,
we are going to China.
(gasps)
- There you have it.
You guys know the news.
The news is now not new, it's old.
(laughing)
Sit.
Good girl.
-  She's like I'm good at minding.
-  But I'm gonna wag
my tail and act like I can.
- You're not, sorry.
-  Ellie tomorrow is
Halloween, are you so excited?
- I'm excited, Jackson is excited
he has a little party at his pre-school.
- I know, I think that's the funnest part
is seeing through the years
all of the excitement from the kids.
But I'm also excited,
because I'm a freakin' adult.
I'm an adult and I get to choose
what we do for Halloween.
- And I'm gonna eat whatever I want.
-  Yeah.
- Like I do every day of my life.
- I was just gonna say,
so it's a regular day for Ellie.
But I'm excited, we've got some fun candy
and some ghosts in the front yard,
just Halloween and it's our neighborhood,
and so there's gonna be a lot of memories
that we make here for a long long time.
- And Jared just bought
candy bars to pass out.
- I did!
Full size candy bars!
Penny, full size candy bars!
Penny, full size candy bars!
I'm really excited, I've never done that.
But we're gonna be that house.
At least for a little bit,
I didn't buy a ton.
-  You bought a box.
- I bought a box,
so it's like the first few
people that come to our house,
full size candy bars!
Full size candy bars!
- For all the two year old
and three year old toddlers
that go at five o'clock before the rest.
- That's right, that's right.
So we are gonna call it a night,
because we have a big day tomorrow.
Thank you so much for watching.
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.
We're gonna eat some cheesecake
and we'll see you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
