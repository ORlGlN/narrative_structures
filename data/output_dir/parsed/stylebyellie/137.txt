- Let's talk about the marshmallow test.
In the 60s and 70s, there
was the Stanford experiment,
where they would give kids a small reward
and see if they would delay gratification
for something bigger.
So in this situation, I'm
gonna give you one marshmallow,
but if you wait, I'll
give you two marshmallows.
I'm not sure how accurate the results
of this test are,
but I know my siblings have done this.
I'll have links to their videos
in the description down below,
and we wanted to try Jackson
and maybe even Calvin,
just to see what they did
in this specific test.
So we have a marshmallow set up,
we're gonna bring Jackson in first,
and we just thought it'd just
be fun to see what he does.
- What?
- Yeah, that's a marshmallow.
Go sit in that one right there.
So I have a marshmallow here on this plate
for you okay, you can have it.
But, if you wait, and you don't eat it,
I'll come back a little bit later,
and I'll give you something
extra special, okay?
- Are you gonna come later?
- I'll come later, okay?
- Why I am gonna stay in here forever?
- Not forever, just
for a little bit, okay?
You have one marshmallow right here,
but if you wait, and don't eat it,
I'll give you another one,
something bigger, better, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back,
I'll go get it.
- Okay.
Is it another marshmallow?
-  Maybe, we'll see.
- Do do do do do do.
(bright music)
(sneezes)
I love it!
- So I have Jackson set up in
the filming room right now,
with the marshmallow test.
And it's been about a
minute and 30 seconds.
He's just sitting there.
-  Did he want
to eat the marshmallow?
-  He went for it at first, yeah.
- And you said if you wait.
-  And I said if you wait,
you can have something bigger and better.
-  And it's for five minutes, huh?
-  Yeah, something like that.
-  Okay.
-  He's doing so
good, I'm really impressed.
I thought he would demolish it.
(laughing)
-  He's just like gonna take a nap.
-  I know.
I'm mostly surprised he's
just sitting in the chair.
-  It's like he
doesn't want to look at it,
'cause he knows it'll tempt him.
-  I know.
-  Hey, you're smart.
(bright music)
- Ha!
-  Did he said just say Dad?
- Dad!
-  Yeah.
-  How many more
minutes does he have?
-  He's got like two more minutes.
- Awww.
I feel like we all need
to give kids more credit,
because they're just kids.
- Yeah, I mean he's not
even four years old.
- Even if he had ate it,
it's like well I would've done that too.
- Well I think at some point,
I'm not reading into any of these results
from this too much,
but I feel like well, I'm
just gonna eat it now,
because I don't want two, you know?
Because what about that outcome?
So either way
- Because you don't want to?
- You don't want two of them,
you're just like, well
I'm gonna be one and done
and just get out of here.
I don't know,
maybe that tells more about me than
- Our three year old?
- He's doing so good.
- He's closing his eyes.
- Mmm, what a good kid.
- Dad.
- Dad Dad.
(bright music)
Okay, let's see what he does, he's moving.
- Oh.
(laughs)
- He's laying on the chair.
(humming and revving)
He's being a race car.
-  My favorite vroom vroom.
Vroom vroom vroom!
(yell revving)
- So are you supposed to tell him
he'll get bigger and better
or are you supposed to
tell him hell get two?
- It's just a bigger reward.
Most people do two marshmallows,
but the whole point of it is something
that's better than the first one.
- Well you know what we could give him.
- Sure, yeah, that'll work.
- We've had this in our cupboard forever.
- A little Pup Patrol sucker.
Pup Patrol, Pup Patrol.
(bright music)
- Dad!
- He touched it, he touched it.
- Dad?
Dad?
- Okay that's 5:32,
I'm gonna go back down.
Okay, Jackson, how was that?
Was that fun or was that boring?
- Boring.
- It was boring, but guess what?
- What?
- You didn't eat this marshmallow,
you know what that means?
You get another marshmallow
and just because I think
you're the coolest kid
in the world, Pup Patrol.
A little Pup Patrol sucker.
- This is cool.
- Yeah.
Okay now that you've done this,
I have some questions for you, okay?
- Okay.
- Was this hard or was it easy?
- Hard.
- It was hard, huh?
Why didn't you eat the marshmallow?
- Because I didn't.
- You didn't.
Is it because you wanted
to get something bigger?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and so you knew that by waiting,
you'd get something bigger, huh.
- Yeah.
- Do you feel like you got
something better, for waiting?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Yeah, these are pretty cool, huh?
(laughing)
Calvin, don't worry, we'll do
this with you very very soon.
So why did you wait and you
didn't eat this one, why?
- Because I didn't.
- Because you knew
you'd get more than one?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Did you like waiting or was it hard?
- It was hard.
- It was hard?
- Yeah.
- But you did really good, huh?
- It was hard waiting.
- Yeah, it was.
But you did awesome at it, huh?
You were a good boy.
- Good job.
- Pssht.
- Should we
- Ba la la la la.
- Oh let's try it again.
- Ba la la la.
- Ba la la la.
(laughs)
- Chase is gonna do it.
- Okay, let's see.
- Ba la la la.
- Ba la la la.
-  Dun dun dun dun.
- Do you think we should
try this with Calvin?
Do you think Calvin will wait?
Do you think he will?
- Yeah.
- Do you think Calvin
will eat the marshmallow
or do you think he'll
wait for two marshmallows?
- Maybe he will eat it.
- He might, yeah, well should we see?
Let's go ask Calvin to come down here
and we'll try it with him.
Let's go take our marshmallows upstairs.
Okay, come on.
- No no.
- Let's go.
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, can you say hi?
- Hi.
- Calvin's gonna do it now.
- Hi Calvin, welcome to
the marshmallow test.
So here's the deal guys,
I have no expectations
for Calvin whatsoever,
because he's a little young for this test,
at least the way that I think.
But we're gonna try it out
just for kicks and giggles,
just to see what happens.
Calvin is two, he'll be three in May.
So Calvin, here's the deal.
I have one marshmallow.
And you want it really really bad.
But here's the thing,
I can give you one marshmallow
and you can have this
marshmallow, if you want,
but, if you wait and you don't eat it,
I'll go upstairs,
and I'll get you two marshmallows.
- Yeah.
- Okay do you want two marshmallows?
Yeah, don't eat it and I'll give you two.
So I'll be right back,.
And if you wait, I'll bring you two.
Okay?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Okay, I love you.
Give me a kiss.
Okay, I'll be right back
with another one, okay?
(lively music)
(blowing)
Look at him, he's shaking
his arms and saying no.
- Stay.
Don't.
-  I think he's eating it now.
-  Aww.
-  He shook his head no.
-  Aww.
I think he's eating it yep.
- I can't tell if he's eating
-  Yep yep, it's gone.
-  He's eating it.
-  But at least he tried.
- Well did you see him,
he folded his arms and went
-  Aww, he did pretty good,
- Yeah.
-  but didn't quite make it.
-  Calvin?
Calvin, why did you eat it?
-  Hi Cal.
- Hey bud.
-  Did you eat it?
Awww.
- Why did you eat it?
How did you eat it Calvin?
- He's shaking his head.
- Took just a couple little bites.
How cute is that?
My favorite part was
when he folded his arms
and was like no.
- But that was just a
little too hard to resist.
- Calvin do that again.
- Yeah, it was a good marshmallow, huh?
- Border Hound says say no.
Do you want to see this?
(gasps)
Dun dun dun.
- Whoa.
- Well Calvin didn't quite make it.
But I think he's a little young,
but it was cute to watch it anyway.
- We didn't really have
expectations for Calvin,
but Jackson I felt like he's old enough
to do this test.
- It's mine, it's mine.
- Totally.
- It's mine.
- Oh and now we're gonna
- Here Calvin, here's this.
- fight over the toy.
Calvin can finish the marshmallow.
He didn't quite win a prize,
but we're gonna totally gonna
do this again in the future,
and I bet he will win a prize.
- So that is the marshmallow test.
I hope you guys enjoyed
just seeing the funny
reactions from the kids and what they did.
- Dun dun dun dun.
- Dun dun dun dun.
- If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumps up
and we will see you
guys on our next video.
Thank you for watching.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- We want all of our
friends to do this too.
I want to see Ollie, Gaines,
even Boston , I don't know
if Boston's done this.
- I think Boston did it a long time ago,
so I think he's ready for round two.
- If you have a kid around three or four,
even older that's perfect.
So try it and tag us in the video.
- Okay, bye.
- I'm Spiderman.
- Psshht.
- Pssht, pssht pssht.
