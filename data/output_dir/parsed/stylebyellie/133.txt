We're sitting down here
waiting to get on a train,
because, today, we're going--
To Hong Kong!
Hong Kong.
A lot of you guys are like,
"Are you going to Hong Kong".
We are today.
I'm so excited, but, Natalie, hi, girl.
Hello.
Is in the middle of--
I'm so beautiful.
She's in the middle of getting ready.
You do look beautiful, and I was like,
"Where did you get your skirt".
Look at this velvet skirt,
and she got it on Amazon.
I have so many friends, and, my cousin,
she buys all of her clothes on Amazon.
-  You go like
this, and it wiggles.
You look so cute!
You look darling.
I'm gonna have to get my game on
and start shopping on Amazon for clothes.
-  Get your skirt game, girl.
Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Everyone
create a circle of trust,
a circle of safety and love.
He's in the circle of trust.
Okay, good.
Aw, so sweet.
Look at all these people.
Welcome to Hong Kong, Ellie.
You're in the middle.
That means you have to break dance.
Yes! No!
I'll throw a beat.
Don't say no.
I'll throw a beat. You break dance.
-  I don't wanna break dance.
(upbeat music)
(laughs)
Yeah!
I feel like we're sardines in a can.
Traveling is always packed.
-  Yes, it is.
We're trying to get on the bullet train.
Got it.
Goal is to not move while
in the subway when it stops.
You're gonna step.
Mind your step.
I didn't step.
(shouting)
She's got the Matrix!
This is so easy.
"This is so easy," he says.
So easy he couldn't do it.
Are you a kung fu master?
With one foot, he says.
One foot, he says.
Dang it!
(upbeat music)
Do you see that scaffolding?
-  Yes.
-  That's all made from bamboo.
Isn't that cool?
-  That's crazy.
They did the same thing in China,
but we're in Hong Kong right now,
and it's cool to see the difference
between Hong Kong and China.
Hong Kong was under British
rule for like 100 years,
and there's a lot more
Western influence, I think,
and you see more McDonald's
and 7-Elevens and circle K,
and people are driving on
the opposite side of the road
than in the United States, but,
even just across the river,
it's crazy to see the
differences between China
and Hong Kong.
(noise drowns out speech)
What a small world.
We are in Hong Kong, and we
just got to the LDS church.
We went to the bathroom.
We didn't make it in time to
go to the sacrament meeting,
the worship meeting, and Jared
met someone that he knows
from Utah, and he works here now.
Is that not crazy?
And Jase and his friend met someone
that they knew in Hawaii, so
two people that we both met
from different parts of the world.
They're just catching up.
(gentle music)
I'm noticing that the world
is smaller and smaller
every single day.
We are here in Hong Kong, and
a buddy of mine from college,
Scott, lives here, and I had
no idea that you were here.
TFN told me.
I was like, "That name sounds so familiar,
"like why is that so familiar".
He showed me your picture.
I was like, "Oh my gosh, I
went to school with you,"
but Scott is here in Hong Kong.
He's been here for like four years,
and he's been doing some amazing things
that is changing the world of Hong Kong
and the people who come here to work.
Basically, in Hong Kong, there's issues
around forced labor with
migrant workers from
the Philippines and Indonesia.
We've set up a nonprofit employment agency
to help these people find jobs ethically
and kind of prevent the debt
bondage that occurs here.
Yeah, and he's gone
from, in over the course
of two, three years--
-  Three years.
Three years, from placing 90 per year
to like 1,000.
You're on the pace for
like 1,000 per year,
so 1,000 people are getting
out of terrible situations
into safe working environments
and that sort of thing.
Yeah, we're gonna place
about 1,000 people this year,
which is a lot of people
that we're helping,
but we also see opportunity
to help a lot more
over the next couple years.
-  That's so cool, and
what's the nonprofit called?
The Fair Employment Agency.
That's so cool, man.
How cool is it?
Like, a friend of mine
from college is doing this,
changing so many people's lives.
Awesome, dude.
That's so cool.
(gentle music)
(moves into pleasant music)
(record scratching)
Well, that was funny.
We all took a picture on
the stairs over there,
and all of these girls from
Hong Kong, I'm guessing--
They were, like, they were laughing,
and they were pointing
at Jared the whole time
we were all taking a group picture.
Well, yeah, 'cause we
were waiting to get down,
because we didn't know if
the picture was being taken--
He was being goofy.
I was doing some poses here and there,
and they're all just laughing,
and then the mom comes up
to me and was like, "'Scuse me.
"You take picture with these girls".
-  It was so cute.
-  It was so funny.
They all--
-  I stood back and filmed.
I'm like, "You want me in it".
No, okay, just Jared.
My first thought was, like, "Oh, good.
"They watch our Youtube
channel," but, nope,
they just liked me for my personality.
It was so cute.
Do you ever get the feeling that our wives
like each other better than they like us?
-  It's confirmed.
I just think they like spending more time
with themselves than they do us.
If they didn't need us,
they wouldn't have us.
Probably not.
That's where you come in, though.
I get a lot from you.
Thanks for saying that, Joel.
I needed to hear that.
Bros.
Before--
-  Clothes?
Wives.
I think something that's been
interesting that is cool--
And then you hold it up to
your eye, and you're like--
Is the money here.
Then, your eye looks really fancy.
It's like every time we
get money in Hong Kong,
it's different than in China,
and it's just very fancy.
It feels cool, but that's 10.
What does that mean here?
It's 10 here, but what
does it mean in the U.S.?
You divide it by nine,
so it's like a dollar.
Divide it by eight.
It's like a dollar.
-  Cool. I like it.
It feels weird, huh?
-  Yeah.
I wonder--
-  Doesn't.
Doesn't tear.
-  Good.
That's crazy.
These don't tear.
Maybe the U.S. should
upgrade their dollars.
(heavily accented speech)
Okay, okay good.
Our next stop of the day
is at the Chi Lin Nunnery.
This is a temple which
is very sacred to them,
and we are going to walk through,
and we're going to be very respectful,
but it's just absolutely beautiful.
I'm not sure exactly what we can
take pictures of and everything.
Like I said, we wanna be respectful
of what they hold scared,
and we are going to go
through and admire the beauty
and the history of the Chi Lin Nunnery.
(gentle music)
This has been a very peaceful Sunday,
and this is a very peaceful, sacred place,
and it's beautiful to be here.
This is amazing.
This is behind--
The trees are just like the bonsai trees.
Is that what they call they call 'em?
-  Yeah, no, they're banyan trees.
I'm gonna say that wrong
if I try and say what they are called,
but they're beautiful.
I love being here with you.
This is like the coolest thing ever.
This has been a really good day.
(gentle music)
All day, I kept thinking
about our relationship Q&A
and thinking, "I don't
know if I wanna post it".
I feel a little nervous to post it,
because, the more I've been here,
I've never been out of the country,
especially like this.
What works for one person
does not work for another.
May not, yeah.
Yeah.
And I have loved seeing the culture here
and how other people do things, you know?
It's a unique experience
being able to live life
somewhere else, and we've
only been here for a few days,
but you get to see life
through someone else's eyes
for a minute, and, like we
said in the relationship Q&A,
things may not work for
you like they do for us,
but it's the principle--
I just keep reflecting on that.
I think Jared and I are
able to understand more
of comments that have
come in that are different
for them to see in our life.
Things that are the norm where we live
is not the norm where a lot of you live,
and our demographic is so large,
and I think that it's nice
to get out of our space--
Our bubble.
Into another and open our eyes more,
and it's been amazing to be here,
and it's been amazing to hear the culture.
That's always been a goal of mine--
Emotional.
Yeah, it's always been a
goal of mine to take myself
out of my shoes and to see
perspective from all around.
And you're very good at that.
And being out of the country,
a very different country
at that, has been just a
really great opportunity
to do just that.
Was that a bird poop or rain?
I think it was a bird poop.
Yep, right there.
That's the bird right there.
(laughs)
-  Did you hear it?
Where is he?
Right there.
That was hilarious.
Right there.
I see him right there.
-  Yeah, right there.
-  That was hilarious.
Well, we almost got pooped on by a bird.
Yeah, I totally heard that.
Well, and even talking,
like, I've never met
Natalie and Richie, but meeting
them and talking with them
and what they do for a
living, and they are speakers,
and she is definitely a motivated speaker,
and just talking to her this week,
I'm like it's just calmed my nerves
I didn't even know that I had,
and it's been eye-opening,
and I've enjoyed meeting new people.
Makes you wanna be a go-getter.
Yeah, they're awesome.
I really enjoy the people
that we put ourselves around.
It makes us better people
because of the people we have
surrounded ourselves with.
Yeah, and what's the saying?
You're the average of the five people
you surround yourself with the most.
Surround yourself with good people.
I'm just very grateful, and I love you.
And I love you.
And I am grateful for this opportunity,
and we are celebrating eight
years of marriage this month.
This month.
Holy crap, eight years.
That's a long time, and I kept thinking,
when we came here, 'cause this
is such a beautiful place,
of when Jared proposed to me,
and the conversation that Jared and I had
when he proposed to me.
I remember it in my head clear as day.
I remember what I was wearing.
I just remember thinking,
like, I really wonder--
What are we gonna be like?
And I would have been
happy if our original plan
turned out, but I think
I'm even more grateful
for where we're at now
with our relationship,
with our kids, and I miss them so much.
We video chatted with them yesterday,
and it was the sweetest thing.
Our boys are so happy, and
I feel like they're mature.
Jackson's so mature.
When I talked to him, I was
nervous how he would be,
but he was like just happy, you know?
He's a good boy.
Can't wait to go home and
kiss them and give them gifts.
Yeah.
He's like, "Did you get a gift,"
'cause I told him when I left, I said,
"We're gonna leave for a while,
"but we'll get you something special,"
and that kinda always helps kids.
It helps me.
You'll be gone?
Bring me home some flowers.
Yeah, absolutely.
Well, we're gonna go look at the temple
a little bit more, because
it's stinking beautiful.
It's beautiful like you.
Thank you.
(energetic music)
Morning.
We are at a book factory right now,
and, right here behind us,
they are printing a book.
-  19,000 pages.
-  784, five, six, seven, eight.
Look at this just shovel
through the pages.
It's air-powered.
It's a vacuum.
The suction cups pick it up,
this suction cup pushes it over,
and then the feet right here grab it
and throw it into the
machine, and that's where
it gets all the lines
printed and everything.
-  That is incredible.
How many thousands of pages
do you think are here?
That stack over there is
20,000, just that small stack.
-  This is probably three, 400,000.
Yeah.
That's amazing.
It makes my printer feel so inadequate.
(laughs)
Don't ever show my printer this footage.
I know.
They'd be so jealous.
It's not every day you
get welcomed in China
with a red carpet, Joel.
Yeah, just today.
-  Just today.
-  What is happening?
I'm so excited to eat!
This is fun.
We're going to Hot Pot, which, apparently,
is like so stinking good.
I don't know.
WE've never been here, but
they have a red carpet for us,
which is so nice.
Smells amazing.
-  Yeah, it smells really good.
Hi, ni hao.
All right, everyone.
Have we learned our lesson from last time?
You boys all know,
'cause you've come here.
We're having a lunch meeting again today,
and none of us are sitting until--
The big boss.
Big boss comes.
Until big boss comes in.
Jimmy, you're a big boss.
(crosstalk)
They are gonna give us a big thing
of boiling water.
We will open these, and
rinse your stuff in them,
pour them out, put 'em off to the side.
Watch and see what Jimmy does first.
-  You wash your own dishes?
And then you'll wash your
dishes before you eat.
These are sanitary, but
they have you do it again
just so you feel good about it.
-  Cool.
He's gonna sit down.
He's gonna sit down where he can see,
where he can see the door.
He does?
That's where he usually sits
so he can sit down where
he can see the door,
people coming in and out.
-  I didn't know that.
Yeah, that's why they sit down first.
(speaking foreign language)
Right now, they're
talking about which meal
they're gonna have first.
-  No, they're not.
I don't know what they're saying.
-  Jimmy is gonna teach us how--
-  Big boss man.
-  Big boss man.
We call him that too.
Is put our potstickers in here, cook it,
take it out, put it in our sauce.
This is like the cook, to cook it,
and then this is your flavor.
-  Awesome.
Is essentially the way
that I'm figuring it out.
Now, all of them is ready
to eat except this one.
-  In the hot pot.
You have to put inside, the four of you.
Others, you can, you
know, pick it by yourself.
Mm, it's so good.
Noodles are amazing.
-  This is what the
entire table looks like
with almost all of the food.
-  This is amazing.
-  This is so crazy.
Hey!
This is the lining of a cow's stomach.
-  Right over there.
-  This is our favorite sauce.
-  But then we've
got this table over here
which has a lot more stuff on it too.
He's making some fried rice right now.
This is incredible.
This is so delicious.
The first several days
while we have been here,
it has been more business.
We've talked with owners.
We've been with our friends
that work here in China,
and, now, we are kind of on more
of the tourist-y stuff today.
We are taking a three-hour train ride.
I'm not quite sure where.
I don't know where it is.
-  Just following everyone.
Bullet train, and it goes
like 200 miles per hour.
-  300!
300 miles per hour!
Girl, that's crazy!
-  I can't even think that fast.
Tonight, tomorrow will
be a fun, tourist-y day.
Huh, Bon?
I'm having fun with you.
I know. This is incredible.
I feel like I haven't even vlogged tons
personally or especially with Bonnie,
but we've been walking
like seven miles a day.
We've been running, so now I
can take a little breather now.
Wasn't that food delicious, Bonnie?
Our feet are swollen.
Our faces are swollen.
Our tummies are swollen.
Oh my gosh, I wish I could
have filmed that experience
that we just went through.
We all just rushed into this.
We're going into the bullet train,
and everyone is like fighting for space.
It's crazy.
Here we go.
Bonnie] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Move, move move.
Here we go.
14B and A.
-  Oh, you're so hot.
I know. It's really hot in here.
-  This is a lot
more space than I thought.
This is like first class.
This is very nice.
No, this is like Delta common.
This is nice.
We're going on a three-hour bullet train.
-  Bullet train.
-  Jackson, thinking of you.
Look at these trains, Jackson.
This is so cool.
-  These are the tracks.
What are you looking at?
Sometimes you give me looks,
and it makes me laugh and scared.
Bonnie scares me sometimes.
♪ We're going on a trip ♪
♪ In our favorite rocket ship ♪
What are you doing, Jar?
I'm getting your audio adapter
so you can listen to that book.
-  Oh, thanks.
-  And I've got your headphones.
-  And Jared has his.
My Nintendo Switch.
-  Heck yeah,
I wanna play with you.
I wanna play Mario, yeah.
I wanna play with you.
You can kinda do two-player on it.
Bonnie and I are gonna listen to a book
and one of Natalie's suggestions.
It's not always that way.
You guys all have to go follow everyone,
but especially Natalie's Instagram.
She is amazing.
We've got The Ohana Adventure on Youtube--
I really like her.
You're so nice to me.
We've got Natalie Norton.
You're nice to me.
We've got Richie Norton, aka Ricky Bobby.
Hello!
What up?
-  Ricky Bobby!
-  Ricky Bobby!
And is your Instagram The Ohana Adventure?
-  Yes.
As well as Youtube.
There you go. You have it.
Did you introduce me?
Oh, and this is Bonnie.
-  No, do you need an introduction?
-  Yes!
We are sisters.
Some people don't know that.
Every time.
My channel is Bonnie Hoellein.
Thank you.
-  Such an angel.
-  Jerk!
Look at our eyes.
Your eyes are so much bigger than mine.
When I smile, sometimes Jared goes,
"Open your eyes up," and I
always get a little flustered,
'cause I'm like, "They are open".
They're open as I can get them.
I don't know.
My teeth are unproportionately
too large for my face.
(upbeat music)
We're going to the mountains.
(upbeat music)
After the beautiful
bullet ride that we took,
it was a three and a half hour ride,
we checked into our hotel.
Now, we're gonna go.
(horn beeping)
Whoa! Hey!
I'm walking here.
(horn beeping)
Hey!
No! I'm serious.
Stop it.
Okay, that's enough.
Jeepers, you know.
(horn beeping)
Hey, I'm serious!
What's the big deal?
We're going to this place
where we're gonna go fishing
with birds, using birds to fish.
Is that right?
That is correct.
How does it work?
I, well, actually, have no idea.
-  Actually, the
bus driver's driving
with the door open.
Hey, we're gonna find out.
Ellie, have you ever
fished with birds before?
No, I don't even know what we're doing.
This is like the first I have--
-  Well, I'll tell
you what we're doing.
We're fishing with birds.
That's what we're doing,
but how is the question.
How?
Ni hao.
Ni hao, that's how.
(laughing)
That owner today was
so nice, so talkative.
He was probably really nice,
'cause we let him sit down first.
We were very respectful,
but he really was.
We followed cultural rules.
Okay, here we go.
We're walking down.
K, everyone watch your step.
Be careful.
-  My shoelaces will light the way.
-  There you go.
Those glow in the, they do.
Oh my gosh, Ellie, come over here.
Look at this.
This is what we're using to fish.
Isn't this incredible?
What in the world?
(crosstalk)
-  They train these birds,
and they get fish for them to eat.
-  It's heavy, right?
It's not really light.
Yeah, heavy on my arm.
(gentle music)
Those are the birds.
Those are the birds.
Oh my gosh!
They're swimming underneath the water.
-  No, those birds are fishing.
-  He's got a fish in his beak.
He's trying to swim with it.
See him try to swallow it?
-  Yeah.
-  He can't get it down.
-  Now, he's bringing it.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, no way.
No freaking way.
No freaking way.
He's got a fish.
Oh!
Oh my gosh.
-  That's huge.
That's the size of him.
(cheering)
-  They're holding their breath
and going underwater.
That's so crazy to me.
-  Swimming upstream, look at him.
-  Both got 'em?
-  Look how big their necks are.
-  But they're gonna, yeah,
jump up on the boat.
That's so crazy to me.
(gentle music)
After a long day's work, these
birds are just going to town.
Look at them chowing down on their dinner.
-  Sitting next to their master.
And they're just staying there.
Like, they're staying on the boat,
because they're trained
to do that for these guys.
That is so cool.
Those birds, it was incredible
the way that they did that,
and these fishermen are with these birds
for such a long time.
Those fisherman, this is their living.
Livelihood.
Yeah, this is how they make money
is they take these birds
who are natural fishermen,
fisher birds or something--
Fish birds.
Fish birds, and they dive under the water,
and they grab these fish,
and those fishermen sell
the fish that these birds grab,
so this is their livelihood,
and a way that they've improved on it
is that they show tourists
exactly what they do.
Yeah, 'cause then we pay them, tip them--
Yeah, we tipped them and paid them
for us to follow them on
the boat and everything,
and it's pretty cool to
see how they can take
this thing that they've
been doing for generations.
They were saying this is their third time,
third generation fishermen
doing this things
with these birds, and--
And they listen to him.
He yelled at them.
Yeah, it's incredible.
It was like Penny.
It's like, "Get over here! Come here".
Bring the fish.
Hop up up here.
Hey, is what they were saying.
I just thought it was so cool.
(gentle music)
