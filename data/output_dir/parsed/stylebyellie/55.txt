- Hey buddy, I like your
hat, way to be cool.
- Yeah, see that's awesome.
(laughs)
Ellie got a phone call
from the dermatologist
and it's not exactly
what we wanted to hear.
- If you guys feel like you need
to get something checked out,
don't ever be nervous,
go get it checked out.
- The heck?
- The heck?
♪ I believe I can fly ♪
Oh my goodness gracious,
would you look at that,
it's a Mickey pancake kinda day.
Oh boy, oh boy.
- Every day is a Mickey
pancake kind of day.
-  Yeah.
Good morning guys.
How's everyone doing today?
- So good.
-  Good.
- Did you guys all sleep in?
Good job.
- Yeah they did.
- We're just getting breakfast going.
-  Mmm-hmm.
= Someone missed school.
- Oops, someone slept so much,
that they missed school
and some parents slept so much
that they missed school too.
And that's a rare
occasion in our household.
- And you know what?
That's okay.
I'm okay with that.
- That's okay.
(Jared laughs)
- We have lived in our
house for over a year,
almost a year and a half,
and I think we've tried
to do this three times
and have failed to finish.
We want blinds or shades
or rollers or whatever you
call them in our house.
And we've tried to do it three times,
we've had the measurements a bunch,
but we've never fulfilled it,
so I think today that is the goal,
is to get blinds and get
them ordered to be installed.
Are you coming with me bud?
Where are we going?
- To Lowe's.
- To Lowe's, one of our favorite stores.
And look Jackson look,
my hoodie and your hat,
they match.
- Hey buddy, I like
your hat, way to be cool
- Yeah, see that's awesome.
(laughing)
Hey bud, I love to see you smile.
Smiling is--
seeing you smile makes my heart happy,
you know that bud?
- Do you have this, the thing?
- Yeah, I've got it right
here, pretty cool, huh?
I guess I should be more specific.
We have blinds in our basement,
but we don't have blinds upstairs
by the kitchen and in the living room
and that's where we really want it.
So we are getting blinds for those areas.
- Look at those blinds.
- Wow, yeah these are cool,
but they're not what we're looking for.
These ones look really nice
but yeah, nothing like this.
Yeah, see I don't like the honeycomb.
Ooh wow, that's different
and matches up to the other one.
I think we want rollers,
so they're the most hidden.
And maybe in a perfect world,
boop, hit a button, zzsssooop,
- Oh, there's a roller.
that's kind of what we're looking for.
- Roller.
-  Oh yeah, those
are the window rollers.
These ones are kinda fun,
huh, because there's a stick.
Wamp.
Wamp.
Hey, I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.
Which one do you want to hear first?
- The good news.
- The good news?
The good news is we're not leaving yet,
the bad news is they don't have
what we're looking for.
- Oh.
- We gotta look for a
couple other things though.
We got our Folex, which
is the best carpet cleaner
that we've ever had, we
really really like it.
And what else?
What's this?
- Ice cleaner.
- Yeah, Ice Melt, so we
can put it on our driveway,
because we still have
some ice in our driveway,
because it is cold in Utah, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well I came into Lowe's thinking
that we were gonna come
out with some samples
or some orders for our blinds,
but today is not the day.
They didn't have anything,
and so I'm kinda disappointed.
But also at the same time I am going home
right away, because Ellie got a phone call
from the dermatologist
and it's not exactly
what we wanted to hear,
so I will let Ellie explain the phone call
to you guys.
-  Calvin doesn't
even know what's going on.
Cal, do you think this will help?
- The heck?
- Bathroom.
-  What is it?
- Potty.
- What is that?
- That's Mickey.
- Mickey and the Roadster
- Mickey--
- And the Roadster Racers.
- That's right.
- This is a toilet.
It's a potty for you Calvin.
- Let's open it up.
-  Do you think
you'll sit on it Calvin?
- You wanna sit on this one?
- No.
(laughing)
- We'll see.
I am one to try anything and everything
if this is gonna make Calvin excited
and want to sit on the potty
even more than he already does, so be it.
We're gonna try it.
My neighbor came over last night
and she's like yeah I used
that all the time with my kids
and they really liked it.
And I thought, it's not gonna hurt,
we're gonna try it.
-  Do you want to sit on it?
- Yeah.
- Okay sit on it.
- Okay Jackson, show
him how you sit on it.
-  Can you sit on it?
- You sit on it like this.
- Yeah.
- Perfect.
-  Can you try it Cal?
- Yeah.
- And I'll push the button.
-  Now push the button.
- Calvin just got done
using the big boy potty,
but I'm pretty sure he was
holding it all morning.
And he finally went today,
I'm really proud of him.
So I'm anxious to see
if this helps at all.
- Okay Jack--
Calvin, now push the button.
Sit on it and push the button.
Push it down.
Yeah.
- The last few days we've been working
on potty training
and Calvin has been pretty good to go.
And then the last few days,
he's been getting upset
and he doesn't want
to sit on the potty
and so I've been giving him marshmallows
for sitting on the potty.
He'll sit for 10 seconds,
I'll be like you can have
a little baby marshmallow
and that's made him more excited.
And then when my neighbor told me,
she's like you should just get one,
just let him sit on that,
he'll think it's fun.
And maybe this will
continue our potty training
and make it a little
more exciting for him,
because he just keep sitting on it
and he was trying to go,
versus when I put him on the big potty,
he is like, okay I'm done, I'm done.
So maybe this will keep it going.
I will say I sanitized the
bathrooms the other day
and our whole house is going to really
need a good cleaning when we're all
said and done with this week.
(bright soulful music)
It is 5:30 and Calvin has
not had an accident today.
And I am so excited that we got this.
It actually has been really helpful.
He's kinda had it close to him.
He's loved carrying it around
and I came and looked at it,
and there was pee in it.
He went and pee by himself
and I didn't even know it.
Calvin.
He's been so cute, but I'm so proud of him
and I'm hoping that continuing
the next three days,
that'll be exactly a
week since we started,
it'll really set in, and
he'll do even better.
That's my hopes.
But I got a call from
the dermatologist today
and I told you guys that when Jared and I
went in a way I felt a little silly,
like I'm young, why am I
making this appointment
to get my whole body checked
out from head to toe?
But I just felt like I really should go
and I felt like Jared really should go.
And the doctor had taken one mole
off my back, but there was this other spot
that he saw, and he's like,
ooh that doesn't look good.
He goes we need to get rid of that one.
So he got rid of that one
and they just called
today with the results
and she said that it was an atypical mole,
and she said there's many scales of moles
or those type of moles and she said mine
leaned a lot more
towards the melanoma side
or maybe that was the stage
it was at or I don't know.
And it was really hard hearing it all,
but she said that I needed to go back in
and they needed to take more out
and make sure they got it all
and then I need to do a follow-up.
So it was a big deal
and I'm really glad that I just felt
that I should go and that
we went and got checked out,
because it's like what would happen if--
I'm young, what if I just didn't
make an appointment and go
and five years go by.
What would be the progress
of that, you know?
It's just kind of nerve wracking
and it was a little scary to hear,
but I also feel really good
because I know nothing's gonna come of it
and we've gotten it taken car of
and we're gonna keep an eye on it, so.
I feel good about that,
but just in the back of my
mind, I'm like, that's scary.
(laughs)
So if you guys feel like you need
to get something checked out,
don't ever be nervous.
Go get it checked out, please,
'cause you just never know,
you just never know, so I'm
just really glad that we went.
Look at my belly.
-  What?
-  I'm 18 weeks.
I'm gonna do an update soon
and a haul video.
Look at that belly.
It's growing big, huh mister?
Blub blub blub.
(bright jazzy music)
- Tonight I am making dinner
and as you can see, we have some veggies
on the tray, ready to rock and roll.
Potatoes, green beans, carrots
with a little salt and pepper and oil.
They're going to be cooking in the oven.
While they're cooking in the oven,
I have two steaks in here
that I was going to be pan-seared.
Once we have a good color on the sear,
a nice texture, we're
gonna put them in the oven
and they will finish
off with the vegetables,
and hopefully come off at
the same time, nice and hot.
(bright jazzy music)
(sizzling)
Oh baby, watch it sizzle, make it curl.
I wish you could smell this,
because it smells so stinkin' good.
I hope this turns out.
Every time I cook, like I
mentioned the other day,
I ruin everything, so
whether it's putting--
what did I just ruin?
A hot pan on the counter
top, I don't know.
I hope it turns out okay.
I feel like I've done this enough,
the pan-sear into the oven.
I feel like I've done it enough
that it's gonna be pretty good.
Just gotta keep an eye on it,
but it smells so stinkin' good.
I wish you could smell it.
I know you can smell it.
You're dying for it, huh?
Maybe we'll save a couple
pieces for ya, sister girl, huh?
Yeah?
That's a good girl.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
may I introduce to you tonight's dinner.
Save your applause until after the meal.
And Batman, do you approve Batman?
What are your thoughts
- He likes it.
- and opinions?
It looks pretty good
and that's why I like the pan-sear
is because it looks good.
It has a nice crisp outer edge
and a nice soft tender inside.
It is one of the harder ways
to mess up a steak, and for me,
that's what I need.
So go ahead and take the first bite
- Thank you Jared.
-  Oh you're so welcome my love.
- Penny you're being a good girl.
-  She's like if
I sit here good enough,
I can have a piece too.
- She knows I'll do it, if you're good.
-  (whispers)
Please please yes please.
- It's good.
♪ I believe I can fly ♪
- What kind of steak is it?
- It's just a sirloin,
nothing crazy incredible.
- So yeah I like sirloin.
The ribeyes I don't really like.
- Not a lot of fat, yeah exactly.
Ellie doesn't like the
marbling all that much,
which is where your flavor is,
- Because it's gross.
- but it's a good in
between steak, I think,
sirloin's pretty good, okay.
Alright time to eat dinner,
I want to taste this myself.
-  She is laying
her face on my leg.
That's so funny.
-  I don't know if
that's because of the donuts
or because of the food we're eating?
-  She wants me to give her food.
- Gosh, I laugh at myself,
I'm annoyed with myself,
so here's the sitch.
I literally just said I
like the seared steaks
because they are harder to mess up,
it's harder to overcook them,
but sure enough, I overcooked 'em.
They're not terrible, they're good.
They're really good to eat,
but it's just overcooked
than I wanted it to be.
It's more of a medium well than a medium
and I like them to be
medium and so does Ellie.
Maybe more medium well well,
but definitely not well done.
That's why you keep cooking.
You keep cooking,
so you learn to cook better.
Ever since Ellie gave me the phone call
that the lab results came in
from our cancer screening,
it's just made me think
about how grateful I am
that we were able to get
this done when we did
and how things can change going forward.
It's crazy how just something so small
can make a difference like that.
It's on Ellie's side of the family,
Bonnie, her dad and now Ellie
have to be careful about these things.
My dad had it,
and so I'm just grateful that we were able
to catch things early
and we'll have to see how these tests go,
but all in all, like Ellie said earlier,
don't be afraid to get things checked,
because it's not gonna hurt.
Knowledge is important and powerful.
So with that, I hope you
have a wonderful day.
Thank you for watching the video today.
If you enjoyed it, give it a thumbs up
and as always, we will
see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
