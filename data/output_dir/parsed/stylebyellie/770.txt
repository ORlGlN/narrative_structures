view right here absolutely gorgeous the
view on the inside of the vehicle is not
as pretty we have a pretty bad situation
right now making sure no cars are coming
this is a crazy corner Jackson
threw up everywhere and we're trying to
figure that situation all right now like
he I look back and he was just like all
over
are you okay buddy you okay yeah what do
you say he said oh man you're good you
didn't cry or complain you just said
mama and that's it oh man
you say oh man oh man and this is a
pretty pretty scary suck stop work on
right now all right we'll get him taken
care of and we'll get back on the road
I just really hope we don't miss our
flight because of this you think so I
mean it'll be close okay cross your
fingers for us I'm really hoping that
Jackson just had a little bit of car
sickness and that he's not sick
hopefully that's the case and we're
driving down this canyon and right now
it's actually pretty good but it is just
windy windy and even I am like are we
almost done like every little turn my
stomach is tight like trying to like
hold myself and then
so hopefully that's just the case
you're whining
back here like from his hair
they gave him a sucker he could not
might still get to him just and he
doesn't even want it but he is like pale
sorry
sweaty okay Jared never ever our YouTube
/ he's not my man
he's never been pulled over before and
we just passed a company said I can't
hold over how fast you speeding
I wasn't mindful I'm going with the flow
of traffic but I was following that guy
pretty close we're in the carpool lane
but on my right anymore
Oh people the streak continues
he pulled someone else over my bar was
amazing I was like this day can't get
anyone good it's actually it's not that
Jackson's calming down Jackson is now
eating his little sucker I got pretty
awful for a minute even my like I'm
pretty sure he just had a little bit of
car sickness
we'll see he'll dress
I took this sucker away
and take a second I took a second
and you woke up looking for
he was
get away
and then you will couple come forth
you
fellas it's so cute
yeah
high-five every time you go to the
airport Jackson actually does really
well and he loves to help every time we
go through the check through and he's
helping and I love it the workers for
the most part are really nice with him
and let him help they love it a shot of
it thank you shoo go stinky car seat
okay that was funny
we minimize the skin of our teeth I
think we forgot the security oh the poor
kid he's like I've already had morning
sickness today leave me alone
that was funny when I was trying to say
earlier what we barely made it like by
the skin of our teeth we like walk
through everything yeah it was crazy so
what we did is we actually drove to the
airport we checked our bags first and
then we went to the rental car place
about the
and buildup of gas and then we drove
back here here do on a cracker dead
Packer jack and then we took a shuttle
team back to the airport and then it was
cool because they actually had you go
through three chests so you can only do
anything you're not failing security
wasn't too bad but as soon as we got to
our gate we walked right on to the plant
like it was like boom we were we barely
got her time so we're all settled
bringing some crackers and we're ready
to her
ready Jackson
and we made
is that a good play Jackson
