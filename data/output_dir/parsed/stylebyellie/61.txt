- The first one to find Mommy's phone
gets to keep it.
In revenge!
- I'm so excited.
This is so fun.
(yelling)
- I had my AirPods that I was putting away
and it fell in here.
No no no!
Good morning my young child,
how are you doing today?
Good morning my young child,
how are you doing today?
You stinky bum.
(Jared laughs)
Okay boys, here's the deal.
We are gonna start off the morning
kinda how we did yesterday.
Mom has misplaced her phone.
And we're going to have a little contest,
okay Jackson, do you remember this from--
- She lost her?
- She lost her phone yeah.
So the first one to find Mommy's phone
gets to keep it.
Okay?
So let's find Mommy's phone, okay?
- Okay.
- And the first one to find it,
gets to keep it.
Let's race!
(laughing)
I'm gonna go tell Ellie
what I just did, in revenge!
Good morning.
- You found it?
-  No, I just told the kids,
the first person to find Mommy's phone
gets to keep it.
- Did you get it?
- Nope.
- We gotta start
- Go get it.
- looking for it.
(laughing)
Is it behind here?
Is it behind the bed?
It might be under the bed.
Is that it?
Is that it right there?
-  I found your wallet Dad.
-  You found my wallet?
Oh thanks bud, that's not
part of the contest anymore.
(lively guitar music)
Let's see if we call her, that might help.
-  Your call has been forwarded
to an automated message center.
- Oh great, it's dead.
Her phone's dead,
this is going to make
it much more difficult.
(lively guitar music)
Nope.
Do you know where Mom's phone is?
- (growls) Up.
-  Upstairs?
Do you know where it is?
- No.
- Guess what?
I do.
I found it.
It's right here.
I found it!
I don't know how we didn't see it earlier.
Alright Jackson, I found the phone.
Do you want to give it back to Mom?
Do you want to go give it to her?
Okay, go give it to her.
Say we found it Mom.
- You found it.
Where was it?
- It was on the car mat, like the road.
I was just like how did I not even see--
- Well I hid it so well, thank you.
-  I guess, pink on road.
- Thank you.
-  We did it
together didn't we boys?
-  Thanks.
- Jackson's a little upset
that he didn't find it.
But guess what Jackson--
- But you know what, you gave it to me.
-  Yeah, and you
found my wallet yesterday,
so that's a major point for Daddy.
- Jacks.
- I wanted to keep it.
- You can hold it, let's go charge it.
-  Yeah.
-  Good stuff.
-  Hey, not all is lost, okay boys?
Okay?
High five, thanks for your help.
(Jared laughs)
-  Calvin, what are you getting?
- I want my dog.
-  Your dog?
- Yeah.
Here's my dog.
-  You got your doggie?
(bright jazzy music)
- I feel like I'm wearing
the wrong outfit today guys.
-  You're the one that stands out.
- Today we are skiing
and I'm meeting up with
some good buddies of mine.
I think I see them over there.
Hey, I could tell that
purple jacket from anywhere.
(laughing)
What's up Zack?
Dan, Chaz, how's it going?
- Ciao.
- Ready for epic snow,
the powder is killer.
- Is it really dude?
I heard.
We had a major storm come in yesterday.
-  Yeah it dumped, it dumped.
- Dumped ice everywhere.
- There's a run right over there
that you will just die for.
- So this is my first time skiing,
so Zack, will you teach me everything
you know about skiing?
- Yeah yeah I got you.
-  Thanks.
(yelling)
(funky upbeat music)
- I know I put perfume on this morning
for the first time in months.
I feel so good.
My feet are scrubbed.
- Awww.
- My body's exfoliated.
Jared put Band-Aids on my moles
that are healing.
(Bonnie laughing)
He put Neosporin on that.
He thought his was getting infected.
-  Oh no.
- It's bad, but they're
good, they're healing.
But other than that,
- Your nails are done,
my nails are done,
- Look at this.
- We brought our jewelry.
-  Polished.
- We are all spruced up
ready for our photo shoot.
- Yay!
Oh my shirt's tucked into my pants.
-  This has been a
long time in the making girl.
- I'm so excited.
This is so fun.
(yelling)
- I know it's like bring--
well Jared's like just relax,
and have fun, he goes put loud music on
while you do the photo shoot.
- Yes.
- I'm like yes.
- Yes honey.
(jazzy bright music)
- We're gonna try something fun.
I'm gonna film Dan for
a little bit skiing.
He's fast, so it's gonna be
hard to keep up with him.
And then as we get to a certain point,
I'm gonna toss the GoPro to him,
you will catch it, right?
- I may or may not.
We'll see.
- And
- we've got Zack on backup, just in case
the GoPro goes down and
then we'll go from there.
Sound like a plan?
- Sounds like a plan,
- Ready?
- teamwork exercise.
- Break.
- Let's do it.
(bright jazzy music)
- Ready?
- Toss it.
Yah, we did it!
Here we go.
- I got ya, yeah!
(laughs)
Those are our two perfect auditions.
-  Do one to Zack.
- Ready?
-  Throw it.
- That run was a lot
shorter than I thought.
As soon as you tossed it to me,
it was like okay, we're
at the end of the run.
(laughs)
- Yeah.
- Just to give you an idea
of how bad the mountain is right now,
all of those red X's are closed hills.
There's three green ones that are open.
So it's a pretty bad day on the mountain
but we're making the best of it.
It hasn't been too terrible with ice,
but there has been a lot of spots
where there's exposed rock and weeds
and that sort of thing.
(funky upbeat music)
- It was a little crazy.
We had one minute left until we had
to get out of here.
One minute.
- Seriously, we bumped it.
- This is intense,
do you think it's gonna turn out good?
- I'm crossing my fingers,
but I think it will.
- I think so too.
We had fun.
- Do you?
- If you had fun with it,
usually it turns out well.
- Let's do this, round two.
-  There you go, it's right there.
- Waa!
(laughing)
- Alright, I think it's
our last run of the day.
Just a beautiful sight to see today.
(jazzy bright music)
- I, I suck hard.
Meager attempt.
(crashing)
My fault, terrible throw.
- No dude, you're okay.
- Terrible throw, my bad.
-  It wasn't a bad throw.
I wasn't going fast enough.
Dan's a speed demon, you
gotta keep up with Dan.
No no no!
I had my AirPods that I was putting away,
I have one in here,
one in here, and I was
taking one out of my ear
and putting it away
and it fell in here, like
in the emergency brake.
Shoot, how am I gonna get this out?
Oh man.
Gosh dangit.
Oh my heavens to Betsy,
there is no way.
Gosh dangit.
Hold please.
(machine humming)
- Can you hear the rock tumbler?
I think it only has five more days.
Our photo shoot was done,
it is cold outside,
so I am just doing
chores around the house,
getting things picked up and cleaned up
before the kids get home.
Bonnie and I had a really
big photos hoot today.
I'm sure you guys are
sick of hearing that,
because you're like, well
what is this photo shoot?
Bonnie and I have a fun project
that has been a year in the making.
Do not eat my orange juice Penny.
And we just did photo shoots,
we are finalizing everything,
and we will let you guys know very soon,
but we are so excited
and it was just so fun.
And Miss Penny's gonna
help me do the dishes now.
I hope Dad got good snow today,
he's skiing up in Park City.
I hope he got good snow.
If it's raining here,
it's probably snowing where he's at.
- So I spent five minutes trying
to get my AirPod out of
the emergency brake thing
and I think it's gone.
- Oh no.
- Yeah, I think it's gone.
- Whoa, we can get it.
We have Zack tonight, let's get Zack,
he can probably take
the thing apart easily.
- I was gonna say, he
probably has some of his--
- He's got the tools in his car.
- Right now.
- Yes.
- Oh good, oh I'm so
glad we're doing this.
(Dan laughs)
Okay so chance of plans,
I was gonna go home,
Dan was gonna go home,
- Yeah.
- Zack was gonna go home,
but we're here in Park
City during Sundance
and we got invited a dinner
with an ad agency that it's
beneficial for all of us,
so Dan, Zack and I are staying,
and we're gonna have dinner, but--
- The problem is, I'm wearing
these Nike sweatpants.
- Yeah, and I have these shorts
with Spandex on underneath,
and I'm not sure
if the ad agency
- No.
- would really enjoy having dinner with us
looking like this.
- These are fancy people.
- Fancy people that probably
come from LA and New York.
-  Yeah.
- and they're here in Utah.
They wouldn't go skiing.
They're probably just,
get the clothes for this day.
- In the suits and--
- So yeah.
- Yeah.
- So Dan and I have decided
that we were gonna go to the outlets
and get some nicer clothes,
clean ourselves up a little bit
and go to dinner.
(bluesy upbeat music)
Okay Zack, now that you've
seen our new outfits,
- Yes.
- you gotta give us the rating,
like who wore it better?
- Okay, so what's new,
you got the new jeans--
- Everything.
- You got new everything,
wow, okay.
- New everything.
- Except the shoes, the shoes are mine.
- I hope you got a discount on the jeans,
because they're missing some fabric.
-  Buy one, get one.
(laughs)
- But other than that,
I feel like you did a good job.
You got the nice soft liner
inside of the hoodie.
Okay, good with the hat.
- Feel the material on this.
- Is the hat new,
are you going hunting later today?
Is that, okay, cool cool.
- Yeah.
- I just didn't want you to see
the giant mole that's
on the back of my head.
So covered it up a little.
- Win some, you lose some.
- Look, you can see it's water resistant.
There's beads of water on top of the hat.
-  Very good observation.
- I am not the fashion guy in the room.
I'm wearing a hoodie,
so I would rate you 7.8.
- That's above average.
- Alright.
- Above average, okay.
-  Let's see what you got for Dan.
-  Dan?
- Alright, so this is not new,
neither are the dorky shoes.
-  Okay, but the hat?
-  When you say dorky shoes,
you say Yeezy's?
- Yeezy's.
-  Okay, ah jeez.
- He's bringing it up a notch.
- The blue belt is new.
-  The blue belt's new, okay.
-  Oh I didn't
know they have belts.
- The thing that I think is interesting
is today when we went skiing,
you were just in solid gray
everything was gray,
- That's true.
- and now that you went shopping,
you purchased all gray again,
except for the blue belt.
- It must be the color.
- It's the theme of the day.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 7.8, I'll go 7.9
just the button up shirt, man.
- Woo.
- The button up shirt.
- The button up shirt is nice.
-  That's good.
- I would take a .1 loss
to a button up shirt.
- If we both round it, we're both eights.
-  Okay, we'll round up.
- Yeah, round up.
- Solid eights, good job.
(Jared laughing)
(playful music)
(flushing)
-  Good job!
Say good job.
- Good job.
-  Good job Cal.
Alright, now this Mama
needs to clean up a mess.
(Ellie laughs)
It may have gotten all over the toilet.
- So here is the update.
We had dinner.
It was really great.
And it snowed about four or five inches
and the canyons are just really bad,
so I'm crashing here at my buddy's place,
and then I'm going to leave
and go home tomorrow morning,
because the roads are just
too bad for me to drive.
And I'm stranded in Park City right now.
That is where I'm gonna leave you guys.
Hope you have a wonderful day
and we'll see you guys tomorrow,
when I hopefully can get home, bye.
