We're working on Calvin's first.
He is very entertained with the dog,

- Is that the dog bone?
-  He is so entertained
with this little fire and the two people.
-  Does this one go here?
-  Oh let's look at the picture.
Let's flip the page.
Look.
- Mommy here.
-  Want me to
put the dog bone in it?
- Yeah.
-  Perfect.
What word did you learn
today while building?
- Hot dog style.
-  Yep, I always say
no, do it the hot dog style.
That's the word that we have learned.
We are getting far on this.
This looks great, okay next page.
He set them all up sitting.
Oh my gosh.
(Ellie laughs)
- That's cute.
They're having a little cookout.
-  Happy Christmas Eve.
-  Happy Christmas Harry.
Happy Christmas Ron.
- Happy Christmas Harry.

He always does that with his hands.
Penny's somewhere.
Ooh there's her bum.

Hi girl.
(Ellie laughs)
- Hi Penny.
- No no.
-  He goes no no no.
- Hey Penny.
(laughing)
Popping out to say hello.
-  Calvin's is done.
Wow, he's putting all
those people in his camper.
Good job, look at that.
Do you love it?
That's like our camper.
-  How cool is that?
- So cute and it opens up.
And that is it.
Look, those turned out awesome.
You have four wheelers.
And then these go down
to roll 'em into the back of the truck.
-  This is like ours.
Like we have a trailer.
And we have a four-wheeler.
-  Grandpa has a truck.
Thank you.
That was so unbelievably fun.
- They loved that.
That's so cool.
(Jared sings "The Nutcracker March")
- Let's go, we're late!
- Look how good my
family looks for church.
Yes, she's absolutely right.
We are running late for church.
We have five minutes to get there,
and it doesn't take that long,
but we gotta get the kids in the car.
Okay we're going to church
and we'll see you in a second.
Bye.
- You've got to lead the music.
- Oh that's right.
I have to lead the music
in front of the entire church today.
It's gonna be crazy, and I'm kinda scared.
Looks like we're having a white Christmas,
going to church with a white Christmas.
Give me a kiss.
Oh that's my good boy.
Merry Christmas my boy.
(upbeat music)
And just like that,
we are back from church.
We're having a great time.
We've got some dessert out,
we've got some snacks, chips and salsa.
Jackson are you playing with your Lego's?
- These came apart.
-  You know what?
We're gonna have to put it back together.
What do you say about that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, another favorite
Christmas or holiday snack
that we have, are little smokies.
Oh man, those are heating up.
We especially like those
when we watch football
games, like the Superbowl,
those are like the go-to snacks.
Ah, this just feels so good Ellie.
- The kids were great at church.
Church was so fun,
because they had so much
music today, more than normal.
- Yeah, it was really fun.
- It was so fun.
- So I lead the primary kids.
They all got up in front
of the whole entire church
and did sign language
and sang Silent Night.
And I stood up and did
all the sign language
for Silent Night.
Which was so fun albeit,
I'll admit it, my heart was racing.
I was nervous, because all of the kids
were watching me for the signs.
- And all the adults were like--
- Yeah, well because it would be different
if I was standing up on stage,
like people were expecting
me to do that stuff,
but I'm standing on the ground level
in front of the kids,
and so I kind of stick
out like a sore thumb.
So it is Christmas Eve
and we are just getting things started.
- Jackson and Calvin, come here.
-  Okay.
- We've had these for
probably a year and a half.
We brought them from our apartment
into the house.
Haven't opened 'em yet.
I've been waiting for a special occasion.
- What are these?
-  Well I'm gonna show you
what we're gonna do tonight, okay?
Which one do you like?
Do you like the bear
or do you like the fox?
- I want the fox.
- Okay, Calvin can have the bear.
Come here Cal.
These are sleeping bags.
- What?
- And the kids end up in our room
and in our bed,
and I thought tonight, for Christmas Eve,
it would be fun to put these on our floor,
and let the boys sleep on the floor
in their fun sleeping bags.
Would you want to do that Jackson?
- Yeah.
-  I think he likes it.
Calvin, where are you mister?
Hi Mr. Slowpoke.
-  Mr. Slowpoke!
-  Come here.
Does this look fun?
Yeah, it's a sleeping bag.
Here, grab yours Jacks,
or grab yours Cal, come here.
And I thought that you guys might think
this is fun for tonight.
So tonight, when we get back from dinner,
it's gonna be late,
so we're kind of getting going
with our evening telling
the kids the plan.
Do you think that sounds fun?
- I need poo.
-  You need to go potty?
- Yeah.
-  Okay Let's go,
hold this, hold this,
let's go, let's go, let's go.
I think this is so cute.
Ah!
Okay, you like the idea Jacks?
- Yes, I want to open my gifts.
- Okay we're gonna open the sibling gifts.
Is that yours?
- Yeah.
- The kids just can't wait any longer.
They want to open the
gifts from each other,
which is exactly what we are gonna do.
We are actually doing our Christmas eve
a little early before dinner.
- Don't step on it.
-  So the kids won't
be too tired when we get home.
Okay Calvin, can you give Jackson his?
- Yeah.
-  You hold it, wait for Daddy.
Okay you hold that.
Now Jackson come and get Calvin his.
- Okay.
- But it's heavy.
-  These are the presents
that the kids picked out for each other.
Come here Cal, over here.
- There's a little gift for you.
There's a little gift for you.
-  Oh fun.
- Mom loves little gives.
-  Daddy just wrapped me something.
- Right here.
- Wow I like little gifts.
- This is for Grandma Mecham,
and we're gonna take
this over to her house
a little later, okay?
I think we should go--
What did you do?
We always did
youngest to oldest.
- Youngest.
- You open yours.
-  Okay, Calvin
can open his first, okay?
-  That was so
nice of Jackson to say.
Okay, rip it up.
-  Okay Cal, start
right here on the side.
Yeah, start right there.
-  There you go, now pull it up.
Good job.
Keep going, yeah.
-  You want to grab
your knife for that tape?
- See Mom and Dad, I've
got it in my pocket.
-  Wow, keep going mister.
- Is that a pocket knife Dad?
-  Sure is, this is
one from Grandpa and Grandma.
-  Is this from Jackson, Calvin?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, you open it up.
- Open it up.
- A dog guitar.

-  Strum it.
-  Do you like it?
- Calvin, let me show you how.
-  He loves it, Jackson.
- Let me show you how.
- He loves it.
- Watch Jackson do it.
(guitar strumming)
-  Aunt Bonnie had
one of these at her house,
and Calvin just about
went nuts not having it.
So when Jackson saw
it, he was like Calvin.
-  Okay, let
Calvin have a turn now.
-  Okay, Calvin
say thanks to Jacks.
- Thanks.
-  Wow.
(strumming)
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, I think you're
good to open yours mister.
You have waited all week to open this.
- Every day, can we open a present?
Can we open a present?

stories that they did.
So he was a storyteller.
-  He was a good storyteller, yeah.
- Yeah he was.
- He sure was.
- As long as his eyes were closed.
(laughing)
He'd close his eyes.
- You know, I didn't notice
that at first in our marriage,
but it was just later on
that he started doing that.
And I used to think,
what's wrong with him,
why does he keep his eyes shut?
Why doesn't he want to see
what's going (laughs)--
- He was in his stories.
- Yeah.
- You gotta envision is while you tell it,
you know, and you just think about it.
Do you ever remember seeing Grandpa
and hearing him telling stories.
- Oh all the time.
If you knew Grandpa Gibbs,
you know he told stories.
We loved him.
