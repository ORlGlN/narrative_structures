- Are you taking a little
power rest from preschool?
Were you busy today?
What did you do at preschool?
Did you enjoy painting?
Yeah?
Why are you so quiet?
Hi.
- Hi.
- Why are you so quiet
Are you all camera shy?
(laughs)
(paper rustling)
Come here, I wanna see what you did.
I looked at this when I got
it, and I thought you did
so good.
Did you do all of this by yourself?
Did your teacher help you?
You did this by yourself.
Jackson brought this home
from school and I seriously
was like, "He is doing so good!"
He traced his name.
Oh, is that your truck?
Wow.
And he traced all of that
and he did so good by staying
around the lines.
I'm proud of you.
You're so quiet.
You're so quiet.
Do you just wanna rest?
Yeah?
And watch a little show?
Well, I am gonna let him rest.
Seriously, I was so proud of him.
The house is a disaster.
- Mommy, play that.
-  Oh, do we need to charge that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is a disaster.
We have lots of picking up to do.
We have left over dinner from
the other night (giggles)
still just sitting there.
Kinda gross, need to pick up.
-  Okay, roll it out.
(mom mumbles)
You got the camera (laughing).
(boys giggling)
Good job boys, you're such good helpers.
Uh oh, uh oh.
- Almost.
- We almost had it perfectly.
- It almost needs to be pulled--
-  So we need to pull
it this say just a smidge,
and then rotate it that much right there.
- Simon says touch your ear.
-  Simon says touch your toes.
Simon says wiggle your nose.
(giggles)
Simon says sit on your bum.
-  Okay, now stay
there 'til the rug's done.
-  (laughs) Let's pull it hurry!
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
(rug flops)
- One, two, three.
(rug flops)
(Calvin talking indistinctly)
He wants you to touch your eye, Jacks.
Tell 'em what else to do.
Do your nose.
-  Oops.
- Oh, too much?
- Yeah, I just did a little
too much.
I just don't know my own strength.
- (laughs) Touch your bum.
- Touch your bum?
Your head.
- Awesome.
- I think that's it.
- We're getting there.
(boys cheering)
- Guys, I'm tellin' ya, as
even as much as I did it
as a kid, our furniture is
not an obstacle course, okay?
Look, Calvin's even participating.
Woop!
Blast off!
Woo!
Penny, come!
That's a good girl, that's a good girl.
So mom went to a church activity.
We have one hour til she gets home.
We have all this furniture
that we still have to move.
I don't want Ellie liftin' all this stuff
if she doesn't have to.
So I called my brother in law, Joel.
Joel's on his way over
here and we're gonna see
if we can get all of the
furniture in the living room
set up just the way it was
before Ellie gets home.
Hopefully that will make her smile.
I don't know, maybe snicker a little bit,
maybe do a little bit of the heel click.
I don't know, maybe do
a little dance for me,
do a moon walk, recite
the Pledge of Allegiance?
I don't know, something of
the sort, I'm hoping to get
some sort of positive reaction from Ellie
once this is done.
Penny, come!
That's a good girl, yes!
Soft.
Oh, so, so, so, so soft.
So, so, so, so soft.
Oh, that's a good girl!
(upbeat instrumental music)
By Job, I think I've done it.
I think I have everything.
You probably will notice before I do
if there's something missing.
But I've got the couch,
I've got the ottomans,
I've got the lamps, I got the accessories,
what do you call that?
Decor?
Other lamp, genie lamp,
all of that stuff.
The bar stools, the table, the chairs.
I wiped everything down,
I vacuumed everything.
(Calvin talking indistinctly)
Yeah bud?
- (mumbles) in my bed.
-  You wanna sleep
in your bed tonight?
- Mm hmm.
- Aw, okay.
Now it's just a matter
of Ellie to get home.
We'll see her reaction
and, crossing our fingers,
I'm really hoping she does the
Pledge of Allegiance for me.
That would be so sweet.
That would just be like really
satisfying, knowing that
I did a good job and she recites
the Pledge of Allegiance.
(snaps)
That or the Flashdance.
You know, the--
(laughs)
- Jared just yelled at me.
-  I had the camera
pulled up and everything
so I wouldn't miss you.
- It's okay.
You did the cleaning!
- Yeah, I did.
-  Mom!
- What do you think?
- This is so,
I mean, good!
- Yeah.
-  It looks great.
-  I hope everything
is in it's right place.
- I kind of love it better.
Like this is on the rug
- On the rug.
- not on the wood floor.
- And then these are on.
- Yeah, I think we have the
rug a teeny bit different
and I like it.
- Yeah.
- Feels so good.
- Good!
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
I just want it to be one less
thing you had to worry about
when you got home.
- Well, thanks.
(kisses)
- I went to a church activity.
That's where I went.
- Yeah.
- But you know what?
Our neighbor, Piper,
she had her puppies.
Do you wanna go see them?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Let's go see some puppies.
- The puppies are
several weeks old now, so I think it's--
- Can I hold them?
- I don't know.
We're just gonna pet them for now.
- Yeah, we're gonna look at them,
- 'Cause they're so little.
- yeah.
Are you excited to see some puppies?
- Let's go look.
- Let's go look
at the puppies!
- You think Penny's okay?
-  Yeah, she's great.
We played with her really hard.
- Okay.
- We really, really did.
- Awesome.
- I'm like outta breath,
- You're workin' hard!
- I'm outta breath because
I played with her so hard
and then I did all this.
I was like, Joel, we've got 45
minutes to make this happen.
And I think you've been gone
- I appreciate this.
- for like an hour or so.
Okay, I'm gonna get on my
shoes, you're out the door
and I gotta get my shoes on.
-  Aw.
- Alright, so we're gettin'
towards the end of the night
and the kids are in the tub.
And sometimes when it's
really late, the kids'll be
in the tub and I'll feed 'em some yogurt.
And Jackson's like, "Will
you feed us yogurt?"
I'm like, "Yeah."
So I'm sitting here feeding them yogurt
while they're playing,
and Jackson was going,
"Me, me, me, me, me,"
when it was his turn.
And then Calvin started doing that.
-  Please?
- Yes, and so I said, "Jackson,"
-  Please?
- you are a good example.
So if you say please
instead of "Me, me, me,"
Calvin will say please, and
that saying "Me, me, me"
is not nice.
And I said, "You need
to wait and say please."
So he started saying please
and I said, "See Jackson,
"you're such a good example."
And I said, "If you're nice
and kind, and you don't hit,
"and you don't bite, that means
that Calvin won't do that.
"Like, he will see--"
- Calvin bite me
when I didn't bitted him.
- And that's exactly
what he told me, he goes,
"But I don't bite and Calvin bites me."
You are such a good
example, and sometimes he is
a little biter, huh?
- And a kicker.
- Oh yeah.
And we really try hard
not to do that, huh?
Right?
- But he--
- He hurt your foot, huh?
- Well,
when he can run, we go
across to see the puppies,
he was riding a scooter and
he fell off and got blood
and the owie is under his blood.
- Under the blood, yeah.
Calvin got a little owie on his foot, huh?
But I just, I laughed out
loud, because he was like
"But I don't bite and Calvin bites me."
(laughs)
For the most part, Calvin's
really good to listen
and watch exactly what Jackson does.
And it's weird--
It's just been nice having
two of the kids close in age.
Calvin just gets it 'cause
he sees Jackson, you know?
You are a good example.
- Me, me, me, me.
- Even with potty time,
Jackson, it took a long time
to get 'em comfortable to
even sit on the toilet,
whereas Calvin already is
sitting on the toilet often
and sometimes even going.
And it's just been awesome.
He sees Jackson and he wants to do exactly
what his brother does.
So, we're saying please now
instead of me, me, me, me, me.
- Please can I have
some more yogurt?
- Yes,
- Please?
-  Please?
Alright, who's gettin' out first?
Who's gettin' out first?
(laughs)
They usually point to each
other is what happens.
Who's gettin' out first?
No, you no Calvin?
I think we should get you out first.
- No.
(laughs)
- Usually I say, "Okay,
who's gettin' out first?"
and they both always point to each other.
You're it today.
- No.
- Yes, you're getting out
first, come on.
- Okay, come on!
- Okay,
go play.
- Bye have fun!
- Bye (laughs).
So I was getting Calvin
dressed, Jackson's like,
"You wanna play with me?
"Come on."
And he said it like a hundred times.
So if I set the camera up
he might come in and do it
one more time.
'Cause he was doing it so many times.
So cute!
We, how Jared and I are
feeling, we've been home
4 days now, 5 days, and
I don't know if jet lag
hits really bad on the third day?
That's what Joel said,
and Joel knows everything,
by the way.
So yes, I believe him.
But really, like the third, fourth day,
or the third day, I really was feeling it.
And today I'm feeling much better.
I had a really slow start to
my day, but now I'm getting
ready for the night.
I have a little bit more energy.
But I'm ready to have a
good night's rest tonight.
That's for sure.
Our house is getting put back together,
the floors look great.
They look so, so much better.
We did a lot of, I think
we talked about this
on our house video, I don't
know how much we've talked
about it on the vlog.
But, we have a lot of
scratches and surface stuff
because when the yard wasn't done yet,
and Penny was coming in and
out and we were coming in
and out, there was a lot
of dirt and rock that got
brought in the house, and I
just can tell a huge difference.
It feels really fresh and
like it doesn't look dull
especially right here.
So I'm really happy we did it.
It was kind of a pain 'cause
we had to move everything,
but I wanted to get it
done sooner than later.
So I feel much better
and so grateful Jared
and Joel brought all the furniture in.
So nice of them.
Now I just have to get
this kitchen cleaned up.
One space at a time (laughs).
I'm slowly working on the
house, getting things organized
and decluttered and getting
ready for the holidays.
Can't believe Thanksgiving is next week.
I love Thanksgiving.
There's so many holidays, it's like,
"What's your favorite holiday?"
And I always love 4th of
July because it's just fun.
Like, families come
together, cooking outside,
it's hot, I love the
heat, swimming, I love
the 4th of July.
But there's something about Thanksgiving
that's really special too.
So, I'm really excited for that.
- So with all of our China
footage, I've actually been
editing that still, and I've
been taking two or three days
and combining them into one vlog.
So, I have like, two hours
of footage every single night
that I combine down into
anywhere between 10 and 25
or so minutes.
And yesterday was our anniversary, yes!
So I didn't do any work that day.
And by the time Ellie
and I were ready for bed,
that's when I started working.
So I didn't end up
going to bed until 3:30,
and then I woke up at six to
get the kids ready for school
and for some other stuff
that we have goin' on today.
It is now 7:45, I fell
asleep putting Calvin to bed.
So I am going to go to
bed and I'm gonna wake up
bright and early tomorrow
and edit this video.
(laughs)
So, I'm gonna say goodnight.
I'm not sure if Ellie's
gonna say anything.
She's with Jackson right
now, but if she does,
she'll talk to you then.
If not, thanks for
watchin', have a good night.
I'm zonked.
(crash)
