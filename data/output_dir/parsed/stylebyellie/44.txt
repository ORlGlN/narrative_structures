- There's something even more important
and cool that I wanna show you.
Wow!
(laughs)
Changed our life!
- Potty dance, potty dance!
- Yeah!
- Good morning guys!
It is time for a brand new awesome day.
We are cleaning up after
our Super Bowl Extravaganza.
We got the vacuum going,
we got the kids over here
I gotta tell you this real quick.
So, when Landon and Julie
come into your life
- Oh dear
- They do some incredible things.
They turn your life upside down
- They make your house a mess,
- No no no
- They eat your food
- No no no, listen to this.
Ellie and I have lived in this house
for like year and a half now
and we've never made a
change like you have.
- What do you mean?
- Do you see our couches?
Look at this!
There's some much more
room for activities!
You just opened that couch up, you're like
"Oh yeah we can fit more people here,
we can watch the Super Bowl"
Changed our life.
thank you for being here
and making this change
- Thank you.
- Julie's had plenty of
opportunities to rearrange homes so
(Jared laughs)
- Did you guys have so
much fun with your cousins?
Yeah?
Oh, are you going to sleep?
Let's be so quiet, he's going to sleep
Okay yeah, we gotta be quiet okay?
Oh he's out like a light, he is so tired.
He is so tired, he's so tired,
let's make sure he sleeps so good.
Okay Calvin, we have been working
really really hard with potty training.
We've been doing some great things
we've had some ups and downs,
and I've got something here for you
that I think you're going to love
and it's going to help
you with potty training.
Do you want to see it?
- Mhm.
- Okay, so look here.
I've got a potty training watch!
- Yeah!
- Do you want it?
- Mhm.
- Okay, now let's put it on your wrist.
So what this does - here
let's turn it this way -
Is this will tell you when
to go sit on the potty.
So when it sings its song,
it means okay let's go sit on the potty!
It's your potty watch!
So we'll set the timer,
it's singing!
What does that mean?
Let's go sit on the potty!
Let's go sit on the potty, it's singing,
let's go sit on the potty!
Yeah!
Okay, we've got it all set up.
So what it is, is, it's a
watch that has a timer on it
it goes in 30 minutes, 60
minutes, 90 minute intervals
and we have it set to 30 minutes
he just went for a little bit
we're gonna try again in 30 minutes.
But as soon as you hear the song,
where do you go?
Yeah, we used it on the potty!
Good job, bud!
- It's not gonna work
- Well guess what?
It only plays when he has to go potty.
Did you know that?
Magic.
Okay, so when it plays again,
you sit on the potty, okay bud?
Hold it up in the air and say "Yeah"
- Yeah!
- (laughs)
Oh hey there, those are some
nice shoes you got on there,
do you think they fit you pretty well?
- Actually they don't.
- They don't?
They don't fit you, why?
- Because they're big.
- They're too big?
Oh I don't know, I think
they look pretty good on you.
- No they're yours.
- Oh they're mine?
Okay, I'll put them on.
A little slipperoo here,
a little slipperoo there.
I love shoes that you can slip on.
Like whether they have laces or not,
but if you can slip the shoes on,
it just makes it so nice.
I love, I just love to slip my shoes on.
You know, I just love it.
- Poo!
- Poo?
- You farted in your pants!
- Look, they can't smell it,
so they don't have to know about it!
Don't reveal my secrets, guys!
Come on, you're on my team guys, be real.
Get with the picture.
Let's be on the same team, the same sides.
- Potty dance, potty dance!
Guys we are so happy over here!
Our neighbor, I think Jared
may have told you guys,
- It's dead!
- Whoa, let me look at it!
How many more minutes?
28 more minutes!
My neighbor the other day told us that her
girl they just potty trained and that
she didn't like the potty watch.
Woo, you okay?
You okay?
You just ran into my leg.
That she didn't like it, and so
she's letting us have it for Calvin
and this morning we've had no accidents!
And he's been going, good job!
I am so proud of you.
Good job, Calvin!
You're welcome, what did you say?
Say thanks Mom.
- Thanks Mom.
- I'm so proud of him.
Good job, and Jackson's
been cheering him on.
So, so far, that potty
watch has done really great.
And you guys even told us, you're like
"Ellie you should try
the potty watch for him"
which I wanted to look into but
Yay for awesome neighbors
that will let you have theirs.
(laughs)
Are we ready to go?
Good girl Penny!
We just have to run an errand.
- And then hammer throw.
- Guess who just went to the potty again?
- You did a good job Mom!
- (laughs) Oh my gosh.
- What are you doing?
- We're playing with the
scooters and I got Jackson.
- You guys are literally
playing chicken right now.
Okay, who's going to win?
- I want a bike.
- You want a bike?
- I want a different, I want a scooter.
- Okay, change up your vehicle,
and then you can go Round Two with Boston.
Okay, just be very careful, Jackson.
On your mark, get set, go!
(laughs)
Oh no, he's overpowering!
Hey, are you guys playing chicken too?
I think they both lost that one.
Here we go, catch it!
Oh it bounced right off of you!
Okay throw it back here and
I'll throw it to Boston.
Whoa, got it, yeah!
Ready, Boston?
- Yeah!
- Oh, so close!
Okay throw it here!
- Okay!
- Yeah!
Going down the slide
to see if you catch air
- It's wet.
- Oh, hurry and go down so it dries.
Yeah!
Three, two, one, go!
Woo!
Was that fun?
High five.
So Calvin has only had one accident today
we put on the potty watch and at first,
it was like a miracle in the making.
So Calvin loved it.
He loved it.
as soon as he heard the song,
he wanted to take his drawers down
he wanted to go potty all by himself.
He didn't want any interference.
He didn't want us to touch
him, he wanted to do it.
I feel like Calvin's pretty independent,
he wants to do things by himself.
But, as time has gone on today,
throughout the afternoon,
Calvin hears the music and he runs away.
(laughs)
So, the song just went off, and
he ran and hid in the corner
so there's definitely some work
to be done with this watch.
Alright bub, it's your turn.
Stand up, there we go.
Whoopsie daisy there we go!
Okay, we're doing haircuts.
Jackson it's your turn buddy.
- No!
- Yes, you ready for your haircut?
Calvin's already done, it's your turn.
Do you guys wanna see what Jackson
looks like when he's scared?
- Whoa!
- (laughs)
- Whoa!
Not too scared are you?
Whoa!
Okay Jackson, do you want
the bowl cut or the Mohawk?
Or the hard part?
- The good part.
-  The good part?
Just a good part.
-  I agree.
-  No Mohawks today?
Oh, you want to cut the hair?
Is that what you're trying to do?
- No, I want to cut the hair.
-  Oh, no.
Put those down, Cal.
-  Mommy's a professional
Hey there mister man (laughs)
I was going to show you
the kids' haircuts but
we got them to bed because
they were ready for bed
but this is my haircut, looks pretty good,
but there's something
even more important and
cool that I want to show you.
Actually I'm not sure if it's cool
or if it's embarrassing, but,
the story goes like this:
Exactly one year ago,
someone showed up to my door.
They knocked on the door and said
"Hey, we have a delivery for Jared Mecham"
I looked outside, and lo and
behold, it was Dr. Pepper.
Dr. Pepper came to my
house with a delivery
with a pallet full of Dr. Pepper cases.
One year ago today.
And I'd like to show you
what remains after one year
of Dr. Pepper consumption and giving away.
So what we did, what Ellie and I did,
any time we had a party,
any time we went somewhere
to visit someone,
we gave them a case of Dr. Pepper.
So, more than half of those Dr. Peppers
were given away and then the rest of them
were used here at parties,
and me editing late at night
falling asleep with Dr.
Pepper, that sounded weird.
Anyway, this is what I have left
after one full year of Dr. Pepper.
Boom.
Four cases.
I actually have probably a case,
maybe a case and a half
upstairs in my office,
But one year ago, we had this whole wall
full of Dr. Pepper, and
that is what's left.
I'm going to insert a
picture from Instagram
where I had it, because it was like
the same week as the Super Bowl,
which was perfect timing because we had
another Super Bowl party last year
and we had tons of Dr. Pepper.
But I'll put the Instagram picture here
and if you guys aren't
following me on Instagram,
I'll have a link to it
here, just follow me,
Jared Mecham, but this is the picture
of me in my Dr. Pepper throne.
But I have to say, thank you Dr. Pepper,
that was the coolest surprise that anyone
could ever get from Dr. Pepper.
Except for maybe that one time
that girl got the fountain,
the Dr. Pepper fountain,
that was pretty cool.
Like I said, I'm not sure
if that's embarrassing
or cool that we have that much Dr. Pepper?
I think Dr. Pepper noticing our
conversations is pretty cool.
You know, today I had some
big expectations with Calvin
and potty training with the potty watch.
I really thought that
he would really take ahold of
this and this would be like
the best potty training helper ever,
and he liked it, and he
did a good job with it.
But it just seemed like
whenever I was with him and everything,
it just didn't really work out
He just didn't really want to as much.
But where I found out like the key
to like breaking through with
Calvin and potty training
is when Ellie was around.
- (laughs)
- Any time that Calvin was
with Ellie, he would go potty.
If it was with me he
was like "Nope, sorry"
- Well and I gotta give
credit to Jackson too
because every time the watch went off,
Jackson would go, "Calvin! Yay!"
- Yeah.
- and he was, Jackson's more
excited about it than Calvin
and that makes Calvin excited.
So, there was a few times that Calvin was
just done for the night and we
we are just going very slow.
He is doing 10 times better
than he was 10 days ago
so I'm just going to tell myself,
If we can get him on the
potty a few times a day,
I am so happy, and today
he only had one accident
so I'm very proud of him.
- And like the thing with potty training
you cannot force them.
Like they won't do it,
you can't force them,
it has to be a decision that they make
and that is where this has helped
he's so excited about it
because Jackson's excited about it
and it's a cyclical thing
but the other thing is like
this is nice because it
has timers for 30 minutes,
60 minutes and 90 minutes,
we had it set to 30 minutes because
we just didn't want to
miss any opportunity
but I can't figure out how to turn it off
it's 10 o'clock and this is
going off every 30 minutes
- Put it in your office for the night
- I know seriously like stuff it
under the pillow in my office
- Who else is potty training right now
and they're doing it, just,
they're on their phone?
I have so many friends, Julie, Jen,
and neighbors, like everyone's
potty training right now.
A lot of people just put
alarms on their phones
I haven't done that and that's
actually been nice for me
because I'm like, oh it's
been 30 minutes, yeah, Calvin
- You know the one thing Siri
is good for is setting alarms.
I don't know how Apple's keeping up,
they're not keeping up
with the competition like
Alexa and Google Assistant
are kicking Apple's butt.
I don't know how the Home
Pod is even going to compete.
Because, anyway, that's
totally off subject but,
I've got to figure out
how to turn this off.
- He looks so cute wearing it.
- Yeah he does, he really, really does.
He really does look cute
with his little watch on.
- You can tell I'm like, ready for bed
Every kid is so different
with potty training.
With Calvin so far, the things
that have helped the most with us,
is getting him his own small potty
and the potty watch like even though,
(laughs) that's going off,
even though we just got it today,
I would say those are the two things
that I've enjoyed the most and side note,
obviously getting some
prizes when he goes potty
he really likes that, not candy,
he likes getting like a small prize.
So that's what we have loved the most
and then obviously just them
wanting to go on their own
if he doesn't need to
go, he gets flustered,
and then I've learned not
to even push it and just
continue to go even 10
minutes later ask again, so.
That's what's helped me the
most, and Calvin the most.
- I think just having you
around has helped Calvin
- And having me around,
and Jackson's so excited.
Thank you guys so much for
watching our Vlog today
we're going to keep on keeping
on with potty training, guys
thank you guys so much and
we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye!
