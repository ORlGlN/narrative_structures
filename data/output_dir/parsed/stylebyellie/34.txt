- Two things of good news.
What?
(laughing)
I am not that type of vlogger.
♪ I want to break free ♪
- Call me a miser, call me a wizard,
call me a fortune teller,
anything that you want.
Because I called it, I called it.
It's snowing.
Grrrr, I knew this was gonna happen.
I knew that we would get snow.
Just as soon as things started to warm up,
we got snow.
And apparently, it's going to be snowing
the entire day.
There's like a 50% chance
of snow all day long.
And what that means is that probably
throughout the rest of the week,
we'll probably have little
things of snow here or there.
And the thing that is the
worst part about that,
it's not even like okay
we're gonna get dumped on
or nothing, it's like I don't know,
it's either gonna be some,
it's not gonna be a lot,
but it'll just be there a little bit
the rest of the week, and
I'm done with the snow.
Snow, I'm done with you.
I think Ellie and I are
gonna move to Arizona.
Uh-oh, you guys are all in handcuffs.
Who did something naughty today?
- Who's in trouble?
You're in trouble?
Well this is gonna teach you to behave.
-  Mom's in trouble?
Uh-oh.
- This is to make you
stand by my side all day.
This is the best punishment
you'll ever receive.
-  No one wants to
stay next to Mom all day long.
- I actually don't know
what the heck I'm doing.
-  This is some sort of game
that you guys are playing.
I wanted to come down here
and complain about the snow.
- Oh brrr, it's fine.
-  Hey, did you
see that it was snowing?
- It is cold, but we'll just stay inside
for a few more then.
- Yeah.
- But you know what?
I'm gonna have to plow the driveway.
And that's the fun part.
Do you guys want to ride
the four-wheeler with me
and plow the driveway later today?
- No.
- Oh okay.
(laughing)
Rejected.
- Okay, try your key.
Perfect, just like that.
Yep, put it all the way in.
You need the key?
- Mmm-hmm.
- I don't know what I'm doing,
we're just playing.
-  You're just kinda playing,
making up your own rules as you go?
- Yep, where's your key?
- I swallowed it.
You guys aren't escaping.
- You don't even have it.
♪ I want to break free ♪
-  Is it working bud?
-  Yes.
(Jared gasps)
-  You're free!
- I'm free, I'm free!
Dangit.
-  You're free, you're free!
-  Now do it.
- That's his free dance.
-  Alright now
are you guys gonna go
try and make your bed?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, go make your bed.
- We need these parts.
-  Okay go try and make your bed
with your handcuffs on.
So far so good.
Try and make your bed.
- You make it.
-  No I'm gonna watch you.
I'll help on this side.
And you go on that side and pull it.
And we'll see how Calvin does.
Oh good job Calvin, you're
getting your blanket on.
This'll help me keep you guys
from running all over the house.
- Hey.
-  Okay grab the
sheet Calvin, see this?
Grab the sheet.
(yelling)
Grab it, pull it up.
Oh good job.
Grab this side.
Grab this side.
Oh, oh no.
Hey, you guys are doing pretty dang good.
Calvin you sound like a gremlin.
- No.
-  Careful with Calvin, Jacks.
Careful with Calvin.
Oh no not your little arm, you're free!
- Go pee first.
- Oh you go pee.
Good job buddy.
We were out yesterday for Valentine's Day
and I asked, should we get a HomePod?
The majority of you guys,
like 90% of you guys said yes.
So we got one, I'm going to unbox it
and give my initial impressions.
But my initial impressions
or my secondary impressions
of these flowers are kind of sad.
Ellie you're flowers are drooping.
Let's go take one to her.
Does this look sad?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, let's go show Mom.
Hi Mom, working hard?
- Hi.
- I don't know how this happened
but there's popcorn and
bananas all over in here.
-  Well it's a kitchen
and you know, there's food.
- Well I know,
but the kids forgot to
clean their kitchen.
-  Aww, we need to
get them on their chores.
I wanted to show you this.
It's so sad looking.
We got those yesterday.
Aww, now you made it happy.
(whack)
(Jared yells)
- It okay little guy, you just sit in here
with the other stuff.
-  Ooh.
(Ellie laughs)
Waa waa waa waa.
What are you doing?
- Give Mom this rose.
-  You're gonna give Mom a rose?
Okay, we'll be so quiet.
- Aww, did you get me a flower?
This one has thorns on it.
This is a pretty one.
-  That is a pretty one.
- You want to smell it?
Did you potty in the toilet?
Good job.
You can have it and this one's sharp.
Careful.
- He did it all by himself.
- Hey careful.
- Go put it back.
Look at him being so careful.
Alright so I just filmed the video
of the unboxing, my initial impressions.
One major thing that I forgot to say
on the video was that,
when I listen to the HomePod,
it feels like I'm wearing headphones.
It sounds good enough that
I'm wearing headphones.
I can hear all of the
intricacies of the song.
We're listening to The
Greatest Showman right now.
♪ It's taking over you ♪
♪ This is the greatest show ♪
♪ It's everything you ever want ♪
♪ It's everything you ever need ♪
- So I just walked in Jared's office
to ask him a question
and you moved Miss Penny.
But look at your little brown nose.
Penny, what were you in?
What did you get in?
Did you get in the fire pit?
Did you play in our leftover fire.
(Ellie laughs)
Jared, look at her nose.
- She is like a chimney sweep.
-  Did you play, huh?
She's tired.
-  Yeah, she's been playing hard.
She's been playin'.
-  You're tired.
She moved to her little bed.
- She never sits on her bed, but look,
she's sitting there.
-  Yeah.
-  She's finally
getting used to it.
- You like it, it's comfy.
- Yeah.
-  Okay you got to bed, okay?
Then we're gonna look at family names.
- That's a great idea.
- Two things of good news,
one, Calvin has not had
any accidents today,
woo hoo.
- Woo hoo!
- And two, we are sitting down together
looking at some family history.
We are just looking at family names
just to continue our search,
just to see if anything
else sparks an interest for baby Mecham.
Jackson just suggested that
if the baby is not Mason,
his name shall be Cody Shark Dee Dee.
So Cody Shark Dee Dee?
If you are not Mason, you
will be Cody Shark Dee Dee.
- I think that's a good strong name.
- Especially Shark, I like it.
So we are just gonna look at FamilySearch?
Is that what we're looking under?
- Yeah, so this has all
of my family history
as far as we've gone back.
If you guys remember, we
did the whole DNA thing.
Ancestry DNA,
- Yeah.
- So this is all tied together,
has all of our family as far back
as far back as I can remember.
- But you have it in
there if a family member
has updated it, is that correct?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like your mom, like Jared's mom
is very big into family
history and genealogy.
And so she goes online at FamilySearch.org
and does all this stuff.
- So we're gonna see if
we can find any names
that just kind of like, oh yeah or no or--
- Can other people see
other peoples' stuff?
- I'm not sure how far
you can look into it.
- 'Cause that's kinda weird.
- Yeah, I'm not sure.
- Betty, ah that's cute.
- Betty Lou Cole.
- That's cute, not a girl though.
- Well that's my grandma,
but we're not having a girl.
- That's cute, that's what I meant.
- Should we look on my mom's side
or my dad's side?
- Let's look on all of our sides.
- All of the sides.
-  Got it, Leonidas.
-  Look, his son's
name was Leonidas too.
Americus, wow.
That was so funny.
Okay so, Joseph, William,
Johann, Gottlieb,
John Bahls.
(laughing)
- Jackson's laughing.
- Mary Bahls?
Hey it's my family,
I can make fun of them, right?
- Calvin,
- Okay so far we're really
not seeing anything.
- Elvira?
- Charles if probably my
favorite that I've seen on here.
But still, nothing beats--
- Nothing's really just
jumping out at us right now.
- It's just weird, because
Mason is the very first thing
that I even looked at and said
and then it's just clicked since.
We've talked, we've been very open,
we love the name Mason,
that's probably what his name will be,
we just want to really
make sure, you know?
Is that okay to say?
- I think that's okay to say,
but it may not be true.
(laughs)
- It is true.
- We'll see.
- Let's keep looking.
What's the first name you liked?
-  Cody what?
- Cody Shark Dee Dee.
-  Cody Shark Dee Dee.
-  I don't know.
- Okay, here's the thing,
if this video gets 25,000--
-  Oh boo, no we're not!
- We will name our baby
Cody Shark Dee Dee.
(laughing)
- I am not that type of vlogger, no no no.
- Oh my gosh, that was be so bad,
but seriously if you do it, we will.
- No we won't, no we won't.
(laughing)
- My dad's family history, my dad's line
goes all the way back to 1448.
We know their names.
-  John Meacham
at the time was the name.
- Yeah, M-E-A-C-H-A-M.
-  That's crazy.
- Isn't that cool?
What year is it?
Over 600 years, or, 600 years.
- Calvin?
Sorry Jackson.
You need to leave him alone
when he's in the bathroom.
- So my mom.
-  My mom.
- Had her dad.
-  My dad.
- Had his mom had her mom--
-  Her mom, my mom.
- Had her mom, had her dad,
had her dad,
- My Dad.
- Had her mom, had her dad,
had her dad, had her dad,
had her mom mom's sister,
had her son,
- My mom.
had his son, had his son,
had his son, had his son,
- My son.
had his daughter, had his son,
who had a kid named Mason.
- What?
(laughing)
Jared!
- I found a link.
(laughing)
Look at this.
Look at this.
Okay, so here's me,
generation one two three
four five six seven eight nine,
10, 11, 12 back, over one,
one two three four five six seven eight.
(laughing)
So that's okay, that's
fourth cousin once removed?
- When we were sitting down,
Jared's like well i guess if
we have a Mason in the family,
it'll just reaffirm
that it is to be Mason.
That's hilarious.
- Let us be clear real quick
This is not official.
This is not official.
You have to agree with me on this.
This is not official.
We don't know for sure yet.
- I would say 99%.
- Okay there's still a chance
it might change.
- Yes,
- Absolutely, and we're
both on the same page.
We're doing this, but that's hilarious.
(playful guitar music)
The menu tonight is taco salads
and the menu tomorrow,
we're gonna do homemade
Chinese food Jared.
-  Ooh yeah.
- We're gonna try.
We have a list of baby names
that we have officially have written down
that we're gonna continue to look through.
Mason's at the top of the list.
I think a lot of the others
would go really smooth as middle names.
It's getting really fun.
-  Yeah.
- And I liked going through
all of our family names,
because it reassured
how I'm already feeling.
- So a lot of these names
aren't surprises to you.
We've talked about these before,
but I kinda feel like
these are the top names,
especially this bottom one,
Cody Shark Dee Dee.
Like I said Jackson, 25,000.
-  No.
- No.
-  Okay you're right.
- Do you like Cody?
Or do you like Mason?
- Cody!
Cody Shark Dee Dee.
-  See Ellie, he wants it too.
-  What did you say?
- I'm liking it now.
-  You like it now?
You're even eating lettuce, good job.
Mine definitely looks the best.
Everyone else's is very plain.
Just like you like it Jared.
- Very plain Jane, 'cause I stay sane,
if you know what I mean.
As our evening is coming to a wrap up,
we have a project that we're
going to be working on.
I know, another project for us,
this is insane, I don't
know what we're thinking.
So we are gonna go through
all of our hard drives.
We're going to go through
all of our computers
and we're going to
compile all of the photos
that we've taken over the past,
I don't know, 10 years or so?
- This is crazy.
- Like 15 or 20,000 pictures.
- We have to do it now though,
like I told Jared, I'm like I want a book,
a baby Jackson book, baby Calvin book,
toddler books, a Penny book,
the house building process book,
I want those organized
and I'm just like I need to do it while,
one, we have energy,
the kids are happy right
now, we should start.
So we're starting the process.
- Right now we're actually updating
both of our laptop computers
to a new operating system,
so we can download an
app to help us do this.
I figure this is gonna
take us a long time,
so Ellie I brought this for you,
so you can use it,
- Thanks.
-  While you go through--
- Chocolate and a massage, yes, thanks.
- Thousands and thousands
and thousands of photos.
So we're gonna print some of the pictures,
because we're gonna probably use chapbooks
for some of the pictures,
but a lot of them we're
actually going to be printing
actual pictures for an actual photo album,
where you put 'em in the slides.
- I had tweeted it and
I had a few people ask,
I'd love to do that, what's the process?
So I thought maybe if Jared explained
the process, because we're overwhelmed,
but if you explain it,
maybe that might help some
people that ask questions.
- Phew, here goes.
So there's a couple
different things that I use
and it would probably be
better to explain this
in front of a computer.
But for time's sake, I'm
just going to do it verbally.
We import all of the pictures that we take
with our camera, this camera right here
with our vlog,
our phone cameras and any other devices.
The computer recognizes that and uses it
to import it into the
photos app on our Macs.
We have a few different libraries
from all of the different
computers that we've had
and we're using an application
called Power Photos
that allows us to merge the libraries,
and see if there's any duplicates.
And take care of those.
Once we have all of that done,
and we're in one single library,
Ellie is going to take all of those photos
and organize them into the
photos that she mentioned.
Then, once that is done,
she is going to mark them
with priority, the highest
priority will probably
have actual physical photos printed
and we'll go from there.
So it's pretty easy when
you say it like that,
but it's going to take
a very very long time.
But I love Google Photos,
because it keeps free unlimited backup
of all of your photos.
So all of my photos on my phone
are automatically synced to Google Photos.
Whenever we plug in our phones,
it's automatically backed
up to the photos app,
so those are two quick easy ways
to back up and sync photos.
Phew, I hope that made sense.
Now that I've said that,
I want to ask you, what is
your photo organization?
With digital photos, we
can snap as much as we want
and we kind of do it willy nilly
and organization is
always the hardest part.
What do you guys do to
organize your photos?
- Another day, the kids are in bed
and the bath is going to be started.
When we went to Lush yesterday,
I don't know if you guys
realized how big these are.
They said that they came out
with one during the holidays,
but it was just online.
Bath bomb is humongo, this is my face.
It's huge!
So I'm going to take a
big ole bath right now.
I'm trying to put it down
softly, so I don't break it.
I'm gonna take a bath.
We have thousands of photos uploading.
I can't wait to make
some books for my kids
and so that I have them forever.
Those are some of my
favorite items I have.
Jared made me a pregnancy book.
I have these books from when I was a kid.
We have tons of books downstairs.
Just of pictures,
but it's been 10 years since
we've organized photos.
Jared and I have never really organized
all of our photos.
It's a lot of photos to go through,
especially when you have two kids
and pregnancies that you--
and a dog that you have
taken pictures galore, so.
Organizing our life one day at a time,
so thank you guys for watching.
And we'll see you tomorrow, bye.
