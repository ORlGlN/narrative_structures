- I don't care if your foot's numb.
I am going to great lengths
to make this video happen.
-  Did he see us?
- (whispering) No.
- That's a weird sound. What is that?
- Ellie threw out all of my clothes.
(laughing)
- Good morning, boys.
How are you this morning?
- Good.
-  Good. Jackson,
did you know that today
you're getting your
pictures taken at preschool?
- Yeah.
- You look very, very sharp today.
What are you gonna wear
during your pictures?
- You wanna wear your sunglasses?
Let's see them on, bud.
Yeah, buddy. Give me a cool pose.
(laughing)
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, you saw it here first.
That is a cool pose, huh Cal?
Okay, let's go to school.
Show me your cool walk to the car.
Yeah, buddy. Doing our
cool walk to the car.
Okay, buddy, show me your
best preschool smile.
Thumbs up and everything.
One more. One big smile.
There we go, that's my boy.
You have a wonderful day at school today.
I love you very much.
- Hey, a fire hydrant.
- Good job. All right,
it's closing. We're home.
Are we home? Whose house is this?
- Mine
- Is this your house?
- My house.
- I don't care if your foot's numb.
I am going to great lengths
to make this video happen.
I am a great producer, okay?
- We are doing a hair tutorial.
-  Wait, did you just
say, "Be a goddess," Bonnie?
Girls. Goddess mode.
- Stop looking like such a frump.
- Stop touching your hair.
It's annoying in every video.
- So, what we have, we're doing the,
or they're doing the hair tutorial video.
We grabbed the extension cord,
we grabbed the power strip,
they've got all of their curling stuff,
we grabbed this giant
mirror so they could see.
The giant mirror was
slipping so we grabbed this
to keep it up, but then the
bottom kept slipping out,
so we grabbed this and
propped it up against that.
This tripod wasn't working,
so we got the bar stool.
The bar stool is hum, so we
put the book underneath it,
and I tilted it just down a little bit,
and now we've got our shot.
- It smells like burning hair spray.
-  Yes, it does.
Okay, I'm gonna hit play.
Sound speed.
- Action.
-  Give us a good clap.
(clapping)
- No just one good clap.
(laughing)
Okay, I'll do the clap.
- Here, I got the clap.
(laughing)
-  Did we get that? We got it.
Action.
I just got out of the
shower, because you guys know
that I was a little stinky,
and my hair was a disaster,
it still is a disaster, but
I'm listening to Moondance.
I heard it in the car, and I haven't heard
this song in such a long time.
I used to play it in jazz band
when I was in middle school, or something.
One of my favorite songs.
Van Morrison does a great job with it.
Michael Buble does a good job with it.
Lots of people do a good job with it,
but that's not the point I want to make.
I weighed myself on the
scale, and you guys know
a few videos ago, Ellie
threw out all of my clothes.
We donated all of them,
and I haven't been drinking Dr. Pepper.
I still love Dr. Pepper, but
I haven't been drinking it.
I've been drinking water
and carbonated water.
I stepped on the scale, and
it's only been two weeks or so,
but I've lost six pounds,
and I was just like
that's incredible to me.
I was so stunned and shocked by that.
Six pounds, that's pretty significant
by making one small change
like that, so, I don't know.
I think I should recognize
a little victory like that,
and I can't wait to
continue doing that forward.
By the way, Ryan and
I had this discussion.
He said, "La Croix and
Bubly taste the exact same,"
and then he had Bubly.
Tasted quite a bit better.
I've been drinking Bubly,
and I kind of like it.
If you have any other drinks that you like
that are really healthy, let me know
in the comments down below.
Other than water, of course.
(upbeat music)
- We are done.
After, like, 30 phone calls,
we finally have our last photo shoot
done.
- And scheduled.
That was difficult getting
everyone scheduled.
- My calendar looks, like, trashed.
- Now we need to find something to wear.
- I think one of the hardest
things about the cookbook
is getting everyone
scheduled on the same page.
There are five kids in Ellie's family
and then Ellie's parents,
so you're working with
seven couples, trying to get
everything on the same day,
the same time, the same
outfit, the same food,
the same recipes, all
of that all together,
but the last photo shoot
is finally scheduled.
- And babies are coming, so
we have to plan around babies.
-  Yes, so bring
lots of extra outfits.
- It's our birthday month next month.
- That's what you meant.
I thought you meant just the
kids in our family are coming.
No, we have three babies in
our family that are coming
that we have to have this done before.
This baby, Julie's baby and Emily's baby.
Can you believe that?
Speaking of babies, we've
got a bump box over there
that you need to open.
That's a weird. What is that?
Do you guys hear that?
It's water, but it's louder than normal.
Oh my gosh, Penny and I are on a walk.
Penny, let's go, and we're here
right when they turned on all the water.
Look, it's coming down
the stream right now.
This is crazy.
This is the first day of Spring,
and look, all of this is dry.
This is a little creek
that they're going through,
but look, the water's
coming down right now.
They opened up.
Penny, do you see the water?
Do you see it? There it is.
Oh my gosh, what perfect timing.
Get it, Penny, get it!
Good girl. How cool is this?
What do you think, Penny?
Is that pretty cool?
-  Pregnant person!
Hi baby. Holy shiz.
(laughing)
Your belly.
Oh
my
gosh.
There's mine.
Julie, oh my gosh, yours
is, Lucy, good heavens girl.
- I know, she's taking a toll on me.
- Julie, your belly is, I
think it just crazy popped
since last I saw you.
- You're so cute.
- First, Julie looks beautiful.
I can't believe you have a
basketball in your stomach.
We're looking at bags because
Julie's trying to find a bag.
This is the cutest bag. I like it.
- I think I like them to be
able to go over my shoulder
just so I don't have to
worry about keeping it
up on my shoulder.
- Pregnancy mamas are
here, and Albion was doing,
they sent an Instagram out the other day
that they were doing a
bath bomb making night,
and I signed up right away,
and I texted all the girls.
I said, "If you can come,
come, if you can't, you can't,"
and we got the best of us here.
(upbeat music)
Bathology has come to Albion
and we have bath bombs,
and we are mixing a ton of scents,
and we are creating our
own scents for them.
This is right up my alley, and
I need to take it all home.
They gave us a pamphlet that
you can buy your own products,
have your own scents on them,
and I'm just like in heaven.
- Listen here, sonny.
You are back from school, and
you had picture day today.
Can you show me what you
did for your pictures?
Stand up for me. Stand up.
Stand up, young son.
(laughing)
You gotta stand up or I'll keep tickling.
(playful screaming)
Are you gonna stand up?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Show me what you did for your
picture in preschool today.
- I said.
-  Oh beautiful.
That's what you did for your picture?
Did you do anything else?
Did you take more than one picture?
- I did.
- Oh my goodness.
Mama's gonna be so happy
to see that picture
and have it immortalized forever
for your second preschool picture ever.
That was a good picture.
Hey, do you guys wanna know something?
Hey, hey, hey.
(laughing)
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's go do that to Calvin.
We gotta sneak up on him.
Did he see us?
- No.
- Okay, let's go, let's go.
- Okay.
- He's so unsuspecting.
- You come with me.
-  Yeah, I'm coming.
I don't think he's seen you yet.
He spotted you. Tickle him!
Tickle him! Tickle him!
Tickle him! Tickle him!
(laughing)
Hey boys, guess what, guess what?
Here's what I'm thinking.
Mom is at a class right now.
She's doing something fun
for her and her sisters.
It is just us boys tonight,
and you know what that means?
We get to have a little
party. Pizza party.
Do you guys want pizza for dinner?
- Yeah!
-  Calvin, do you
want pizza for dinner?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, can I borrow some money?
Thank you. I'm just gonna
borrow this for pizza, okay?
Can I borrow this for pizza tonight?
- Can I have some coins?
-  I'm gonna take that as a yes.
You're just gonna take the
whole register. Perfect.
Ta-da.
Are you guys ready to dig in?
- Yeah, but there's no cheese.
- There's lot of cheese on that.
Lots of cheese and pepperoni.
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, hey
we need to wash your hands,
say a prayer, cut these
into little slices,
and then you can have some, okay, bud?
Thank you very much.
Okay it makes sense.
The kids are in bed, and
Ellie is on her way home,
so that is where we are
going to end our night.
Thank you so much for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up,
and we will see you guys next time.
Bye.
