(jingle)
-  Happy
Thanksgiving everyone!
(laughter)
Go get it!
Catch it!
Yeah!
(everyone chattering)
-  Kevin gets to say prayer.
- Wow, wee! Wee!
- Are you silly? Uh huh?
-  Why are you so silly?
- We are, he's getting dressed.
He's like help, I'm so cold.
Let's, I have an idea.
Let's keep you warm
while we get you dressed.
(chuckles)
So now that your arms are in the blanket--
-  You gotta be quick, mom!
- Let's put your head in, now
let's do your arm, one arm--
-  Just one!
Get it! Quick, quick, quick, quick!
- And usually Jackson
gets dressed everyday,
so that gives me an excuse to help him
-  Did I tell
you that he got himself
dressed, yesterday?
- I know, and everyday.
Almost everyday he gets
himself dressed, huh?
But, don't forget your underwear!
- That's happened one time (chuckles).
Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Hey, hey, what's under here?
-  Go in your
tunnel, happy Thanksgiving!
-  Mr. Calvin, Jackson
wore this shirt last year.
Can you believe it fits you (laughter)?
Is there something on your lip?
Okay, look at you handsome buddy!
Jackson, let's see you!
Wow, you guys clean up nice!
Can you stand by Jax, Cal?
Let's see yah! Wow!
Are you guys gonna be good today?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  It's Thanksgiving!
- Yeah!
-  Do you know what Thanksgiving is?
- Yeah.
-  What?
- Giving!
- It's about giving?
- Yeah.
-  Remember, we're
gonna be a family today?
And we're gonna say
what we're thankful for.
We're gonna pick our noses.
- Why are we gonna pick noses?
(giggles)
-  We're gonna wash our hands.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, okay?
We'll play in grandma
and grandpa's backyard.
Play with the football, and
the tramp, and the swing,
and the playhouse, with our cousins.
- No, our tree house.
-  And the tree house.
What are you wanting to do?
- Trying to do my letter book.
-  Your letter book?
- Yeah.
- Aw, that made me so happy!
We're getting ready to
go down to the galley
for Thanksgiving.
Jared's getting ready, we're
getting everyone and Penny
packed up.
Here's your letter
book, you want a marker.
- I marker too.
-  You wanna color too?
- Yeah.
- Come here. Jump on down.
- Blue.
-  You want blue?
- No, Mommy boo.
(giggles)
-  You're so cute!
Um, here, we'll play with this.
I have a coloring sheet and
a Bingo page that I found
on Pinterest, that I want to print out.
But while dad's getting
everything ready, we're gonna
sit here, and he wants
to do his letter book,
and we are gonna color.
- Bounce, counce, poo poo,
poo poo one more time...
-  Is that the poo poo song?
- Yeah.
-  Wow!
- I'm gonna do the stink song.
-  Okay, let's hear it.
- Stink stink butt butt.
-  Awe!
- No, not the live
turkey, the dead turkey.
- The cooked turkey, the delicious turkey.
(chuckles) Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
(laughter)
I thought when we played that
the other day, I was like,
oh there's a live turkey
and a cooked turkey,
how do we explain this?
(laughter)
- Okay, let's do the green
leaf and the yellow leaf.
- Bingo! Bingo!
- What?
- Olivia with the first Bingo
of the Thanksgiving Dinner
celebration!
(other kids screaming)
- Good girl!
- All have blackout,
this is out second round.
-  Oh my gosh.
- We'll keep going.
-  Did you guys eat
all the goldfish too once
you got a blackout?
-  No, no!
- That's my favorite part of the game.
-  I did, I did, me!
-  Russel knows how
to play, and Cody knows how
to play.
We just got to Ellie's parent's
house for the Thanksgiving
Day Celebration and we have
our, the family's kind of
divided up into different quadrants.
We've got the kids playing Bingo.
We've got some of the
guys watching Football.
We've got the table over
here, and where the magic
happens, grandma and grandpa with
all the turkey.
- It's Penny!
-  Lincoln, do you see Penny?
- He outside.
- Oh fun! Yes we brought Penny, along.
- Where's Penny?
-  Do you want to go say hi to Penny?
- There, I see Penny!
- Penny is just dying over
this new ball, she loves it.
I think that's the win from
her anniversary celebration.
Lincoln and I wanted to
come out and see Penny,
and throw the ball for her.
Do you want to throw the ball for her?
Yeah, if she'll let it up,
we can throw it for her.
That's the hardest part of
the game, is getting the ball
from the dog.
She's got one side of fetch
down, but the other half,
you know, giving it back,
that's the difficult part.
Oh, you're so fast, Penny!
Guys, we got the ball, we got the ball!
Let's throw it for her!
Ready Penny? Ready?
Go get it!
- Is that her favorite ball?
-  I think that's
her new favorite ball!
Yay, okay! Catch it!
Yeah (laughter)!
I try to pretend to be!
- You're not pretending
Ellie, this is you.
He wants to throw it?
- Okay, throw it to mom?
Come on throw it to me, I'll catch it!
-  He's running down
the pipe, he's going down the
field, he dodges, he
tackles left and right,
what's he gonna do? He's gonna
pass the 20, the 10, the 5!
Can he make it all the way?
- Throw it, hurry, I'll catch it!
Throw it!
-  Lateral, yeah!
Oh, so close.
-  Do you have a name tag?
Okay, Jackson, Cody,
Russel, and this is Calvin
and Lincoln right here.
That's where mom used to have to sit.
- I'm putting Porter
up here too he's good.
-  Good! Good!
So usually how this works
is the kids will eat,
and then go off and play.
The adults will sit and
eat and end up talking
for a long time.
Where are you gonna sit?
You know what, Aunt Linda?
Right here, mom.
Yeah, yep, this is where I
figured you might want to sit.
Want me to pull it out?
-  Yeah!
(silence - audio missing)
- I think this might be our
first year with three tables.
Last time we had more than
three tables, was when all
my aunts and uncles and cousins came.
Baby, baby table right there
for moving all the kids,
middle kids right here, grown ups there.
-  Stop
hitting, don't you hit.
Stop hitting, don't you know
you're suppose to be really
nice and respectful and happy?
You stop, you grr...
(laughter)
Did you just feed Penny?
- Yeah, we have her some turkey dinner.
She's such a good girl.
-  She looks very happy.
-  Yeah, hey! Whoa!
A little too happy.
- Where's Kevin?
(chatter)
- Digging for gold.
(chatter)
-  Kevin gets to say the prayer.
- Kevin has to say the prayer.
(chatter)
-  Yeah, I had a lot of
people tell me they couldn't--
- He's just waiting--
-  To play?
- Yeah, to play.
Look at his cousins.
(snoring)
-  He literally
laid day two seconds ago.
(giggles)
What the heck?
(laughter) Is he being silly, Aunt Linda?
She is so happy right now!
-  Oh, she is loving life right now!
Throw it Jackson!
-  Unlimited amount of balls.
- Let's go, let's go!
-  Hey Jax!
-  Are you playing
Thanksgiving football?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we all are!
-  Penny will get it!
She's so fast.
(chatter and kids yelling)
(laughter)
- Who!
-  Penny, we're
gonna wear you out girl!
- There's no stick, I'm smarter!
- You are!
(laughter)
- At least my kid agrees with me.
Everyone else in the world may not.
- It's fun!
This is fun!
- Are you hiding the ball from Penny?
- Yeah!
- Wanna go play Football?
- Uh-huh!
- Just watch!
- (singing) Wee! Wow! Wee! Wee!
Our ball, the ball!
Wee! Wee!
- Mom likes baby!
(rawrs)
No, be nice. Look, be nice.
Say mama, you're gonna make me cry.
- Oh, mommy.
Nice baby.
- Say mama's baby.
- Mommy's baby!
- He always pets my face,
guys, and goes mama's baby!
You are my baby!
And so is Jackson!
(yelling in background)
You did, you caught it?
- Yep!
- Okay, let's see you throw it!
-  Jackson!
-  Woo hoo!
And Penny's my baby!
(laughter) she's so tired.
-  Mommy's baby.
-  Alright, here's
what I want you to do.
K, you're gonna line up to
my right, okay, once you get
to the trampoline, you're
gonna do a diagonal
to the fence.
That's the play, okay?
It's called a slant.
- Hurry, Penny's not watching.
Go, go, go!
-  Go, go, go!
- No!
-  Oh! The defense
was there, but the offense
was no where to be found.
Okay, let's run that play again, mom.
- Just throw it!
-  Yay! Mom!
- I think I can--
- She's so tired, she's not trying.
(chuckles)
-  Are you tired?
Are you just gonna sit there in place?
She's oh gees.
I can't keep up anymore.
Oh man.
- Are you having a good day?
- Yeah.
-  Good!
You're getting a little close!
- Jax acted perfect at dinner.
He's like Thanksgiving's my favorite.
We get together for Christmas,
but, there's something
special about today, because
we're getting together
just to see each other.
-  Just family.
That's all that's here.
- No other distractions.
- Distractions.
- This is fun, just hanging out.
-  Dad said it best.
Penny come.
-  Come out here!
Get out here, stop talking!
I can see you talking, you're ignoring me.
They're all sitting in
the window just looking.
Get out here!
- Well it only took an open
swing to convince you guys
to come out here and
move the party over here.
Watch out, oh gees!
Emma's double trouble.
You guys having fun?
Having a happy Thanksgiving?
- I am!
-  You are?
- I'm not.
-  Awe.
Well we should probably fix that somehow.
Penny! (laughter)
Let's try again!
Good throw, ready?
Hold your arms out?
Yeah! You caught it!
Good job, bud!
Go deep.
-  He's like, what?
(chuckles)
-  Um, Penny was, what the?
Where's Penny?
How did she get out?
Penny! Come here! Come here!
-  The pie is out.
-  Let's go, uh oh.
Come on, come on, come on.
That could have been a
Thanksgiving disaster.
Holy cow! I don't know how she got out!
But we have all this pie.
She definitely has the
incentive to come, break through
her little kennel that we have.
Jeepers.
- I was like bad idea, bad idea, grandma!
-  Don't bring the
pie outside with the dog!
-  We are on a walk.
The whole fam-bamily.
Except mom and dad.
How'd they get out of this?
So we walked to where
this used to be our old
elementary school.
They completely tore it down.
They're making a splash pad.
And then that's the new elementary.
And the boys found rocks.
- Well, how many people did
we have in this house, today?
- Oh dear.
-  Jackson says five.
-  And now there's
only a few remaining.
- Save the best for last.
-  Oh, snap!
-  20 minus 4 here today.
- 25.
25 people, and now there's everyone count,
wait, one, two, three, four, five, six,
less than that.
So, (laughter).
So yeah, we're just
wrapping up our day here.
And, having fun a good Thanksgiving.
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
I had a great Thanksgiving!
Real quick, Jackson, can
you tell me one thing
you're grateful for?
- Loading remote controls with cars.
-  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Joel, what's one thing
you're grateful for.
- Snow.
-  Snow.
Bonnie, what's one thing
you're grateful for.
- Oh, that's so hard.
It's cliche, but I am thankful
for my family, so there.
-  Good, yeah!
What's one thing you're thankful for.
- Everything.
-  Mom, what's one
thing you're thankful for.
- Okay, it is cliche, but it isn't.
Family is everything, and
I'm grateful that my children
get along.
-  Dad, what is one
thing you're grateful for?
- All that they've said,
but I'm really grateful
for 50" dirt trails.
-  Oh!
Olivia, what's one thing
you're grateful for.
- Family.
-  Awe!
Calvin, what's one thing
you're thankful for.
Peppa Pig? Great!
Markers!
Lincoln, what's one thing
you're thankful for?
- Sharks.
-  Sharks? Okay!
Penny, what's one thing
you're thankful for?
Bones!
One thing I'm grateful for,
and it's funny because we're
sitting here, with the lights
down dim, and we're sitting
all in the living room and
we're talking, it takes me back
to the very first time I
sat here in this living room
after Julian Mannon's wedding.
And we all sat here and talked.
I wasn't even apart of the
family, but you guys were my ride
to my aunt and uncle's house.
- The couches were like
this that day, too.
-  Yes, they were.
-  And me and you were right there.
- Uh huh, and I am grateful
that we have the opportunity
and the desire and the conversation.
You know, I like sitting here
and talking with my family.
And I'm glad that I'm
apart of this family.
So that's what I am grateful for.
- Yay! We are too!
I feel like I try and
appreciate my family everyday,
not just like, just Thanksgiving.
But, it was extra
special, you know, it was,
just being together.
Even though we are together,
even though I do get to see
my siblings, it was extra special.
- Yeah, and I mean, it's
not that you aren't grateful
the other days, it's that
you focus on the gratitude,
you know, and you try to
think about all the things
that you're grateful for.
Because, really when it comes
down to it, there are so many
things that we're grateful for.
And we'd don't always talk
about everything that we're
grateful for.
- The biggest thing is
family, because that's like,
the only thing that really
matters to me, and us,
but, I was telling Jared on
the way home, I was like,
I feel like, I everyday try
and make really quality time
with the kids.
And it doesn't have to be a whole day.
But I really do try and like,
a good quality time with them.
And, Calvin really enjoyed
swinging with me today.
Usually he doesn't want that.
He wants to do it himself.
But today, I loved sitting
on the swing till my butt
was numb swinging him.
- He just like laid in on you, snuggled--
- He was loving on me.
- And he would not let
go of that football.
- No, he won't.
And Jackson, he loved playing the game.
He loved bingo.
And then the rest of the
time he wanted nothing to do
with anyone but his
cousins, which was perfect.
You know, he just wanted to play.
- Oh, him and Boston
were loving life today.
- Which is interesting,
because usually him and Boston,
sometimes--
- Yeah, they clash a little bit.
- Butt heads.
- And Jackson wants to play with Cody.
But, I finally fell like
Jackson and Boston have realized
that they're like--
- They're friends.
- We can be friends!
We like the same things!
- They held hands
on the walk.
- It was so cute.
- I'm grateful for a lot of things.
I'm grateful that we were
able to go to another part
of the world, and see how a
whole other part of the world
lives, it makes me grateful
for what I have here.
I'm grateful for what we have.
I'm grateful for my family.
I'm grateful for a roof over our head.
My mom said she was grateful
that our family got together
and spent all day together.
She's like, some families don't have that.
Some families they can't.
Some families, they don't want to.
Or, like, I'm grateful for that.
I'm grateful to see my friends
spend time with their family.
- Yeah, like it's fun to have
our family get together and--
- It was enjoyable seeing
my siblings and having pie,
and Aunt Linda was the life
of the party, Aunt Linda
we love being with you.
- She was so sweet.
Everyone who walked through
the front door, she was there
to greet them.
And she gave them a big hug.
She was very tender.
She was excited to have a party.
It was fun.
I mean, there are so many
things I'm grateful for too,
and it's while we were in China.
So, speaking of China, I'm
gonna make my sermon pretty
quick here.
While we were in China, we
met Richie and Natalie Norton.
Natalie was talking about
like, radical gratitude.
Being grateful for some things
that you normally wouldn't
be grateful for, because you
haven't seen what the gratitude
is yet.
She lost her phone on the trip,
and she's like, I'm grateful
I lost my phone because I
wouldn't have experienced it
the same way I did.
I would have been too drawn
into my phone, and I would
have missed things.
So I want to try and have--
- Takes things and completely spins it.
Who would ever say that?
She was sad of course.
She was sad she lost pictures,
she was sad, you know
it's work to get more
stuff on a new phone,
and it's money, but she
really tries and takes every
situation, every situation--
- And finds something to be grateful for.
And I think that's a wonderful
skill to develop, and I'm
going to work on developing that skill.
I think one thing that is
hard for us, is to be grateful
for the trials that we go through.
Because, while we're going
through them, it's difficult
and it's hard, but when we
are done going through them,
and we overcome them, we can
see the lessons we've learned.
So I'm grateful for the
trials that we go through,
because of the lessons that we
will learn and have learned.
- And that's with anything, anything.
- I'm grateful that we went
to China, and were able
to experience the culture
because we never have before,
and I thought it was wonderful.
And it made me grateful
for things over in China,
and things over in here.
I'm grateful for obviously
our family and our kids,
I love them.
I'm grateful for the
opportunities that we have here,
right here, talking to you.
I'm grateful for this opportunity.
And for everyone.
And I hope we express our
gratitude enough, and I hope you
know the things we are grateful
for, and I hope we talk
about them a lot, because
we are grateful for them.
- Something that Ritchie said too,
that I'll wrap up with is,
it was cool to be in China,
to be on the other end
of the world, and they didn't un--
Some people didn't understand
us, and we didn't understand
them, but through our phones
we could talk into an app,
and it'd translate it to
them, and then they'd talk,
and it'd translate it to us.
That was so cool, 'cause
there's nothing different
about us, like, we,
and it was a wonderful
experience to do that.
And see the other person
light up and laugh when like,
we just weren't understanding
each other but we were trying
to, like, it was a different
experience and I loved it.
And I grew from it, and
I'm grateful for it.
And we met some wonderful people there.
Thank you guys so much for
watching our Thanksgiving
family special, and our boys are in bed.
- Penny is asleep.
She, oh my gosh, if anyone
is grateful for today,
I think Penny was.
- She unlimited amount of
hands on her back rubbing her.
She loved it.
- She was the best.
- Thanks guys.
- We'll see you tomorrow, bye!
I love you.
- Gotta get some rest.
- Let's go to sleep!
