(elegant jazzy music)
-  Those guys
are being really rude.
-  Oh.
(crunching leaves)
- I double dare you
- He's gonna see the camera's on.
- on our date night.
(laughing)
- Like they're cousins.
- Is that 'cause Boston has 'em?
- Yeah.
- Doggie doggie.
- The pop up track has 'em.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- I want that one.
- You want me to sit?
- I want to get a car track.
- A race car track?
- Yeah, it has tracks,
everythings and cars.
- So fun.
- That is fun.
We have been down here
in this filming area
prepping some videos for while we are gone
and it has just been so fun.
Some videos to look forward to,
we just got done telling
our first kiss story,
but not necessarily our first kiss,
like our very first kiss story.
We also did the house Q & A today,
so that was a lot of fun.
I put on different shirts
to make it seem like
they were different days,
but Ellie didn't,
so that's a little fail on our part,
to make it look like different days,
but either way, it's kinda funny,
you'll see that and you'll know.
(Ellie laughs)
-  You whistle at her?
Whistle,
whistle at her.
He was whistling a minute ago
and yelling at her.
- Well we've been booed.
Booed booed booed, but in a good way.
Our neighbors, I swear, are the kindest.
We have this at our front door.
And what that is,
I don't know if your neighborhood does it,
but my neighborhood as a kid we did it
every once in awhile.
You've been booed or ghosted
or hearted on Valentine's Day.
Essentially you get
this paper at your door
with some goodies.
Oh those cookies just
fell everywhere, shoot.
(laughing)
- Aww.
- Oh.
- Penny
or bread
and you know, just some treats
our neighbors gave to us
and what you do is once you get that,
you go to your neighbors
who haven't been booed
and give them a tasty treat, too.
So it's a fun little chain
letter that we're doing,
so I'm gonna go and grab
some things together
and we're gonna go boo our neighbors.
Some people bake, some people buy,
I'm gonna get some good
treats from the store here,
and get 'em delivered tonight.
(crunching plastic)
(crunching leaves)
(chill music)
- You got two new toothbrushes.
- I did get new toothbrushes.
- I'm tired.
-  Oh you are so tired.
You've had a long rough day, haven't you?
Yes.
- Jackson look, Daddy
got you a new toothbrush.
They're the same though.
- That's so they don't
have too many fights
over which tooth brush they want.
I tried to do a smart thing.
Anyway, so
- You're cute.
-  I'm not complaining.
- Delivering those little treats
was a lot harder than I thought.
It was crazy.
Because I had a couple people in mind.
I was like oh, these are our friends,
I would love to go boo them,
I don't know the correct terminology.
-  I'm brushing my teeth.
- Oh good, that's great hygiene.
And I went there, already been booed.
- How do you know?
- Because you put little stickers
in the window, so you're
not hit more than once.
So everyone has a turn.
- Never put stickers in the window,
that way you get as many
cookies as you can get.
- It's kinda true though.
- That's cute though.
- So I went to a few different places.
All of our friends that we
- Who did you go to?
- Well I'll tell ya,
all of our friends had 'em already.
So I was like man, okay well we've got
some pretty good friends, so
I went to all these places,
I ended up going to our excavator's house
and I dropped a thing off there.
- Awww.
- Yeah.
- Cute.
- We really like their family.
- He just lives down the street.
- Yeah.
And then, I don't know
if I should say this
because they might watch our videos.
I don't care.
The person who did this, I
just went to their house,
so Chelsea.
- Oh oh cute.
- Yeah I did theirs.
So that was fun.
It was harder than I thought,
because I had to go to way
more houses than I thought.
Would you look at that sunset?
It looks like, what was the
word you said Barney, Bonnie?
-  Barney?
-  Barney?
There was just a funny word.
- It looks gorgeous.
-  Gorgeous.
-  Gorgeous.
-  Do you know my favorite thing
about the mountains Jared?
-  What's that?
- They look like a photograph turning.
-  Aww, yeah.
-  Potatoes as a side.
-  That sounds really great.
-  That sounds really good.
-  Sounds really good.
Sounds delicious.
-  These things sound very good.
-  Those guys
are being really rude
-  Oh.
-  You guys are being really rude.
That wasn't even fun,
I just took his camera
and Jared, fix your lens.
- I have to fix it
every clip I film, okay?
So it's just a little (kissing).
- You're making us feel uncomfortable.
- Sorry, we just like to kiss in private
in public places.
- In private, in public places?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
It's a little door, it's our wall.
- Isn't this so cute, guys?
-  Yes.
-  It's called the Timber Mine.
- This is The Copper Mill.
(laughing)
It's not the Copper Mine,
it's not The Timber Mill,
it's not The Timber Mine,
it's The Copper Mill.
- I was thinking of that place,
because we just got a gift card
to give to our
builder.
- Builder.
- That's why I said it.
We're at The Copper Mill.
And it's so woodsy.
And I sat by the fireplace
and it was lovely.
- And kicks people off of the fireplace.
- Well what happened, it was so funny.
Ellie walks in and then
I walk in after her,
so I don't see what she does
or what happened beforehand.
-  And we had just
gotten talking about it.
- Yeah, talking about doing funny things
in public places
and I walk in and Ellie sits down
right next to this girl
and this girl gets up
and they say something,
and I'm like did you just kick her out
of that seat, because you
wanted to sit by the fire?
- What had really happened
is I sat down next to her
and we smiled and I said this is nice
and then she was really hot
and she got up.
-  Because it was by the fire.
- And she got up and left.
And Jared said oh did you kick her out
and she laughed and played along,
and said yeah she did,
and then it was really funny.
(laughing)
I didn't kick her out.
We became really good friends.
- Actually we did, we talked with them
for a few minutes after that.
Here's the deal okay?
You haven't talked yet to the waiter.
We all have.
So I double dare you,
that when you order,
to do it in a Russian accent.
- I don't know a Russian accent.
- Okay okay then
- That's too much work.
- Then any accent.
You have to order, any time
you talk to him directly,
you have to use a different accent.
Okay?
- Oh.
-  You do not have to.
- Different.
- I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
- You have to do it, okay?
- You do it.
Joel's really good at
stuff you tell him to do.
- Do the Wisconsin accent.
- Wisconsin?
-  Yeah.
- Oh yeah, you know this
steak looks really good,
ya know?
- Yes.
- There you go.
That's what you should do.
So I double dare you
- He's gonna see the camera's on.
- on our date night, to do an accent
when you order, okay?
- You do not have to.
- Yes he does, this is a double dare.
- So what, it's a date, so I don't want
to overwhelm them.
- It's a double dare date night.
- Okay we're good.
- It's happening.
- It's happening.
- Double dog date?
-  Double dog dare.
- Okay, just give 'em a sample.
-  Give me a little sam sam.
- Oh yeah you know these steaks,
they look really good, you know.
We caught 'em down at a
shop in Fayette, ya know?
(laughing)
- Down at the shop,
that's a good every time.
- Here he is.
Thank you.
- Are you guys ready to order?
- What kind of jelly is that?
- Jam?
- We call it jam.
Do you call it jam or jelly?
- I'm ready, so I'm gonna order.
- Oh you know, I think I'm
gonna do the filet mignon.
And the hand-breaded shrimp,
how big are those shrimp?
- About like
- Prawns.
- So a pretty good size, yeah?
Okay, I'll do that,
and then does that come
with a soup or salad?
- Oh Wisconsin, that's pretty close, yeah.
I lived in Minnesota and
it was pretty similar.
-  What?
- Yours is good enough.
(laughing)
- That's awesome, okay.
- He totally called you out on that.
- What are the odds of that?
- He's from Wisconsin.
- I know.
- He is from Wisconsin.
- What are the odds of that?
- Well he said Canadian Wisconsin
and his accent is like
(clapping)
- Like he was like, he wanted
some Cheetos and Red bull.
Or something, I can't even do it.
It was magical.
- We need to ask him to
do it, ask him to do it.
-  Yeah, yeah I will.
- I feel like that backfired.
- It really was.
- What are the odds of that?
- He said you were good.
- That thar backfired.
- It really did.
- Literally if I'd have
done a Russian accent
or whatever,
do you think he'd have been like,
well I'm from the Soviet, you know.
-  Yeah, that would not happen, no.
(laughing)
- Do it like
yeah yeah, you got it.
Do your upper lip.
-  What are you trying to do Elvis?
What are you trying to do?
- I love it when I make Bonnie wheeze.
Don't do your bottom lip just the top.
- I can't.
-  What is it?
- I'm trying it.
-  What are you doing, I can't
(laughing)
- Just quiver your upper lip.
-  Quiver?
(laughing)
- Do it.
He doesn't have much lips to begin
Jared that's good.
Now just your bottom one.
(laughing)
Just your
- Do your whole mouth.
- It's not a quiver,
-  it just moves.
(laughing)
(Jared laughing)
(laughing)
You know what Bonnie and I used to do?
When we were on the road trips,
Bonnie would make me talk
to her and read lips,
so Bonnie and I are really
good at reading lips.
'Cause we use to say
words and we had to guess
what she was saying.
-  So you practiced
a lot at reading lips
so you're good.
- We did.
- And we're really good at it.
- We're good at focusing.
- That's why did so good on
that video we just got off.
- You know what I noticed when you guys
were doing your
you guys have the same earrings on.
- We do!
-  You guys must be sisters.
- Thanks.
- We had so much fun on our date night
with Bonnie and Joel.
You know, we love to laugh.
It's so much fun.
So that brings me to the question
that I want to pass to you.
What is your favorite date night?
What is your favorite activity to do
whether it's like double date
or just with your spouse?
Let me know what's the best.
Bonus points if it's cost
effective, like cheap,
if you can do it for free.
What's your favorite date.
Let me know in the comments down below.
Today has been crazy.
We got a lot of work
done behind the scenes,
which is kinda frustrating sometimes
because I'm so actively in the office
doing things and you guys don't see that.
But, at any rate, we had a blast tonight
with Bonnie and Joel.
We laughed really hard.
It was great,
so thank you so much for watching.
We hope you have a wonderful day, night,
evening, weekend, whenever
you're watching this,
I hope you have a smile on your face.
So thank you for putting on on ours
and we'll see you guys next time.
Bye.
(laughing)
