- What the heck?
- A thousand years, move over nature,
man's getting in the way.
We're speeding things up.
- Guys, I am 18 weeks along.
This pregnancy is flying by.
One month ago for Christmas, Jackson got,
what did you get for Christmas?
_ and a rock tumbler.
And for one month we have been listening
to this rock tumbler go, go, go, go, go.
We have changed the grits,
we have saved a rock each time
we have changed the grits,
and now this little guy is so excited
that your Christmas
present is finally done.
-  You excited to see it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's open it up.
- I'm gonna close my eyes.
-  He likes surprises.
- I'm gonna hide
under the table.
-  Okay, we're
gonna go get it okay.
-  Penny, do you remember this?
You smelling it?
That was your first collar.
This was Penny's first collar
when she was just a puppy.
-  A little one?
-  Yeah.
Bring back memories?
-  Typical, Dad does the hide work,
kids sit and wait until
the prize is ready.
- Jackson, he's like I wanna be surprised.
So he wants to hide.
-  Okay, Daddy,
you do the dirty work
and then he wants to be surprised.
They're so beautiful.
-  Wow.
- What the heck?
-  Aren't those beautiful?
- Look at how shiny that is.
Look at that.
-  Look at that
little tiny little blue one.
- You know what, this looks just like...
-  Grandpa _ that
he got for his birthday.
We're gonna hang this in
their bathroom downstairs.
- No, I wanna put it out.
-  You wanna take it out?
You have all of your rocks
that you have shined up now
that you can keep now.
Look at the pink one.
- We have a picture of this.
-  Let's see, let's find it
in your rock book.
Jackson wants to find his rock.
Let's see what it looks like again.
Oh, is it the dalmatian stone on this row?
On this row, can you find it?
It's over here on this side.
Should we read up about it.
It's on page 25.
Whoa, that is so cool.
Is that your favorite one?
- I want the other rocks.
-  He is loving this.
So Jared just brought out another pack.
These are what they all looked like
when they started.
- So look,
look at that difference.
-  So Jackson, did
you have fun doing that?
I think, should we do more?
- Yeah.
- I think we're gonna do another round.
We have a whole other bag.
We're gonna throw the bags in.
- I don't think you understand.
-  Look at Penny's face.
- We took 1,000 years of nature
and we made it into one month.
1,000 years, move over nature,
man's getting in the way.
We're speeding things up.
-  We're gonna
do this another round.
We're gonna put all of
the rocks in and every
few days we're gonna take it out
and do the same thing.
So we'll see another
batch of these in a month.
- Look at the difference between this one
and the dalmatian.
Look how jagged those edges are.
- Is this one polished?
-  Not yet.
Do you wanna polish it?
That one's gonna look rad.
Okay, you put that in there.
- Something that I used to do as a kid
all of the time with my buddies
is we would take our Nerf guns
and we would shoot each other with them.
But not only that, we'd shoot each other
and we'd try to catch them.
So Ellie has her Nerf gun over there,
I'm gonna try and catch the ball.
(cheers)
You're aiming a little too high.
I was worried that it would go up again.
Try again.
- Go.
- It hit the post.
Oh there it goes.
- Alright, I'm ready.
-  Here we go.
(laughter)
That was a strike and you missed.
It's kind of fun to do that.
I think what sparked
that when we were kids
was when the Matrix came
out and they did the whole..
And we're like, oh I bet
we could catch a bullet.
So we got our Nerf guns.
Sure enough, we practiced hard enough
that we were able to do it.
So it was pretty fun.
- Guys, I am 18 weeks along.
This pregnancy is flying by.
Baby is now, he is able
to swallow, hiccup, yawn.
He's rolling and kicking around.
I just set up my 20 week ultrasound.
Hopefully they can do a 3D one.
I don't believe I've had like
a really good 3D ultrasound
yet with any of my babies.
I'm so excited to do that this week.
But I wanted to sit down and talk about
how I've been feeling and update about me
and somethings that I have got.
So I'm gonna start with some of things
that I have purchased because that's kind
of the most fun right now.
I have purchased a few things for me
and a few things for the baby.
So I showed you guys a baby blanket
that my mom had started
with her oldest baby,
but she didn't finish
until baby number five,
me, came along.
That was in my nursery.
I pulled it out and I thought
why, I'm gonna use this.
It's so cute.
It has woodland creatures on it.
So this is the baby bedding that I found
that I purchased on Etsy.
It should be coming, it's not
gonna come til like March.
That is coming.
I thought that would be really cute
with the little woodland creatures
and we'll find him a little
animal to have in his crib.
That's what I bought for him.
Then I got these from Copper Pearl.
You guys suggested that on Twitter.
I asked a few baby places
that you guys liked.
It's funny because once I got these,
I was like oh.
Jared had got a sample of a few baby items
when he went to a Studio C filming.
In that was some Copper Pearl bandanas.
I was like, oh how fun.
I got some burp rags for baby
and I thought that these
designs were really cute.
These are teepees, these are trees.
They're long, really big, really soft.
They're gonna be perfect for when
the baby spits up everywhere.
Unless he's not one to spit up,
I don't believe Calvin
was much to spit up.
I don't remember him spitting up tons.
Then some feathers.
I got those.
I also got some nipple cream.
With Jackson I used the lanolin cream
that they give you at the hospital.
With Calvin I just used coconut oil.
With this baby, I was on
Thyme Maternity, T H Y M E.
They have some clothing,
one of you guys suggested that company.
And I saw some nipple cream
and I thought, I'm gonna get some.
I've never really purchased any.
It's a beast to nurse and
day three is the worst
because you start to
crack, it gets kinda bad.
So I'm hoping by using a good nipple cream
I can prevent that.
So I got some cream on that website.
It doesn't smell, it's really thick.
So we'll see how that goes.
On that same website, I bought a really
pretty maternity blouse.
This is really, really
stretchy, really long
and it fits so pretty.
Jared and I, I think we're
gonna be able to go to
this baby tech conference where they have
tons of new baby gear and
I wanna look really cute
for the event and feel really spruced up.
So I got this shirt from there.
Sunday's are kind of miserable for me
because my tights are too tight.
If I don't wear tights, we're in winter,
and I just wanna be warm
and I like wearing nylons,
nylons or tights.
So I finally, finally bought
some maternity nylons.
These are from A Pea in a Pod Maternity
and they will go up above my belly.
So hopefully I'll be much more comfortable
on Sunday's at church.
Then I also got a dress.
This is just a really simple dress.
This is from A Pea in a
Pod and then right here
it has a cute little detail at the bottom.
Those are some of the
things that I have bought
for me and the baby.
As far as foods and cravings
and what I have been eating,
I have been loving salads.
And I'm not a salad person.
I definitely don't make
a lot of salads at home.
I love Costa Vita salads,
_ salads, Zupa salads.
If I go out to eat, that's typically what
I've been getting.
They just tasted really good.
Last night I made a salad.
It's really not the healthiest dressing,
but it's flipping good.
It's like a mimic of
Texas Roadhouse dressing.
It's like a cup of mayo,
a cup of buttermilk,
and a little bit of
the Hidden Valley seasoning to
make your own salad dressing.
You mix that together.
I just had that with a
bunch of green lettuce
and carrots and a boiled
egg and tomatoes on it.
It was so good.
I've been loving salads.
Other than that, I don't
think I've been like
have one certain food that I've
been loving, loving lately.
I still have not been a huge
fan of sweets and treats.
With all of my pregnancies,
all of these being boys,
I have never been one to
really want tons of sweets.
I've been really liking hearty foods.
Like the other day I got
a bunch of coconut yogurt,
cut up banana, some raspberries
and strawberries in that.
That tasted so good to me.
That to me was like a sweet treat
but it wasn't like candy.
I really liked that.
How my body has been feeling,
I can't believe that I'm 18 weeks along.
I'm almost halfway.
My belly isn't huge, but it's there.
But I've really felt
like I physically ache.
My back has been hurting
really, really bad.
The my stomach right here,
all my babies sit low,
my stomach just hurts so
bad and it's so tight.
I've been going to the chiropractor
for the last few weeks.
Going to the chiropractor
really has saved my sanity
in a sense.
I've really enjoyed going
to see my chiropractor.
I only go, like a five minute appointment.
She does everything she needs to do,
we sit and talk for a
minute, it's kinda refreshing
just to talk to a friend
and then I'm done.
Then I see her in another week.
I can tell when I need to go back
because like two days
before my appointment,
my body will really start to ache,
my neck will start to get really tight,
and I'll have a lot of tension.
I'll just know that I need
to go see the chiropractor.
That's something that I
have really done for myself
that I'm really glad that I have done.
I have always wanted to do
lots of maternity massages
during a pregnancy.
That would be like a dream.
But really, this is what's helped me.
I physically feel really good.
I think soon I would love to
go get a pregnancy massage.
But I really love that
Jared will rub my feet,
he'll rub my back and that
makes me feel so good at night.
Jared will rub my back at night
and it just is something that
he's always willing to do
but especially me being pregnant.
It's been really nice.
I want you to sit down
and just talk with us
and with you guys.
- Glad to be here on our vlog.
- I know, on our vlog.
Just how it's been our last few weeks.
I went to film a pregnancy
update like two weeks ago
and after I'd started for a minute,
I just, I think Jared was like,
oh my gosh, what's wrong.
I threw the camera down,
I'm like whatever, I'm not doing this.
I was just mad.
I have learned that us
filming for four years,
if I'm gonna film something,
especially if there's
a lot of emotion to it,
I can't share how I feel unless I
feel okay about sharing it.
I wasn't feeling very well mentally.
It's taken me about two
and half, three weeks
to get out of my funk.
It's taken a long time.
I don't even know what's caused it.
I told Jared that the first
week that it was happening,
I told him, I'm like I feel
like I have post partum
depression right now.
My body, my mind.
I just felt like I felt
like after I had Calvin.
I was like, I don't feel myself at all.
- Yeah.
We've noticed that.
But it's not the worst thing in the world.
I think it goes to show that
there's some factors
that go along with this.
We're in the middle of wintertime.
There is something true
about being outside
where it's warm that
just lifts your spirits.
That is definitely true.
We're having a hard time
potty training Calvin.
- And just life.
- We have our ups and downs with it.
Some days are good, some days are bad.
And that's another thing.
Just the fact that you're pregnant
and going through all of
these changes physically,
hormonally, emotionally.
All of that plays into that.
And putting your life
out there is a big thing.
I feel like that has had a big factor
in how you are taking
each day as it comes.
- Yeah.
- I've seen the low and the lows
and I've see the high and the highs
and I see them come in
waves and everything.
But you always come out of it,
which is a great things.
Like today's been really good
and some other days have been like okay,
let's see what we can
do to make Mom happy.
I have those days too
and I'm not pregnant.
I have those days when
I'm like okay Ellie,
I need you to help me out.
I need you to get that
shovel because I'm down deep
and you need to dig me out.
- Yeah.
I think it's been good that
I've been potty training
too Calvin because it's forced me to like
just be in a bubble like in the house.
There's pros and cons
to that like you said.
- Cabin fever.
- Cabin fever.
It's been good for me
because I've just like
distanced myself with like the camera.
I've been able to just
sit and film my emotions.
I've thought a lot about my miscarriages
and those were really
just a few months ago.
I've been pregnant a lot
which is crazy to even say.
I'm still sad about that.
Those emotions come back still.
I think that the last
few weeks I've just been
feeling a lot of that.
I've definitely learned
that after I had Calvin,
if I just tell myself buck up and be good,
I can do that and that'll
fix it for a minute,
but it'll come back 10 times worse.
So it's felt good to me to just
sit and feel those emotions
and then to really come out of that.
I feel really good the last few days.
I feel like I'm coming out of that.
So I'm starting to feel better
and now I'm more willing to
sit and just talk about it.
- Absolutely.
You should always feel through the
length of the emotion.
You should never try and
bottle those emotions up.
You let those emotions play out.
Whether you're sad, let
yourself be sad for awhile.
Let yourself be mad for a little while.
Then process that.
Then become happy or whatever.
Allow yourself to process those emotions.
- Anything else we wanna talk about?
Baby names I think.
- Let's see.
- People wanna know baby names.
- I think we're still right where we are.
- Nothing new there.
Can I tell them a few
baby names that I like?
- I'll allow it.
- You'll allow it.
- I'll allow it.
- Mason is still one that we really like.
I love that Jackson loves that name.
- Yes, as far as Jackson's concerned,
that's the baby's name.
- The baby's Mason.
We haven't talked about it
a lot in the house anymore,
because at first we were really excited
and I really thought that
was gonna be his name.
Then after a minute, I was like,
I'm just gonna not talk about it too much.
I don't want it to get stuck
and us think that we
have to name him Mason.
So we've really been just brainstorming.
I love the name Mason.
I really like the name Dean.
And Jared still really
loves the name Dallon.
- Right.
- I love the name Dallon,
but I worry that it's
a little close to Calvin.
It doesn't matter at the end of the night.
- That's the thing is,
these things like that
it doesn't matter whether
they're too close,
whether they're a cousin's name,
whether they're an old friend's name.
Those things don't matter
because they become
their own person.
But when you're thinking about it,
it's like okay, will
that play a role in how
we say their names or anything like that.
It's just something in
the back of your mind.
I think we've been really
trying hard to come up
with names that like, Jackson, Calvin.
I think we've been trying
to find names that fit that
framework.
- Fit it well.
So we're still thinking of baby names.
My ultrasound's coming up,
that's gonna be a huge day for us
to see the baby and see...
- Everything.
- Really details.
- I didn't get to go
to your last ultrasound
so I'm like I hope...
- And I hardly was able to
see him, it was kinda funny.
- That is our vlog for the day.
That is our 18 weeks pregnancy update.
- Baby update.
- Can you believe that,
we're 18 weeks pregnant?
- I can't believe it.
That's the babysitter.
- All in all, things are going well.
Of course we have ups,
of course we have downs.
That's part of life.
But the important thing
is that when you're going
through the down, that you
realize that it's not the end.
Then you find your way up out of it.
Because no matter what,
there's light at the end of the tunnel.
The day is always darkest before the dawn.
No matter what Ellie, no matter
how hard you day has been,
I will be here for you.
- Well thanks.
It's been nice to just like vent
and complain or
just vent.
- Because it's important
to feel those emotions.
- Right Calvin?
- Right Calvin?
- I love being married
and one of the things
with being married is
you support each other.
It's been really nice for Jared
to be able to support me right now.
I appreciate that.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Hopefully we can go like to
a movie tonight or something.
I'm trying to get a
babysitter so we'll see.
We'll see you guys later.
- Bye.
