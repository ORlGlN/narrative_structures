- The uncertainty of when
is what's hard, I think,
I don't quite know how
to mentally grasp that.
I could not sleep last night,
I was having nightmares all night,
I was rolling back and forth all night.
I woke up this morning
with a very light cramping.
Watch yesterday's video
if you wanna be caught up.
I just woke up really sad
and I don't want to do this again
and I can feel that
things might be starting
and I'm just very blue and very sad.
I stayed up last night,
I grabbed a few books
because I'm just so sick,
I don't wanna watch TV,
I don't wanna do anything,
and I'm not really one to read a ton,
I really love to listen to books,
especially when we're on the road.
But I did pick up a few books last night
and I'm excited to read them
but we gotta get the kids to school.
I just dropped Jackson off at school
and I have a few
pregnancy apps on my phone
because I was seeing
which one I liked the best
and I had What To Expect, I had Nurture,
I had Baby Center and then The Bump.
And The Bump was by far my favorite.
I loved going to it everyday
saying how big the baby was,
saying how far along I was.
It had like a 3D version of
like what the baby looked like,
I just got a notification
and email from them.
So it's just like little
things, it's like I have to just
step back and like step back into reality
and get rid of them and stop
notifications on my email
and it's just crazy.
Thank you Bonnie, you are so good to us.
- I love you!
- Thanks for letting me be a flip-flopper.
She's like "I'll come over and
sit and hang out with you!"
I was like "That sounds great!"
She was like "I'll bring you lunch."
I'm like "No I'm not
hungry, not in the mood."
Then she got here I was like "I'm hungry!
"And Pamela's hungry"
So we all got to eat.
I keep telling her I called my zit Pamela.
- You call her Pamela? I
thought it was little Jared.
-  So we're hungry,
we're gonna eat, thank you.
- Have you ever broken into something
you're not supposed to be in,
or maybe have you ever
broken into something
you're supposed to be in
but can't get inside of?
That is the predicament I'm in.
I'm not breaking into something
I'm not supposed to be in,
I need something out
of a safe that I have,
it's very important but I can't get in it.
I can't find the key and
the biometric sensor battery
is dead. We've got a couple
of things that we can try.
Joel has a very similar one
and we're gonna see if his key works.
If not, we may have to
break into this bad boy.
Yes, I'm talking 'bout you,
grrr shake my fist at you!
So Joel if this key works
I think that says something
about the security of these things.
-  Yeah.
No go.
- Okay, shoot. Alright
do you have a bobby pin?
And maybe like a flathead screwdriver?
- Oh, yeah, let me grab
my lock-picking kit
- Are lock-picking kits illegal?
-  I'm assuming so
- If they are then I
definitely don't have one.
-  I don't have one.
- I definitely don't if they're illegal.
If they're illegal, I don't know,
I can't answer that question
because it might be illegal.
One of Ellie's friends from
church is an incredible artist
and she did this amazing painting for us
and we got it framed and
we just got a phone call
that it's all done and so
I'm here to pick it up.
And I know this is gonna
lift Ellie's spirits,
I know Ellie's doing so amazing as it is
but I know this will be
a really, really great
pick-me-up for her too.
So here it is, actually it's upside down
so there it is. It is way
bigger than I thought.
It is way big.
I thought it'd be able to
fit in the van top to bottom
but it's actually too
tall and we can't fit it
in between the seats so
I'm gonna have to come back
with all of the car
seats out and everything
so I can fit it in there.
And maybe even need a
truck 'cause it's big guys.
-  Hey!
(Ellie screams)
Did I scare you?
- I did not like that
-  Calvin, where
are you taking my wife?
- I did not like that!
-  Did I scare you good?
- You did.
- I'm sorry. Calvin is
driving you on a little date.
- Yeah, okay let's go. I kept
telling him let's get on the--
- Okay go, get on the sidewalk.
Oh my gosh, of course. How cute is that?
Look at him take you, that's so cute.
He's pushing it and everything.
Okay here's the update.
So try as I might, I could
not get the safe open
using alternative methods,
much to my dismay.
And, according to the internet,
those are pretty easy to get into
but I think my model is
just a little bit different
to where it actually does matter.
They may have fixed a
bunch of things, you know,
that they were trying to
prevent in the first place.
We took the car seats out of the van,
I've got my dad here to
help me get that painting.
So, first stop painting,
second stop locksmith.
I have to submit defeat.
What the heck? These darn
kids taking my parking spot
left and right. What am I
gonna do with these guys? Jeez.
Alright I've got a bone to pick with you.
I've got a bone to pick with you.
Were you driving the four-wheeler last?
Or was it Calvin?
- Me and Calvin and Mommy.
- You all did it? You
are in my parking spot.
You did that on purpose!
- Hi! I know you're excited to see me
but I'm upset with you!
- Why?
- He parked in my parking spot!
- Did you hear him say "Dad's home!"
-  "Dad's home",
can you say "Dad's home"?
-  He just does it when he wants.
-  I know.
- Pretzels!
-  Pretzels!
Hey so I've got a couple of things
that you probably want to see.
- When we moved into the
house my neighbor, me and her
have become friends, and I
didn't realize how beautiful
she does these paintings.
She has this huge paint shop
that she does in her home.
For a long time I thought
that it would be really nice
to add a little more color in here
and to find something huge right there
but if you ever find a huge, huge painting
it is crazy amounts of money.
I just wanted to sit on it and
wait until I found something
and her work is beautiful,
so I had her paint me
a huge painting for this wall.
Coincidence or not, it
happened to be done today
and it put a smile on my face,
so I'm excited to see it come in.
The boys and I played
outside, everyone's bathed
and ready for bed.
- Pretzels!
And today has been overwhelmingly good,
everyone has been just
very sweet and tender to me
and I feel like I'm in such
a weird spot right now.
I'll tell you in a
minute, they're coming in.
Let's see it! It's huge.
It's 50 x 80.
It's huge! That's insane!
That's insane! Ah she painted that!
It took her I don't know
how long, a few weeks.
- Can I tell you a
secret? It's upside down.
-  It's beautiful.
- Okay it was ugly before but
now that we've flipped it over
it's much more beautiful, don't you think?
I think the accents are just
in all the right places.
-  It's beautiful.
- It really, really is.
And so what we're gonna do, Dad,
if you wouldn't mind following me,
we're just gonna put it,
you can just lift it up.
-  It'll go up
on that wall back there.
It's gonna be beautiful.
- Isn't that so cool?
-  Awwww I love
her. Thanks Chelsea!
Well that painting was beautiful
but I think what's hard
is it's like, okay, I
have about two weeks,
a week and a half of
you're going to miscarry,
you just don't know when.
And I think that's the hard part, is like,
I don't wanna go through this,
I don't wanna be like
crampy and laying in bed
and bleeding tons and
having to sit on the toilet
and achy and crying and
emotional and sad like,
I don't wanna have to do
that, but I do, I have to.
I think that's what's hard about today,
is like this morning I was pretty crampy
but then the rest of
the day I've been fine.
And so, yeah, not much more,
I even know how to say or how to express
just the unknown, the uncertainty
of when is what's hard, I think.
I don't know how to quite
mentally grasp that.
But I have enjoyed being
just with the kids,
just doing whatever they want, you know?
- I wanna play the popper!
- Yeah, that's what we've done,
we've gone from one toy to another today.
-  Okay, ready? I'm
going to put 'em right here
And can you put 'em
right here on the popper?
Like, I'll lock 'em and
you can put 'em right there
- See!
-  Okay, perfect. You
lock 'em. Put 'em right there.
This is scary it's gonna pop soon!
Put it on there. Wow! It popped!
- It popped!
- It did. Okay ready, set, go!
Make sure they're locked.
That one popped!
Okay, that's not quite how it works
but they think it's fun.
Okay, you know what?
I think that this would
be fun for the boys
and I think it'd be fun for me to see.
Hey, Calvin, look at Mama.
Do you guys want to pick
some of mommy's flowers?
- Yeah!
- Okay, when I got the books yesterday,
they had the cutest store in town called
Freckle Farm where I've
got a lot of my plants,
and they had this and I
thought that was so beautiful.
So I'm gonna let them
pick some of my flowers
after they're done making out with this.
Okay let's go!
- Those are so cute. They won't live long
but it's something fun and I think
that this little bowl is so cute.
Especially if I were to buy
fresh flowers at the store,
it would be perfect 'cause
they would be in there more.
But so sweet! Love them! Love you!
Given the circumstances,
today has actually been
a pretty great day. We've
been together as a family
and just spending time together
has been very, very nice.
And I just wanna say I'm proud of Ellie.
She didn't have to do anything today.
No one expected her to do anything.
She could have laid in bed all day
and that would have been
perfectly fine and normal.
But she didn't do that. She got up,
she got ready for the day,
she did things with us,
she did things with the kids, she smiled.
We definitely had our moments
where we were sad too,
but, like I said, all in
all, it's been a good day
with family and I'm just, I'm
proud of Ellie for everything.
I love you, Ellie. You
mean the world to me.
And I'm so grateful that
I have you in my life.
And not only that,
I just feel so overcome
with gratitude for you guys.
You guys have been so wonderful.
All of the support that
you have been sending us
has just been overwhelming.
It's been so wonderful,
so thank you, guys.
That is where we're
gonna end the vlog today.
We appreciate you and
we're grateful for you.
I love my family, and we will
see you guys tomorrow. Bye.
