(bright music)
- Fresh laundry, clean
bathroom, fresh sheets,
it feels so good.
The house is clean.
It's three o'clock.
I cleaned every bathroom, feels so good.
Jared's flight got delayed,
which kinda stinks, but it
gave me a few extra hours
to spruce up, go around
the house and clean
and it feels really good.
So I'm gonna take a
bath, it's three o'clock.
The kids have been, guys,
the Hot Wheel track that Jackson got
for his birthday, no lie, hours.
Him and Calvin have been
hours playing with that.
I'll play with them for
awhile, I'll do stuff,
they'll still play.
It has been such a fun toy,
I'm so glad we got it.
But I also made an appointment
with the dermatologist
for Jared and I next week.
So I've had, and a lot of people think,
I've been tweeting about it
and a lot of people are like
oh it's pregnancy-related,
which I totally agree, it probably is,
but this was a freckle yesterday.
It was a freckle.
And today, it is a mole.
It's raised, or last night I noticed,
so yesterday I noticed that it was raised.
So in a matter of a day and a half,
it went from a flat freckle
to a raised mole.
And the last few weeks,
Jared and I have been talking
that we want to go, just get head to toe
checked out, all of our bumps.
I have a few other mole spots
that I have some really
weird history behind it
that I want to have a doctor check out.
And Jared has this crazy bump on his back
that we got checked out years ago
and a doctor's like oh it's fine,
but it's getting bigger,
so we just need to go get checked out
from head to toe.
So I feel good about everything
that we've done today,
just getting appointments done,
getting things checked off,
I'm gonna sit in the bathtub,
and get ready for the day.
(laughs)
- Good morning, it's another day at CES
and it's another freakin'
exciting adventure.
Look what's behind me.
-  Let's talk about this one first.
- We're back with Mercedes
and we're talking about
another self-driving car,
no big deal.
(upbeat music)
Alright here we go.
Oh man.
This car is just nice on its own.
It's so nice in here.
Hey Zack, will you point at Dan
on that computer for me?
- Who's this?
- Can you walk again?
- Yeah look, there he's moving.
There he's moving.
See he's right up there walking across.
-  And look, there's
little yellow lines and stuff.
I think you can even tell
what camera he's holding.
-  Yeah, there's three buttons, yep.
-  Oh my gosh that's so cool.
So you see all those things moving?
-  It's like a video game.
-  Yeah, like a video game.
You're seeing everything just going crazy.
Those are all those cars
passing through us right now.
We were just at an intersection earlier
seeing all this cross-traffic going,
all this turning
and the screen was just lighting up
like the Fourth of July.
It was so cool to see
every single data point,
every single potential danger
and everything, what the driver's doing,
where the car is, where the lanes are.
All the cars swimming
across the turn lane,
that's so cool.
I'm having a great time here at CES.
I'm about to go speak again
at the DJI booth.
It was really great yesterday
and I know it's gonna be great today.
I just am really grateful
for the opportunities
that YouTube has allowed
us to have and to do
and thanks for being along here with us.
It means a lot to me that you guys
are here watching and
we're grateful for ya.
And I want to let you know that.
Everyone seems to be looking at something.
(atmospheric music)
I'm too short, I have to use it to see
what's going on.
(laughing)
- What is this?
Is this just a big LED?
- This is The Wall.
It's like 150 inch--
So I am backstage at
the DJI booth right now,
getting ready for my presentation.
But I just wanted to show you.
You saw on the other side
where they had my screen with my picture?
This is behind all of that.
This is what was making
that picture possible.
That is insane.
It's so cool to see everything
behind the scenes here.
Last year I was at CES,
I kept getting tweets from Angela
and Angela was like Jared
I've got this collar
for Penny to give to you, let's meet up.
And it just never worked.
-  Yeah.
- But we finally made it work.
I'm here with Angela.
- Hi.
- She's part of the
international pet group.
And they have these collars that light up
and does the leash light up too?
- Yeah, they both light up.
- So when you go on a walks in the dark,
you know where your dog is,
in case they're going anywhere,
so thank you so much,
it's so nice to finally meet you.
Angela has actually watched out videos
for four years now.
- Yeah.
- So thank you so much
- for being a part of our family.
- No problem, yeah.
- It's cool to meet our YouTube family
here at CES.
- Yeah it's fun.
I'm glad you're here.
- I'm glad I'm here
too and we get to meet.
Thank you.
Well it is officially time
to say goodbye to Las Vegas.
It's been a lot of fun
hanging out and seeing,
and meeting so many new
people and even companies.
That's the coolest part of CES
is you essentially get a small look
into the future of this year
from all sorts of companies, old and new.
But I think my favorite
part is being there
with some of my buddies,
Dan, Zack and meeting some
new friends along the way.
I am so excited to get home to my family.
I have a couple goodies for the boys
and I'm hoping that they're still awake
by the time I get home.
The unfortunate news of the day
is that my flight was delayed three hours.
So kinda good, kinda bad.
It gave me some extra time
to edit Jackson's birthday video
and I was able to change a few things
and make it more exciting,
more Ellie and Jared
vlog-like, birthday-like.
Those days are very special to us
and those are the days that we want
to look back on the most.
And those flashbacks, they get me right
in the heartstrings and they pull at them
and I cry and it's amazing and I love it.
CES is not everyone's favorite thing,
especially with some of our viewers here.
But I want to do things
that I'm passionate about,
something I strive for.
And I know not a lot of people voted
on the tech and reviews thing,
but I feel like if I
don't do something that--
-  May I have
your attention please.
If you're the person taking the long--
- - And if I do things that
I'm more passionate about,
whether that be music,
tech, sports, anything,
I think you'll see a
little bit more of that.
Because when you do the things
that you're passionate about,
you get fulfillment and
I want to be fulfilled
and I want you to see that fulfillment
coming through in what we do everyday.
But for now, I'm excited
to get home to the kids.
So let's board an airplane
in an hour and a half.
(groans)
(bright atmospheric music)
(beeping)
-  There you go.
- Thank you.
Free up freed, not too bad.
-  This is seven.
-  Oh I'm in seven?
Oh I'm sorry.
-  It's all good.
-  It's been a long day guys.
-  Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of Delta and our
Sky Team partners worldwide,
welcome aboard your Delta Connection.
This is our service to Salt
Lake City International.
(bright atmospheric music)
(rolling marbles)
-  The kids love
to sit here and play
with their marbles before bedtime.
- Hey, that is the wrong marble.
-  It's too big?
- Uh-huh.
(Calvin vocalizing)
-  Okay, go to sleep,
go to sleep, go to sleep.
Jackson's coming, hide hide.
- Ready.
- Okay, be quiet.
-  Be quiet, be quiet.
Is Calvin with you?
- Yep.
(Ellie laughs)
Get on your side.
(laughing)
-  Alright, everyone sitting?
- Uh-huh.
-  You ready?
- Uh-huh.
- I'm gonna read two books tonight.
We are reading George Catches a Cold,
which I am so glad nobody,
I mean it's January, watch,
tomorrow's vlog I'll
be like, I have a cold.
We have not had colds.
We have all felt really well.
The other day was really funny with Calvin
when he woke up and was
pale and not feeling well.
He seemed fine the rest of the day
and all day today, he
has seemed really fine.
And we are gonna be reading,
What Does it Mean to Be Present?
So that is what we are reading tonight.
- I want to do this one and this one.
-  Okay.
- This one first.
- Okay.
Well I'm pretty sure
In-N-Out will be way gross
by the time you get here.
(bell dings)
No I'm good.
I don't need anything, thanks.
Jared's like I just got off the flight
and I'm stopping at In-N-Out.
And I'm like blaaaaaa,
I want In-N-Out.
We used to go there all the time,
when we were in college.
We loved it.
I don't need any food, I've already eaten,
but I'm a little jealous
that's he's at In-N-Out.
I can't wait for Jared to get home.
I want to ask him,
we haven't even really
been able to talk much.
When he was at, was it CES?
A few years ago, when there
was this cool new breast pump
that came out, there was cool bassinetes
that had come out, like baby electronics,
so I'm excited to see if he saw anything,
because we don't need hardly anything,
some pacifiers, some clothes for sure,
for the baby, but we a crib,
we have a Pack n' Play, we have toys.
We pretty much have what we need,
but the one thing I would like to get
is a bassinet.
Because I don't know why I
never bought one with Calvin,
and Jackson, just having
them on the side of your bed,
even if it's just for a
month, it still is so nice,
rather than a big old Pack n' Play.
Easier to bend and grab the baby.
So that's probably
something that I will buy,
but I wonder if they have
come out with any cool stuff.
Jared just pulled up and I can't wait.
I'm just gonna stand here creepily,
because he got me that little bump gift
and it has a massager in it.
You know, I've been waiting a few days
for him to come home and rub my back.
(laughs)
I'm just gonna stay just like this,
until he walks in the door.
(laughs)
- Hello.
(Jared laughs)
Are you holding that
so I'll rub your back?
- I've been waiting.
- Okay, let me--
-  Why did you order me a gift
and then not be home for two days?
(Jared laughs)
- Is that from the Bump Box?
-  Yes.
- Okay, turn around.
(Ellie laughs)
- Hi.
- Hi.
-  You stink.
-  I do?
- You do.
Just like traveling.
- I stink.
- Just like traveling.
-  I missed you
-  I missed you.
- Your belly Ellie.
Oh my goodness, look at it.
- It grew since you weren't at home.
-  It did, it really did.
- Overnight.
- Especially the Instagram you posted.
It was just so cute.
- Yeah?
- Thanks.
- I am just so happy to be home.
Like it just feels good to be home
-  I'm so glad you're home.
- and not surrounded by one million people
and bumping shoulders all the time.
It's kinda fun, but I'm glad I'm home.
Okay let's be honest, I'm kind of a nerd,
the first thing that
we did when I got home
is I showed Ellie the Model 3 footage
- I liked it.
- on the camera.
- I'm excited, it was so fun.
- I'm not gonna lie,
when Jared has talked
about Teslas in the past,
I've tried to be like, that's really cool,
but it's not been my thing,
but they are sweet.
-  Yeah.
- When Dan let me get in it, they're cool.
I'm glad you got to do it.
- It's kind of like a dream,
but we'll see how things go.
Ellie and I are going to watch a movie
or watch a show, because
it's been three days
since we've seen each other,
and that's what we do every
night when we're together,
so why change now?
- That is so true.
- Right?
- Yeah, so let's say
goodnight to our friends.
- (whispering) Goodnight guys.
- Goodnight.
- Have a wonderful day
and we will see you
guys tomorrow, Saturday.
Thanks for watching, bye.
