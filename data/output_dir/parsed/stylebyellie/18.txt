- Then I am going to kick
Jared's butt here in a minute.
- How can there be so many calories in
a Krispy Kreme Donut, when it's like air?
- I was this close to
passing out this morning.
(laughing)
- We are not perfect, we are normal,
we are a fun, functional,
and dysfunctional family.
I am sick.
Jackson.
- I just may have yelled at everybody.
(laughing)
- It is one of those mornings,
a morning where we all have to get ready
out of the house at a certain time.
And not everyone is
agreeing with that now.
You've got a smile on your face now.
Are you looking at yourself?
Yay Jackson.
- Calvin look at mom.
He's so mad that I did his hair.
-  Your hair looks so good.
- No, I want it off.
-  Ok, we'll take it off.
-  Oh there we go, okay it's off.
It's better now; you good?
(laughing)
We're all getting ready
to go because we are going
to the doctor to hear our
sweet little baby's heartbeat.
We should probably pick a name.
Oooh, that looks good, whatcha makin'?
- Soup.
-  Soup?
- I mean spaghetti.
-  Oh spaghetti,
yum, that sounds delicious.
Do you have enough for everyone?
- I do.
-  Good.
- There's one, two,
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
-  Oh perfect,
just the right amount.
Is it all done?
- Yup.
-  Alright, there's my bowl.
Oh, good.
That looks delicious, is it good?
- Yeah.
- Can I have some in my bowl?
Thank you.
(slurping)
That is good.
That is so tasty.
Are you finding the right pathway?
-  Yeah.
-  Good, you're almost there.
Yay, you did it.
-  Oh.
-  Oh, you gotta get
it through that one now.
That one's kinda tough, huh?
-  It's stuck.
-  Yeah, it's stuck.
Where's the baby?
- In there.
-  There's the baby.
(kissing)
- Come here, Cal.
-  You're our baby right now, huh?
- Was mommy mad today?
- Yup.
- I won't be mad no more, okay.
-  Were you mad today, Calvin?
- We were a little mad?
- No.
-  Uh, yeah.
- Here to help the baby?
- Yup.
-  What's that one?
- They're checking it to
make sure everything is good.
-  Do you want
to sit up there Jackson?
- I've got the fuzziest belly.
-  That happens.
- I was like, oh!
-  Really, I can't even see it.
- Peach fuzz.
-  Sorry, I know that's cold.
Sometimes it takes just a minute.
(ultrasound whooshing)
To find where they're tucked.
(baby's heart beating)
Do you hear it?
So cool isn't it?
- That's his heartbeat, Jax.
-  That's what your
heart sounds like too.
- Can you hear him?
-  Oh, did that feel cold?
Do you want to wipe
your finger on a tissue?
Or did you just do it on your mom's tummy?
- He's like, I wiped it on her pants.
- That's great.
- Yeah!
-  Is that the baby's heartbeat?
- Do you hear that?
- Yep.
- Good, what did it sound like?
- A baby!
- A baby, can you make that sound?
- Wooshoo.
- Can you do that Jackson?
Go shoo, shoo, shoo.
- Shoo, shoo, shoo
-  Yeah
Jackson, you were such a good helper.
- That made me so happy
that he wanted to sit by me.
-  I know
- He was like not going to get down.
I was like, you can sit by me!
-  It was so sweet.
- We've been talking about
him all day today, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Hey what do you
want to name the baby?
- Mason Cody.
-  Mason Cody.
- Mason Cody.
-  You just like
the name Cody, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- So, our morning was a little cray cray.
- What's a cray cray?
- It's just a little crazy.
We've had a crazy morning,
but it was so fun.
(baby jabbering)
Did you meet a friend here?
What was his name, you met a friend.
- Lincoln.
- Lincoln.
And it's just fun when
you meet other couples
that you mesh with.
Like we were just in the waiting area,
and we were talking
with Lincoln's parents,
and you were playing with him,
and we're going to have a play date.
We're gonna all do dinner together.
We exchanged numbers, and
were like friends now.
It's just funny how days, you know,
it can be overwhelming one minute
and then the next
- The next minute
just change.
- It's good, you know?
-  You having a hard time?
- Okay, I've never done
maternity photo, ever.
-  Never.
- I mean, we've taken a bajillion.
- We've taken a lot of photos,
but you've never had a
maternity photo shoot.
- Maternity session, and
I really want to do that.
-  Right.
- I found a place, I'll show you.
Thanks to my friend for
telling me about it.
This is in Utah.
-  Yeah.
- So I want to do a maternity shoot here.
But I'm trying to find
a really pretty dress.
But a lot of what I find
is dresses like this.
-  Right.
- Or like this,
and they're not quite
what I'm looking for.
But I also think it would be
really pretty to show my belly.
Like this is kind of fun
for maternity shoots.
'Cause you can see your belly.
- 'Cause you can see your actual belly,
and you've never done one
where you show your belly.
- Yeah, so I don't know what to do.
- Well, I know what you could do.
Just like your shirt that
you're wearing right now,
just do that, and just
cut a hole right there,
and that way your belly can show.
And you don't have to
get a new, yeah, perfect!
And then just like have
your belly pop out.
I said ball, have your bally pop out.
- Oh that's hilarious.
-  Your bally belly.
- This is cute though too.
Just like a really pretty.
-  Yeah.
- But I just want my arms.
But I would buy this if
it had arms and stuff.
-  Yeah.
- I mean I still might, like
this would be beautiful.
-  Oh, yeah, sure, great.
- I don't know, I'm thinking.
-  Think about it.
I'm gonna just back away
from this conversation.
- Okay.
- I love you.
-  Love you!
-  Bye.
(laughter)
- You see his face?
-  You winking?
Is he winking at you?
- I looked up and he was like.
And I was like, so I just winked at him.
And he was like.
His wink.
(laughing)
You are so cute.
-  What are you guys making?
- Um, we're eating
crepes again for dinner.
-  Yay!
- So, sorry!
-  That sounds crepe!
- That's about as much as I can make.
- Thank you very much, appreciate it.
It's donut time with Jared and Joel.
(laughing)
Do you know how much I
love hearing that, Jared?
- My brother just older than me is Jared,
so it was always Jared and Joel.
The two young ones.
- Since you're technically older than me,
should we call it Joel and Jared?
-  No, I won't
have it any other way.
♪ Donut time with Jared and Joel. ♪
-  My favorite time of the day.
- So Joel and I are going to Auto Zone.
Probably soon, because Ellie
and I are actually gonna
go on a trip here pretty soon,
and we're gonna take the trailer with us.
And we're going to install
a trailer break controller.
I am anyway.
I don't think, I don't know
that our venture is gonna
be today or not, but the
purchase is going to be today.
The instillation may be another time.
But first, we gotta bust
out at least one donut.
You know, I'm not feeling the greatest,
and I think the donuts
would probably help that.
If we can open the box.
- Who do they think I am?
Oh it's open from the
end, not from the side.
I'm really confused here.
-  How do you open the box?
- I see, I see.
I was thinking it was a small
version of their big ones.
But it's an end open, not a side open.
- That's so weird.
Consistency is key, Krispy Kreme.
- Okay, regular now 'cause
it's going to be warm?
Ooh, it's warm, it's very warm.
- Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
What I don't understand, how
can there be so many calories
in a Krispy Kreme donut
when it's like air?
- All I know is all the calories
disappear once it's gone.
- No one knows where they disappear to.
- The faster we get these eaten,
the quicker they're away from us.
- I'm the worst eater in the world.
It's all over.
- Well, that was amazing.
- Still is!
- We may have to stop on the way back.
- We might have to.
Well I hope you enjoyed
the very first installment
of Donut Time with Jared and Joel.
Stay tuned for next week
where we do it again.
- We'll consume more donuts.
- Its kinda the point of the segment.
- Yeah it's really clear.
- Yep.
So we're looking at trailer breaks,
and there's so many different
things you can get with it.
Different adapters for different cars.
We have a Honda, and it's not there.
But this is the one I
was really looking at.
My father-in-law was saying
you should get this exact one.
And it's gone.
Did you take it?
Did you take it?
- Stop.
Get it, brakes.
- No, I didn't get it.
I'm just kidding; that's
not the one I wanted.
But I noticed it was
gone so its like uhhh.
Someone took that.
Okay, let's see here.
(speaks gibberish)
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Okay, the trailer mount is
mounted under the, oh, thanks.
(laughs) I am so silly.
Oh this is French.
Oh my gosh!
There we go.
Power knob, manual slide knob.
Digital power display.
I think I might be
getting in over my head.
You think that just because
I hung out with Joel,
you can come over to my house
when the kids are asleep,
and hang out with my wife.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, you think?
- I wish we were hanging out.
- Round two of work!
Ellie and Bonnie are
getting together to film
a video all about Bali.
And what's the video today?
- We're going to talk about
how we designed the dress.
- Wait, what are we talking about?
- We're going to talk about
how we designed the dress.
- Oh.
-  How you designed the dress, fun!
- And then next week is hair curls.
- Oh perfect.
I guess I gotta set everything up for ya,
so I'll see ya in two seconds.
- I have not been feeling the
best pregnancy-wise today,
and Bonnie just dropped a
big ol' fat a bomb on me.
That I am gonna to kick
Jared's butt here in a minute.
After you film for us, honey.
What the heck!
- I was sitting here and I was like,
did Jared bring you home
Krispy Kreme donuts,
and Ellie's face was like, what?
- I was like you went
and you didn't bring your
pregnant wife home a Krispy Kreme donut?
- First of all, it was Donut
Time with Jared and Joel,
not the spouses.
- Yeah, but he got one
to bring to his wife.
- I'm so--
- Anyway, thanks for
throwing me under the bus.
(laughing)
He got donuts for him,
that's what I was told.
-  Okay
- But I did bring you home something.
- You did.
He brought home Cheetos,
but they're not Cheetos.
-  They're cinnamon twists.
- They're cinnamon twists.
- Oh that's yummy.
-  It's not a Krispy Kreme donut.
- She was like eww, I don't want it
- Regardless, probably
should not have known that
my husband got a donut today and I didn't.
-  It was donut
time with Jared and Joel.
- He wants one.
Look at my belly, holy moly.
- I'm sorry that I'm married
to Jack from This is Us.
- Excuse me, excuse me.
I am Jack from This is Us.
You tell her.
- We have good husbands.
- Tell her right now.
- We have good husbands.
- Tell her right now.
- Jared is really good to me.
Jared and I are just getting ready
to go over the video for the night.
But I wanted to talk to you guys
about this morning, and I
wanted to ask you a question.
I'll ask you the question first.
Every pregnancy I've had,
I have been vlogging.
And I've been filming,
and I truly want to know
what you do, or what you've
done to relax in your pregnancy.
Or something that you've
done for yourself.
I've never done maternity photos,
and I wanna plan a one night getaway
when we do the maternity photos.
And me and Jared go do maternity pictures,
and then go stay somewhere,
do like massages together.
That's something that I would like to do,
that we've never done.
And so I've been thinking today.
it's kind of crazy that
I've filmed my pregnancies,
and I've filmed my
deliveries, and after birth.
It's just like what
have you done to relax,
or pamper yourself?
Or even at home.
Like sometimes, for me at home,
just to really enjoy my pregnancy.
I love just laying on my
bed, with my shirt up,
looking at my tummy.
And the kids are watching
shows by me and cuddling me.
I just like holding my
tummy, and feeling him move.
Just trying to take a few
minutes out of the day,
truly to just like enjoy
my pregnancy, you know?
That was that.
But this morning was a rare thing.
I completely, I was this close
to passing out this morning.
I was taking a shower, I
had just eaten breakfast.
And Jared was just getting
in as I was coming out,
and from my toes tingly
all the way to my head,
I literally went, I don't feel good.
And I was like, it's black.
Like I instantly fell into Jared's arms,
and like sat on the tile
floor for a few minutes.
I've never experienced that,
and it was the weirdest,
craziest, and scary thing.
- Yeah, and your face
was white as a ghost.
I literally like put my
arms under your arms,
and just held you.
Like I held you like a baby.
Just like grabbing you like that.
- It was weird.
- And we slowly went down
to the floor together.
- Like what if you
weren't there, you know?
-  Yeah.
- It was so fast.
Maybe the shower was hot.
I was taking a more hot
shower than I normally do.
I don't know, but it was just crazy.
So that's our day today.
I did wanna just ask you guys.
I told them like, all of our
pregnancies we've filmed,
and what do they do to relax?
Or what do they do to take
care themselves, you know?
-  Lush balls
- Baths, baths, I like that.
But, thank you guys so much
for watching our video today.
We will see you guys.
- Next time.
- See ya!
- Bye
