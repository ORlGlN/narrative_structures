-  Are we embarrassing
you by singing in public?
- Boys, come here, I want
to show you something.
- Look around.
-  Boys, you can't be back here.
- Oh no, it's the authorities.
-  Best fort ever!
- I'm just, yay, we're gettin' there.
And we're building forts and eating pizza!
- Good morning guys and happy Monday.
I hope you are having a great day.
I am sitting here in my office
and look, my office is clean
thank goodness gracious.
But Ellie called me and she told me
to be waiting for her,
because her and the boys have been out
running some errands and
doing some grocery shopping
and she informed me that we are about
to do the world's greatest Sam's Club run
of our lifetime.
We are going to stock
up on a bunch of stuff.
So she told me, she's
like Jared get ready,
and you wait, because
I'm gonna pick you up
and we're gonna go.
So I'm just waiting for Ellie right now
as we get ready to do this ultimate
shopping adventure extravaganza.
(whistling)
(groovy chill music)
I don't have a watch on.
Okay, she's here.
Let's go, oh.
Let's go.
Oh, I shouldn't jump, I shouldn't jump.
I've gotta tell you a quick story.
So this morning, I was getting out of bed
and we have a big pregancy pillow
on the side of our bed
that we are going to use for Ellie.
And I was trying to step over it today,
not to make any sound,
'cause it's in one of those vacuum bags.
'cause Bonnie and Joel had it,
and I stepped over it
and my foot slid out from under me
and my leg went crrruuk, like that.
I hyperextended my knee and my knee
has been killing me all day.
So I don't know if I tore anything,
other than my pants, right?
'Cause I'm wearing ripped jeans.
- I like those jeans.
- I think they look pretty good.
I like 'em.
So I can't jump down the stairs,
because my knee hurts really bad.
Anyway, are you ready for this
extreme extravaganza?
- Yes.
-  Of shopping.
- We are gonna go renew
our Sam's Club card.
- And we are going to stock up.
- Diapers?
- Wipes?
- Q-tips?
- Deodorant?
(sniffs)
- Totes.
- Magoats.
(Ellie laughs)
(muffles singing)
-  Are we embarrassing
you by singing in public?
- We are fueled up.
We just had lunch and we are ready
to rock and roll.
And we're starting in the
most important place of all.
We are stocking up on
the smelly good stuff,
deodorant, because let's face it Ellie,
we work so hard, we work up a sweat.
And that sweat starts to stink.
- I feel like every time we're like,
we need more, we run out fast,
so we're stocking up just
on everything we need.
- Everything.
Every last thing.
- We need more--
- And diapers.
- We need more nighttime gummies.
-  Nighttime gummies?
-  We ran out.
- We need to get more kids' vitamins, huh?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah that's right.
-  You want to make a fort?
- Yeah.
-  Well I don't know if Calvin's
gonna love it or hate it.
- We're gonna put a fort right here.
This is part of the fort.
- I wanna go--
-  You wanna sit in the fort.
Oh brother.
Oh my gosh.
- Alright,
-  That was just
piece one of the fort, okay?
-  We're gonna cover you guys up.
- There's a piece here and a piece here
and then you'll be golden, okay?
-  Are you smelling his head?
- No, I'm sniffing his hair in my nose.
-  Why, does it smell good?
- I'm trying to (muffled)--
(Ellie laughs)
-  Okay, we have a fort here.
I'm wondering what Dad has going on here.
- Boys, come here, I want
to show you something.
- Oh that's a fort?
-  Come here.
This is not sponsored by Charmin.
(Ellie laughs)
Ah!
Oh, I'm always left out.
Alright, are you guys
ready to join the fort?
Let's go, shoop.
- What do we do now?
-  This is our club
guys, we're in the club house.
- Wow.
- Yeah, is this cool or what?
What should we do while we're in here?
- See.
-  Do you see the bear?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- Look around.
-  You boys,
you can't be back here.
- Oh no, it's the authorities.
- If you're gonna be back here,
you have to buy every one of them.
- Ahh Mom!
(Ellie growls)
I think someone saw me in here.
We have to be so quiet, okay?
We can't let anyone see us.
(yelling)
Ellie, here's the new challenge.
We're staying in Sam's Club for 24 hours,
in our toilet paper fort.
- Okay, goodbye.
- Bye.
Now let's stay here as
long as we can, okay?
What should we do for a day?
- Do for a day.
- No I don't want to stay here forever.
- You don't?
- No.
- I thought we were gonna
stay here the whole day.
-  No.
- Why not?
You want to go with Mom then?
-  No.
- Oh okay, you do?
Okay.
- Hey.
-  You want to stay?
- Pong.
-  You want to go?
- I'm gonna knock the gate over.
- Uh-oh, no no no, don't
knock the gate over.
No!
Alright, we're leaving it there
and we're just puttin' em all back up,
in case someone else wants
to use the secret fort.
- So we stocked up and
got a year's worth supply
of toothpaste and just
some household products
that we need, so we can
put in our storage room
and Calvin has not had an accident.
We've been gone a lot of the day.
I brought his potty
and he just went potty.
And I'm so proud of him.
He has not gone potty yet.
Where did Jared go?
There you are.
- I was just admiring my
tetrissing of all of our stuff.
-  You did amazing.
- That's a year's worth of supplies
we got in the backseat or the trunk
and that's some dad skill right there.
The key to building a fort Jackson,
there's a couple things.
You need to get a good solid foundation,
but you also want to maximize your space,
so finding that balance
is one of the biggest keys
into fort building, right?
- Yeah.
- So we need to get blankets,
we need to get pillows, but
we also need to arrange--
- I got a pillow.
- Oh good job, you're
already ahead of schedule.
But we also need to find that good balance
to where we can get in and out and around
and have a good club area
and that sort of thing.
Maybe even a flushable toilet.
We'll figure out
somethings that we can do.
But I feel like this is a good place
to start building and
to start our foundation.
- I'm gonna start building.
- You got it.
(playful guitar music)
Alright I think we've got the foyer,
grand entrance hall done.
We've got a sloped roof right here.
But that's not it,
I've got ideas for expansion.
And that's the thing,
you gotta start small, but
then you've got to expand
once things are going well.
You can't keep yourself too comfortable.
if you're comfortable, you're not growing.
So we've got this back area right here,
I call it the back 40,
we're gonna try and
get that filled in here
to get some more livable space.
And then once we're done with that--
Oh, you got an idea?
Ooh look at that bungee.
Then, I'm thinking, you always need
a good escape route, okay?
You got your back 40 here.
You got the door workin'?
- Uh-huh.
- Good job.
-  And then we've got
our escape route right here.
We've gotta get all of that roofed.
You think you can help me with that bud?
- Yeah.
(playful guitar music)
-  Okay, look at
that square footage Jackson.
Look at that.
That is something to be proud about.
You helped me with this,
Calvin you helped me with this.
Look, it's almost done guys.
Do you like it Calvin?
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know, I think we've made
some really big improvements
from the last fort that
we created down here.
We have a lot less materials used,
we have a lot more livable space,
and it's an open concept.
What do you think Jackson?
- It's great.
- Oh good, I'm so glad you like it.
We got our flashlights.
-  Okay, go get in the fort.
- I'm so glad you like it.
Yay Calvin.
What if we order a
pizza and watch a movie?
-  Yeah!
- That would be so fun.
- I wanna eat Cocoa Puffs.
- You want Cocoa Puffs?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
-  Best fort ever!
- Now that we've had the
fort done for awhile,
I think my favorite thing
is seeing Jackson and Calvin
play in the fort together.
- Is Mom allowed this time?
-  What do you guys
think, should Mom be allowed?
- Whoa.
- Look my thing.
- Watch a movie in here?
- Bolt.
- Bolt?
- And eat pizza.
- We don't have pizza.
- We can go get some.
Is Dad gonna go get some?
- You bet I am.
- Is Dad gonna go get pizza?
- You bet I am!
You've been working hard,
gettin' all those things.
Let's show 'em what you've done.
- Okay, ever since Jared
and I have been married,
when we first got married,
we tried to save and have
two months of rent ahead,
just as an emergency,
and we've always tried to do that.
And then over the years
we've tried to increase that amount
up to five months, in case we lose a job
or in case something happens,
we have an emergency fund.
So we've always tried
to do that financially,
but we also have always tried
to have extras on hand.
With our church, we've always been told
emergency preparedness,
always be prepared.
And my dad, he had this
steady job for 30 years,
his retirement was ahead,
everything was in line
and then a slap in the face,
he got laid off.
And for a full year, my mom and dad lived
off of their storage.
They kept a storage for 30 years,
never had to use it,
but they used it just in
the habits of having extras
and they would go through it and use it
and then restock.
But when my dad lost his job,
they spent a year using
all their toilet paper,
their chocolate chips for
chocolate chip cookies,
their flour for bread.
They just lived off of it.
And my dad said that's what saved us.
So when we've been in
our small apartments,
I have always tried to have
10 extra cans of beans,
or 10 extra cans of stuff
that we know that we use,
and we cycle through and use.
So now that we've been
in our house for a year,
that's something that's
been a goal of ours.
is to stock up and have a year's supply
of everything we need.
And we haven't quite done that yet,
but this year is what I'm trying to do
is get that, every month try
and buy extra cans of food
and my biggest goal is to get the kids
and Jared and I, 72-hour kits right here.
So just like boom boom 72 hour kits.
We haven't always had space to do this,
in our last place we
happened to have a garage,
so we had some stuff there,
but in our small apartments
we didn't have room,
but we would at least try
and have a few things,
like we'd have one extra hairspray
or five extra cans of food.
And we try and always have
some sort of preparedness.
So today I'm really proud of us.
We don't have a ton of food storage wise,
but we do have a year's supply
of paper towels and toilet paper.
We have a two year supply
of shampoo and conditioner,
tons of feminine products, Q-tips, soaps,
we got tons of deodorant, some hairsprays
and then just the stuff that
we just go through really fast.
We got a lot of baby wipes.
We bought one of these a year ago
and it took us a full
year to go through it,
it just has tons and
tons of baby wipes in it.
We bought two of those,
because with the new baby coming,
we'll definitely be going through more.
So I feel really good.
This has been a goal of ours
that we're trying to go for.
And my next goal is 72 hour kits and food,
like water, that should probably have been
our first thing that we had in here,
but we need a few gallons
of water, just in case.
Crap happens, that's why
when we bought the house
Jared got a generator for the electricity
and internet and stuff.
That's one thing that we
bought for preparedness.
That's our goal, that's
what we've been doing.
We're slowly but surely getting there.
You know, over the years,
we've been married for, I think
this year's our ninth year
or something, we've been
married eight years.
Our whole marriage, that's something
that we've worked towards,
just emergency preparedness
in ever aspect of our life,
So I'm just yay, we're getting there.
And we're building forts and eating pizza!
-  Alright guys, look what I have.
- Pizza.
-  We didn't have Cocoa Puffs,
but we've got pizza with cookies.
Pizza with cookies, just like you wanted.
Hey, this is a special treat.
We're probably never ever ever ever ever
gonna do this again, so let's enjoy it
while we can, okay guys?
Should we put on the movie?
Have some pizza?
Call it a good time?
Yeah boy.
(chill guitar music)
Alright the kids are in bed
after our adventure in forts.
We had a fort in the store,
we had a fort in the basement
and it was just the best,
it was so much fun.
We are wrapping up our night.
Ellie is watching The Bachelor.
Is it The Bachelor or The Bachelorette?
- Bachelor, I'm painting my nails.
-  Oh diggity dang, girl.
You've got some fly nails.
- I've been tweeting all about it
and instagramming it.
It's a new color.
-  Mmm-hmm.
-  I tried it from Butter London.
My first time ever using their polish.
-  They look as smooth as butter.
- And it's called Mum's the Word.
If you want to know.
- Mom's the Word, the color?
-  Yeah.
-  Cool.
- I'm so proud of my nails.
- I am too, I would be,
they look really healthy
and strong, Ellie.
-  Thank you.
- My knee still hurts,
if you guys were wondering.
-  Oh I'm sorry.
- I'm gonna give it a couple days.
If it doesn't get any better,
if I still feel this sharp pain,
I'm gonna go have it looked at.
Because honestly, I may
have, not completely torn,
but maybe torn it just a little bit.
Anyway, that's gonna be
it from us tonight guys.
Thank you so much for watching the video.
If you enjoyed it, give it a big thumbs up
and we will see you tomorrow bye.
I caught you in a yawn this time.
I caught her in a yawn!
