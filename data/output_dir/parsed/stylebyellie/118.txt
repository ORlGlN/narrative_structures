- Yeah.
- Woo!
(bright music)
- Of course, we walk
into the movie theater
and we have trouble as
soon as we get in here.
- There is a baby in Mommy's tummy.
- How do you feel about that?
- It's weird that we're talking about it.
(laughing)
- You got me so good!
- Fresh strawberries in your oatmeal
in the morning is the best.
I love it.
I also love, seeing my cute
boys next to the fireplace.
- Is the fireplace warm?
-  Hi cuties.
Jared's like don't film me,
I don't have a shirt on.
- I don't have a shirt on.
-  How many times have
you come in and filmed me,
and I'm like Jared.
- Um probably a lot more than
you've done that to me, so.
(laughing)
- You're cute.
- Fine.
-  Jackson, what
are we doing today?
- We're going to the movie theater.
- Yay.
What are we gonna see?
- A movie.
- Oh good.
(laughing)
- Alright does anyone out there,
especially people that have dogs,
feel like they need more than one vacuum.
I think I've even talked
about this before,
but I am like, okay,
so I cleaned our vacuum today
and I usually clean it like once month,
this is the filter,
and I just rinse it out and then I clean.
Half of it is like the kids,
you know, cleaning up messes.
The other day, they decided
to play in the Nesquik
mixer stuff, so like this
was full of chocolate stuff.
I had to clean it, and it was gross.
And especially with Penny,
I feel like it's important
to clean the filter
and to clean the hair out,
so I have a clean vacuum
while I'm cleaning.
Anyway, and now I'm like, I need a vacuum,
(laughs)
for like the kids' breakfast this morning,
there's stuff everywhere.
But that takes 24 hours to dry,
so I'm like hmmm.
Anyway, that's something
I always think about,
I'm like I swear I need another vacuum,
but I think that sounds like crazy.
But it's not, because I would use it.
Anyway, we are getting ready for the day.
We're getting things cleaned up.
Jared's working, Penny's
chewing on a chew toy.
- Wow wow wow.
- Kids are playing in the window sill.
What are you guys talking about?
- Bow wow wow.
Watch, see?
(scrambling cars)
(vroom vrooming)
-  Oh,
(Ellie laughs)
Did you hit your head?
(vroom vrooming)
(scrambing cars)
Careful.
Look at his shirt, everyone.
- Me.
-  That was Jackson's last year.
All of Jackson's sweaters last year
are fitting Calvin.
It's a 3T mister.
That looks good.
- Now I'm too big.
-  And now you're too big.
Good grief, why did you decide to grow up?
What?
(Calvin fusses)
You don't like your brother's shirt?
- Ow.
(cries)
-  He wants to pull it up.
This is a shirt you don't pull up,
don't pull at that please.
- Why?
-  Because it'll break it.
You don't want to break it.
Yeah, be soft.
- Are those the pine cones?
-  Yeah, 'cause, don't break it.
You guys have your toys
and if Mommy were to take your cars,
yeah you be soft,
and throw one, that would break your cars.
I don't want you to break Mom's stuff,
'cause that wouldn't be nice.
- If you break my stuff,
I will be angry.
- Yeah and if you break
my stuff, I'll be angry.
So let's just not break
each other's stuff, okay?
Perfect.
Thank you.
I thought you looked
really cool in that shirt.
- We break monsters.
-  We what?
- We break monsters.
-  We break monsters?
- Yeah.
- That sounds like a great idea.
Tell monsters not to come in my house?
- No.
-  Yeah.
We only have happy
monsters here, like him.
(Ellie laughs)
Huh?
- Yes, I agree with whatever you said.
I don't know what it is, but I agree.
- Hi Miss Penny, good morning.
- Mommy baby, Mommy Mommy.
- What?
- Baby it's home.
- Our baby's in my tummy.
- No, this Mommy baby home.
-  Mommy baby home.
- No, this Mommy hold.
- Mommy hold the baby?
- Uh-huh.
-  Yeah.
(Calvin vocalizing)
- Are you my baby too?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  Does Mommy have another baby?
- No it's Dad's baby.
- Dad's baby.
- Dad's baby.
(laughing)
- Okay, I know Dad's
packing on a few pounds,
but that's a little too far Calvin.
-  That's hilarious.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
- Woo!
- I did finally let
the cat out of the bag,
that you guys know.
- It's weird to talk about.
- This is so exciting.
- I know it's weird to have the vlog out
and I guess to talk about it.
- Like look at my tummy right now.
-  Oh my goodness Ellie.
(laughing)
Oh my goodness gracious.
- This is the first day
I'm wearing maternity pants
and it's really really early,
but it's only because I want to be comfy
-  Yeah!
- all the time.
-  Oh I don't blame you one bit.
- I don't want any restrictions anywhere.
- Of course we walk into the movie theater
and we have trouble as
soon as we get in here.
- Ellie and Jared.
-  Oh, we've got trouble makers,
troublemakers at the movie theater.
- Jackson!
- Yeah!
(Jared laughs)
-  You guys excited?
- Guess what we're watching?
- What?
- A skeleton movie.
- Coco.
- See that, see that on the movie--
-  Okay, are you
guys ready for this?
- We are, yeah and it was hilarious.
(laughs)
-  Let me see your picture.
- Jackson's the only one--
-  Jackson, I'm
gonna take your picture.
-  Oh look at Cody's face.
(soaring music)
(Jared laughs)
I'm spilling all the popcorn.
Well we had one person
not quite make it through.
- Thank goodness.
I was like, we are gonna take you out,
and then he fell asleep.
-  He is so zonked out.
He made it about halfway through.
Okay boys, let's wait over
here by the door, okay?
Right over here.
We made it back from the movie.
I loved it.
I really really liked it.
Oh we're walking in the dark now.
Let's flip that switch.
Ellie, what'd you think of the movie?
- It was a cute story.
-  It was.
- Did you like it Cal?
-  Yeah, you kind
of missed the whole part--
- It was kind of bad timing.
-  Yeah.
(Jared laughs)
- It was fun.
- It was really cute, the
music was really great.
I do have one complaint.
It's not really a valid complaint,
but I'm gonna do it.
The whole, every time
Disney Pixar has a movie,
they have a short beforehand.
It was like a Frozen one,
and it was like a little two long.
- I'm sorry Frozen, it was
like a 30 minute Frozen film.
- Yeah and so usually they have
like these really short ones
that are perfect and cute and fun.
This was cute, a little too long,
You know, just for the
kids, in my opinion.
Anyway, speaking of kids, what
are you guys doing down here?
(yelling)
(banging on box)
(laughing)
There's something in this box
and I'm afraid to see what it is.
Should we see what's inside?
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
What is inside of the box?
It's Cody.
(Jared laughs)
- I kept hitting my head.
-  Gosh, who
needs all of these toys,
when you have a box, right?
- So when we were at the theaters,
we got notification on
our security system,
and I was like who is at our house,
like the security is on.
There's a cat outside.
There's a cat outside.
Jared we should let Penny outside.
(Ellie laughs)
But now the cat's probably gonna run.
- Come on Penny, let's go outside.
-  Oop it's on the rocks.
(Ellie laughs)
Penny.
- Did you see it jump over the fence?
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
She missed it.
Anyway, we got an alarm,
and I was like, what the heck,
and Jared was like, oh it's Mom and Dad,
I'm like, oh, wonder what they're doing.
I noticed, so last year
Jared's mom made this for me,
and then I noticed that
this was sitting under it.
She totally bought me a runner.
-  Isn't that cute?
- That is so cute.
She went to Freckle Farm,
and I told her she has to go there,
because she would love it.
And I'm pretty sure this
is where she got it.
It's so cute, thank you.
We need to call you and
officially say thank you,
but thank you to the vlogs.
- Crap!
Pull the camera out before you guys leave,
Hold on, don't leave yet.
Don't leave yet guys.
Hi, I said don't go out the door.
Linc?
Everyone come back inside,
we need to have fun.
-  It's a party
'til we walk out the door.
- We didn't pick up the camera once.
Bonnie and Joel and the
kids have all been here
and we've been partying,
so I want you guys to use your imagination
and just pretend like you were there,
while we were there,
doing that kind of stuff.
You know what I'm saying?
- Fun was had by all.
- How many times did our cousins leave,
and we jumped in the back of the car,
so we could go spend the night with them.
-  Ooh.
- And Jackson just left.
- A few.
-  Is he jumping
in the back of the pickup?
- He's crawling down the stairs.
-  Oh gee boys, hey,
-  Jackson.
-  Hey, don't you get in the truck.
Oh that is exactly what he is doing.
(Jared laughs)
Go get him Mom.
Oh no.
Mom's faster than you.
Hey, what do you think
of our Christmas lights?
-  It's very nice.
-  Very nice?
-  Oh and I scared
you when we first came.
- Oh my gosh, I'll see if I
can grab the footage of that.
Olivia scared me so bad when she came.
She totally ding dong pranked me.
It was so funny.
(playful suspenseful music)
(Jared yells)
(Jared laughing)
- You got me so good.
But we got the Christmas lights.
They're natural daylight blue,
versus the warm yellow.
Or something like that.
I don't know, I like 'em a lot.
You can see 'em in my office window too.
-  Can I have a hug?
- Absolutely, thanks for
coming over sister sue.
Bye Bon, bye guys.
Adios muchachos.
Hey guys,
♪ Remember me ♪
That's one of the songs from Coco.
-  Bye.
- Bye.
Coco was actually a really good movie.
It brought tears to my
eyes, it really did.
Hey pregnant lady, how are you feeling?
- Hi.
-  Can you believe
we're talking about it?
- It's weird.
- It's so weird.
We haven't been talking
about it for like a month,
and now it's out in the open.
How are you feeling pregnant lady?
(Penny barking)
- Penny wants to come in.
Jackson's ready for second dinner.
I'm pooped, because I just chased Jackson
through the neighborhood.
- I know.
- I want this open.
-  You know what buddy,
that's actually not yogurt,
that's sour cream and
it would not taste good.
- Uncle Beau doesn't like sour cream.
- Daddy doesn't really like sour cream.
Would sour cream be bad,
as a non connoisseur of sour cream,
would taking a spoonful of
sour cream be bad to eat?
- That's--
- That's kind of gross.
It's like mayonnaise, right?
You just don't eat a
spoonful of mayonnaise,
most people don't anyway.
- Alright, let's get these kids to bed.
- Alright.
Hi buddy.
- Hi.
- Did you have a good day today?
- Yeah.
- Good, what was your
favorite part about the day?
- Doing the movie theater.
- That was fun, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hey, do you remember
what we did this morning?
- Mmm.
- Did you remember when Mommy and Daddy
sat you down on the couch?
- Yeah.
- What did we tell you?
- There is a baby in Mommy's tummy.
- How do you feel about that?
- I don't know.
- Are you excited?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you excited to have
a brother or a sister?
(laughs)
Good I'm so happy that you're excited.
You have been such a good
big brother for Calvin
and I know you're gonna
be a good big brother
for our next baby.
- Yeah.
- I love you buddy.
- I love you.
- Do you want a brother or sister?
- Brother.
- Brother?
Uncle Matt says he thinks
we're gonna have a boy too.
- He already has a boy.
- He has three boys.
Do you know they're gonna have a baby too?
- Yeah.
- And Aunt Jen is gonna have a baby.
And Aunt Emily is gonna have a baby.
And our other Aunt
Emily's gonna have a baby.
And Aunt Julie's gonna have a baby.
There's a lot of babies
in our family right now.
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's pretty cool huh?
I just want you to know
that I'm grateful for you.
And how good you are to your brother
and how nice you are to your cousins.
And how good you are at
being a good listener.
I love that you're my son, you know that?
- Yeah.
- I love you buddy.
- I love you.
- Okay, let's read a story
and we'll say goodnight to our friends.
- Okay, goodnight friends.
-  Are you waitin'
for me by the stairs?
Is that what you're doing, huh?
You waitin' for me?
That's a good girl.
Oh that's is like the best dog smile ever.
Aww look at that.
I love how she leans into it,
oh yeah, that's the spot.
Ellie, can we talk for a second?
I need to talk to you about your cravings.
You've had very specific
cravings this week.
Oh no!
You have had very specific
cravings this week.
And they all.
- First let me wipe this crap off.
- You turd.
- Oh geez, Penny.
- What a turd.
All of your cravings have involved cheese.
- What?
- Mac and cheese?
- Okay, and you want to know what,
that sounds disgusting.
-  It does, it kinda does.
- But I needed it.
- Nachos, broccoli,
- I really wanted salt.
- Like yeah.
So this is the first time Ellie,
and I think I mentioned this before,
but this is the first time
that Ellie has cravings that are like
very specific
- Legit cravings.
- and legit, like she hasn't
had very many cravings
where she's like, I need this right now,
except for this time.
Except for this time.
So it's definitely interesting
to compare the pregnancies,
you know?
- Well and I've told Jared,
like I don't want little snacks,
I need full blown meals every time I eat.
-  Yeah.
- I need five full blown meals a day.
-  Yeah.
- I am starving.
I'm starving and I'm sick
and if I don't eat
- And you're eating a ton.
- Like today I was like, I need lunch,
and it was 10 o'clock.
I had breakfast.
I ate, but I needed another meal at 10.
- And you had breakfast at nine.
(laughing)
- Yeah and then I rolled
out of bed at nine.
So it's just crazy.
It's crazy and exciting.
I'm trying to think what else.
It's weird that we're talking about it.
I feel a little weird today,
'cause we're like talking about it
and it feels kind of funny.
I have a bowl of mints
and Werther's to suck on,
because that's what I've been
eating too throughout the day.
-  To kind of keep
your taste buds satisfied
in between meals.
- Yeah.
-  Funny.
- Okay, let's go eat these chips.
We used to eat these all the time
-  Mmm-hmm, nachos.
- in college.
- But I have beans.
Doesn't that look so gross?
Here's your plate and here's mine.
-  Oh my gosh.
- And that is a wrap from us to you.
Our first official day of really talking
about the pregnancy.
We are so unbelievably excited.
There's a huge nervous part of me,
that is still very nervous.
It is still really early.
(Penny panting)
But I just have to keep telling myself,
things are good right now,
and be really happy and excited,
and I am,
but sometimes those nerves
in the back of my head
come forward and I get really anxious.
But, I am happy, I am excited,
I am sick.
(laughs)
I definitely haven't dry heaved,
and felt way way nauseous
the last few days.
I've just felt a little sick,
which has been awesome.
I love food, I love food.
Trying to drink a lot of water right now.
This is crazy.
Jared just took Penny out,
because I think she was being really loud.
Thank you guys so much for watching
and I can't wait for this
next chapter in our life.
The last few months have
been a whirlwind of emotions
and I really hope and pray
that this pregnancy goes safe.
So thank you guys.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
