-  I'll give you
my pickle, for a nickel.
(laughing)
- Why did you throw it at me?
- This guy's looking a little sad.
I got it Ellie, Ellie
I got it, don't worry.
Everyone, the floor is lava.
- It's definitely put me
in the holiday spirit.
I'm very excited for Thanksgiving.
Hi, what are you doing?
- (Calvin vocalizes)
- You're filming?
-  Yeah.
- Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree,
why are you up so early?
(laughing)
- Our tree is up.
- I know our tree is up
and we thought about this
and we're like, why don't
we put it up earlier?
We were actually talking
to Cullen and Katie
about this yesterday,
like let's put up our Christmas stuff,
or just the tree anyway, early,
because it kind of just
brings in the holiday spirit.
I know it's before Thanksgiving.
People might give us grief about it,
I don't care one bit, because it's fun.
- There's a big difference between having,
decorating your home
and making it feel cozy,
then jumping and running and doing the,
you know what I mean?
- The Christmas ornaments.
- Well no, not even ornaments, but,
it's just you do what you
need to do with your family.
-  You do you boo,
is that what you're saying?
- Yeah, I love Thanksgiving,
and I love getting
together with the family
and I just love the
feeling that it brings.
-  Yeah.
- I'm excited to put the wreath
on the stairs.
(bell dings)
-  Yeah.
- That's one of my favorite decorations.
- And the wreath in front of the garage.
Like that's gonna be so
stinking cool, it's huge.
But that's actually the plan
is we just have the tree up for now.
We're not gonna put any ornaments on it
until after Thanksgiving,
I think is the plan.
- So the other night when I woke up
and I couldn't sleep,
I was watching my friend Ashley Hughes.
She did a DIY of how to decorate your tree
and I feel like last year,
I did a really good job with our tree.
It was my first time really really trying
and after watching her video,
I'm like I'm gonna do ribbon this year.
I'm gonna get more--
- No.
- I'm gonna get more.
- It's too much Ellie.
- The ribbon is too much.
- No I am.
- It's gonna crinkle, it's gonna cross,
I can't do this.
- No I am,
-  I can't get behind you on this.
- And I cannot wait to decorate our tree
when the time comes.
-  I'll help you with the wreath
around the uh
(bell dings)
Is that called wreath?
(bell dings)
What do you call it around the stairwell?
I don't know.
(bell dings)
I'll help you with that.
You're on your own with the ribbon, sorry.
I'll give you my pickle, for a nickel.
(laughing)
- Why did you throw it at me?
I have a cold sore.
Do you see it?
- Aww.
- You know what, Ellie's
family gets cold sores,
like nobody's business.
Like everywhere, like
all around their lips
and their noses and everything,
but I don't get get cold sores.
- I don't, Julie and Beau
- I never
- Julie and Beau get them in their nose.
Bonnie just got some on her top lip.
Think about it, we just got
back from crazy changes,
crazy sleep changes
-  Yep going
right into the holidays.
- There's just lots going on, winter,
I have a cold sore, dangit.
- Yeah, I've never had a
cold sore in my entire life.
-  Come here.
(kissing)
- I kiss you all the
time and it doesn't work.
It's like a genetic thing.
- Well yeah it is, but my
mom didn't have cold sores
and now she does
because of my dad.
- Does she have them?
- I'm not kissing you anymore,
at least not until that bad boy is gone.
Let's call it Little Jared.
- Ew.
- So we're working on a
big project this weekend.
And I want to show you downstairs.
Everyone's just hanging
out here having lunch.
I heard some music,
are you gonna play us
a song and serenade us?
- I already did it, I
like it, it's awesome.
- Okay, anyone else have
the musical talent ability?
But I thought it was funny,
they're huddled down
there with the fireplace.
They turned it on because it
was a little chilly down there,
eatin' lunch, that's fun.
Mmmm.
(playful music)
Mmm, this guy's looking a little sad.
I got it Ellie.
Ellie I got it, don't worry.
-  Why is this so funny?
- I don't know.
(laughing)
-  Totally.
- You want me to do this one too?
-  Totally you do.
-  Much better.
(laughs)
Why is that the funniest thing?
- Oh we were sitting here laughing,
looking at that tree and I was like,
you should get some floss.
-  Floss will do the trick.
So it's like our trees out there,
they've got post holders,
so they grow upright and straight.
- I want to make a garage.
-  You want to make a garage,
want me to help you again?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, remember,
can you stack that into four?
Push that so it connects?
Perfect.
And then you can build the sides.
Perfect.
Yep, woop.
- I'm doing an audio
test with the microphone.
You can't see it, but it's right here.
-  We have a car
garage and what's this?
- A car washer.
-  A car washer.
Calvin, can you wash your car?
Oh, he wants to put his car
in the garage with yours.
This is our car wash.
They get washed,
they get dried, they get buffed,
and then they go into the car garage.
(playful music)
- Well I'm sitting in the car
and you're just sitting in the car,
you feel like you're invincible,
like no one can hear or see you.
-  You can fart and burp
all you want.
- I let out a burp
- and I've got my mic on
and the sound guy over here,
he looks at me he's like,
I hear that, and I was like oh no!
(laughing)
- Did you?
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Did you hear that?
-  Yes I got it.
- Are we gonna put ornaments on the tree?
-  Jared, that was hilarious.
That was so funny, I was
so embarrassed, like.
You can't get me.
I'm all the way up here,
you can't get me young man.
Whoa, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey whoa hey
hey hey hey whoa whoa whoa oh,
Mommy what am I gonna do?
Ahhh!
(laughing)
Everyone, the floor is lava.
Hurry the floor is
lava, the floor is lava.
- Did you guys have a good day today?
Say that's a wrap.
- Yeah.
- That's a wrap.
- Yeah, yay, we actually had
a lot of fun with the kids.
They did so good.
- I am so proud of my babies.
My parents and Jared's parents
helped watch the kids
a little bit yesterday
and today, while Jared and I filmed,
and it's definitely put
me in the holiday spirit.
I'm very excited for Thanksgiving
and very excited for
our project to come out.
Half of it is all about giving,
half of it is a different project.
I'm very very excited
for you guys to see what's coming out.
- Well and it's fun because
like we were planning on
putting up the tree today,
and I love being in the
holiday spirit already.
Like I was driving in the car today,
and they had Christmas music playing,
and I was just like, I
shouldn't be listening to this,
but I like it.
You know?
- Yeah.
- It was nice and I feel like I want
to be in that spirit more often,
you know?
- Yeah.
-  Totally.
Love you.
- I love you.
I'm glad we're doing
the holidays together.
- And Jared posted today on his Instagram,
which I thought was so cute,
he was like Ellie is not only
I don't even know where the kids went,
oh they're playing with them.
- They've got babysitters.
(laughing)
- Two people,
you guys are cute.
Thanks.
- I'm learning how to walk tonight.
- Nice.
- Awesome.
- Jared had posted on Instagram
and he was like, I'm just so grateful
that Ellie and I are not
only husband and wife,
but like we're co-workers.
And somebody had responded and was like,
that truly is a blessing,
my parents worked together for 20 years,
and your parents worked together.
- Yep.
- And there's so many pros
and cons about everything
that anyone does,
and I just think that one of
the biggest pros of what we do
is that I do get to see your face all day.
- 'Cause I got a pretty
good looking face, don't I?
I mean, I get a little
bored of it.
- That's not what I meant.
- People are gonna click off.
That's not what I meant.
- I know.
- Look at my cold sore.
I meant I'm grateful that
I get to see my family.
- Absolutely.
- A lot, that's a huge pro,
that's the biggest pro.
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.
I was making a joke.
- I know, I'm a little hangry
at the very of the, everyone shhh.
Let me, I gotta wrap up.
- I gotta do my line,
I'm hungry.
- gotta do my line.
- Okay I'm gonna eat or I'll
- We're gonna eat Tandoori Oven,
which is delicious.
- Bite somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm angry and hungry.
- You can bite me.
(growling)
- Hi, what are you doing?
(Calvin exclaims)
You're filming?
-  Yeah.
- You're crazy.
(Calvin laughs)
-  And suddenly, everyone is gone.
We have an empty house.
(gentle guitar music)
Where is everyone?
Penny and I went to go run a quick errand
and there's a couple things that I learned
when I was on that errand.
One, it is really cold outside.
I think it was down to 25 degrees
Fahrenheit outside tonight.
Two, this coat and this
dog do not mix very well.
Penny loves this.
I don't know why, but she
was in the car with me
and she jumped from the
backseat to the front
and was chewing this like crazy.
And I was like no no no, I'm oh.
So anyway, don't wear
this coat around Penny.
I'm still getting used
to having the tree up.
It was nice getting it set up
and feel that feeling you get
when you put up a Christmas tree.
And like I said earlier,
I like having that holiday
spirit that's around, earlier.
It just brings the spirit
of giving on my mind
all the more, and that's why I'm excited
about these projects that
we've been working on,
is that it's all centered around giving
and giving back, and I can't wait
for you guys to see it.
And like I said, we'll let you know
exactly when things are happening,
but I wanted to ask you specifically,
what puts you in the holiday spirit,
the sprit of giving,
the spirit of gratitude?
What does that for you,
and what do you like to
do to give back to others?
That's something that Ellie
and I want to make a tradition,
is every year we want to
do something to give back.
And we've got a lot of
things planned this year
that I'm very excited about.
And it's gonna be a good holiday season
and I can't wait for that.
And I can't wait for Penny
to play in the snow again.
She is loving life right now.
She's such a good dog.
Hey, hey, you being a good girl?
But yeah I've got an empty
quiet house right now.
Well it's not empty, everyone's asleep
and all the crew is gone,
so I think I'm gonna call it a night.
Thank you guys for watching.
I hope you have a wonderful day
and we will see you next time.
Penny, can you say bye bye?
Bye guys.
Bye guys, oh no no no,
don't chew that, no no, bye.
