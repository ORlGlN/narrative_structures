- Good morning Calvin.
(Jared laughs)
This little kid, oh my gosh,
we've been running around the entire house
getting everything packed and ready to go
to get out of here on time.
Cleaning, doing dishes, doing laundry
filling up jugs with chocolate milk.
And the peace that Calvin has
is just kinda something sweet.
We are getting ready to say goodbye
to our vacation home, we're
getting everything packed
and ready to go.
Joel, I just want to let you know
that I had a really nice time.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that,
I should not have done that.
- That warms my heart that you said that.
That's good praise.
And Jared, I always have a
really nice time with you.
(laughing)
- Eww, I was feeling a little left out.
That's a little close
in the morning, Jare!
-  Sorry Bonnie,
we'll put the filter on.
(laughing)
-  Make a filter on it.
- Bonnie, I also had a really nice time.
- Thank you.
-  Hey, that's my
wife you're talking about.
- Joel, I didn't wink,
I didn't wink.
- Oh.
- I didn't do that.
- So we'll see you in two
minutes as we carpool.
- Goodbye St. George.
- Goodbye St. George, we had fun,
- Goodbye St. George.
- and we're closing the door.
- Did you hear Calvin?
- What did he say?
- Say it loud.
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!
Let's lock this oh.
We're gonna lock this guy.
How do you lock it?
There we go.
Okay, alright, now we can say goodbye.
Goodbye house, we had so
much fun in St. George.
It was nice and warm, compared to Utah.
(bell dings)
And we're heading back up north.
-  Are you tired?
Do you want to close your
eyes 'til we get there?
Okay.
- Close your eyes.
- Okay goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- We'll see how long that actually lasts.
I think they will be asleep soon.
They've been going to
sleep at like 11 o'clock
in the morning.
Yes.
- Oh at 11 in the morning.
-  I was like they have not been up
'Til 11 at night.
- No, sorry,
- they've been taking a nap
at like 11 in the morning,
because they've been so tired,
because they play play.
And we've been putting them to bed,
except one night, like on bed time,
but they just have been playing so hard.
- Yeah, I love that they've been playing
and having as much fun as we have.
Like that's the fun part about a trip,
it's like Ellie and I have
been having a ton of fun
and the kids have been
having a ton of fun.
That's how you know,
it's a good trip.
-  He's out for the count.
What about you?
-  All you have to
do is pretend to be asleep
- No!
- and then it may happen.
-  No?
Okay, close your eyes.
Close 'em.
Goodnight.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Six
and a half hours later.
- Home sweet home,
it always feels good to walk in
to your house, and where--
there is Jared, Jared
and Penny are playing,
getting some exercise in.
I--
wait, where's your baby?
Where's your baby?
Where'd your baby go?
- Where baby go?
-  Where did you baby go?
Calvin came home and grabbed his baby.
Where's the bottle?
And he started feeding his baby.
Oh, there's the bottle.
He started feeding his baby.
- Did he really?
-  Yeah.
Let me see your baby, Cal.
Is that baby brother?
Yeah, and guess what else Calvin did?
When I got Calvin out of his car seat,
he goes, potty.
And I was like, do you need to go potty?
And he sat on the toilet
and he went everything.
He went potty, I'm so proud of him.
- It's just a great new year,
is what it is.
- Yes, the last several times
he's had to go poo,
he's gone in the toilet
and I'm so proud of him.
But we need to get everybody's haircuts.
-  Yep.
- I'm so proud of Calvin.
Such a relief when they start asking
and they're doing so well.
I think what I'm gonna do
is it's cold outside
and the garage is really cold.
I think I'm going to move this stuff,
cut everyone's hair and then clean this,
and then move it all back,
because in here needs to be cleaned.
- That's great for me,
because I don't want
to get my hair cut when it's cold outside.
- Yeah and the kids would be miserable.
They would be like I'm not having this so,
we'll do that, and then afterwards,
Mama's gonna pamper herself.
- Bottle!
-  The bottle?
Are you feeding the baby?
- Uh-huh.
- Oh cool.
- Mama.
-  What?
Is that your Batman book?
- Look at this.
- Oh the scary joker?
Our little trip turned out to be,
hey, nobody get ready for three days
and it actually was amazing,
but tonight, I'm gonna show you guys
what I've been doing with my nails
to get them so pretty and long.
They have a hint of yellow
because I've been using a nail polish
and then I had gotten into the hot tub
and it kinda made them a little yellow,
but I'm gonna show you what
I've been doing with them.
- Baby bottle.
-  What are you guys doing?
Were you guys feeding the baby?
- Yeah.
-  Are you excited
to have a baby brother?
Another little brother?
I think that you're gonna
want to hold him a lot.
- I want to hold him too much.
-  You think you will?
- Uh-huh.
-  You know how you ask me
to snuggle you and watch movies?
- Yeah.
-  Do you think
the baby will snuggle you
and watch a movie?
- Yeah.
-  I bet he will.
I think that will be so fun.
-  I want to
watch a movie right now.
- Right now?
-  Yeah.
- We've been in the car all day,
I think that's a negative.
I think we should get ready to do haircuts
and then take a nice warm bath.
Welcome to my salon today.
Ready Jackson?
- Yep.
(razor buzzing)
- Okay.
Look all the way down at your toes.
A little further, perfect.
Holy cow, you had some long hair.
(bright guitar music)
You know I've been cutting your hair
since you were just like nine months old.
Can you believe that?
You were just little.
- I'm not little.
- Not any more, but you were.
When I started to cut your hair,
when you were just a little baby.
- But then I was crying?
- No, you did so good.
When you were a baby
and I'd cut your hair,
I was worried that you would cry.
But you didn't cry, you did so good.
And I used to do this,
when you were a baby.
And I'd say see?
It doesn't hurt.
- Yeah.
- See how it doesn't hurt.
That's most of the time why babies cry,
it's because they're worried,
- Uh-huh, they are worried.
- 'Cause it's kinda loud.
(bright guitar music)
- No.
- Okay turn your body this way.
(bright guitar music)
- It's 2018.
It's about time we did this.
You guys know on our camera,
it's not the best camera.
The focus is going in and out like crazy,
there are dead pixels,
and if you don't know what that means,
I'll show you right now.
When I put this right here,
you'll notice that there's like
two or three,
(bell dings)
maybe even four spots that are not black,
those are dead pixels.
That means that the information
that the camera is filming
does not transfer through the sensor.
And it just shows up as a red dot
on the LCD or whatever you're viewing at.
So like I said, it's about time
we got a new camera.
I have been waiting for Canon to announce
a new G7X, like Mark III or whatever,
something that is good quality,
that's pocketable, for almost a year.
This camera has been able for nearly
two and a half years, two years?
But we've had it ever since it came out
and I'm just dying for Canon to come out
with another one.
I've tried the Sony RX100 Mark IV and V,
and didn't like it,
just because the flip
up screen right here,
it gets cut off and just everything isn't
as fluid and as easy as the G7X.
Sometimes, like when we were in St. George
at the Mars area, we filmed with this
and it looks really great,
but you just can't put that
in your pocket and film
whenever you want.
So like I said, we're just going back
to the G7X Mark II, a new version.
Hopefully you'll be able to tell
what it looks like.
In fact, let's switch over to it right now
in three, two, one,
and here we are.
Hopefully this looks at
leas a little bit better,
and hopefully the focus
is a little bit faster,
hopefully there's no dead pixels.
I do want to show you.
Oh, actually I think the
crop is off a little bit,
I need to change the
stabilization settings,
but I have to show you this other camera
that we've been using
for such a long time,
the condition that it's in.
So right here, you can see
there's so many cracks in that screen
and then this doesn't
even close all the way.
You see that all the way
around, and then up top.
I've even gone as far
as to replace the screws
on this paneling,
so right here and right here,
and I'm missing the pins
right here and right here.
Do you see how wobbly that is?
That's what that does.
So it's just been loved to death.
I mean we drop it in
the snow all the time.
But it's about time we got a new camera,
so hopefully it looks at least
just a little bit better.
And for those of you who don't know,
this is the camera that we use
when we film our normal regular vlogs,
is the Canon G7X Mark II.
If you have other questions about filming,
or anything like that,
I think it'd be fun to do a vlog
or a series on my channel,
as far as what we do
for filming and editing
and the whole process.
Hey bud.
- Hi.
-  How are you?
- Good.
- Good, your hair cut looks so fresh,
so smooth, so good.
-  You working?
I'm good to go do my nails?
- Yes you can go do your nails.
- I will not drop the camera.
When was the last time we got a new one?
- It's been a few months,
that one's taken quite a beating.
- When you do daily videos,
your camera gets some
good wear and tear on it.
Growing up, my mom always
had long fingernails.
She hardly painted them,
she never did anything like fake nails,
she just had naturally long,
really pretty nails.
And I mean she would clean the house,
she'd do yardwork and her
nails never seemed to break
and I've always envied that about her.
And I always wanted long nails
and I've never really
taken care of my nails,
because I was in the salon
and they were always wet
and I would always just
file them really short
and then with kids and
they're always in water
and I'm cleaning,
and it just seems like I just can't ever
seem to grow them out.
So I've tried to take
advantage of being pregnant,
being on pre-natal
pills, my hair and nails
growing like crazy.
And I've been really proud of them.
I have had many people notice them
and say, wow you're nails
look really healthy.
Jinger did this week,
I thought that was so nice.
Like I said, they have
a little yellow hint
to them, because I have
clear nail polish on
and I had gotten in the hot tub.
They're kind of dingy.
So what I usually do to keep them up,
and it sounds really high maintenance,
because it is right now,
but if I'm not on top
of them every few days,
one of them will break
and then it's like, I have to start over.
So every four days, I will
remove the clear polish,
I will buff 'em a little bit
and hardly file them.
Just so they are smooth.
And then I don't just
put clear coat on them,
I put a strengthener on them,
this is an Essie
strengthener that I put on.
In the past I've always
used just clear nail polish
on top, just to give it a barrier,
so they're not just like raw nails
prone to break and split and stuff.
And I've had two nails split
and I've just filed them smoothly.
I try and keep cuticle oil on them
when I remember.
And I've just been doing a really good job
and that's one thing I've always wanted
and I'm really proud of myself
that I've been able to
keep some healthy nails.
But yeah, I do that every four days,
just so I can keep them up,
but I'm sure once they're
at a really good length
and I can get 'em to be really strong,
I won't have to do it that often, so.
Yep, that's what I'm doing.
I've been watching my friend
the Healthy Grocery Girl,
her pregnancy update, while
I've been doing my nails.
This is the final product.
This is what they look like.
Look how long and smooth they are.
And then this is this hand.
I am so proud of them.
I think it's been five weeks
since I've started this
and they are at a really good length
and they just look really healthy,
I'm so proud.
- It's 10:16 in the evening
and I've got my work buddy
by my side, hi Penny.
And the rock tumbler is
going on in the background.
I think Penny senses that I'm a little,
I don't know, just sad.
I'm reminiscing.
I am editing the--
(laughs)
I am editing the New
Year's video right now
and I'm going through our year
that Ellie and I went through.
And every time I go through
these miscarriage videos, the D&C,
it just ah--
I don't think you ever lose that emotion
or that pain.
And I'm just really grateful
that we were able to overcome that
and be where we are now.
There's so many lessons that Ellie and I
have learned as a couple together
to go through these moments in our life.
And also just seeing the happy laughter,
the joy that we've had over 2017.
It's been wonderful.
It literally has been the highest of highs
and the lowest of lows.
And I wouldn't have it any other way.
If we don't experience the lows,
we won't know the joy that we can have.
And I'm grateful for it.
I'm grateful that we've captured it,
as difficult as some of this has been,
I'm grateful that we
have it to look back on.
Life can be hard.
Life can be fun.
Life can be so many of these things.
So many different things can happen to us.
All I know is that I am so grateful
that I have my family with me
to go through life.
And I cannot wait for 2018.
We're in it right now,
and it's going to be a wonderful year.
Thank you guys so much for watching
the video today.
I hope you have a wonderful 2018.
I hope you have some great goals
that you guys are going to accomplish
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
