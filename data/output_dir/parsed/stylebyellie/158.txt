-  Oh my goodness.
Hi Lumberjack, I mean Lumbercalvin.
This is Jackson's old hat.
You guys may remember it from Halloween
one or two years ago,
but he wore it for his Lumberjack costume
and now Calvin's wearing it.
And he just looks so stinking cute.
-  I'm gonna roll to you.
-  What?
You're gonna role to me?
- Yeah, watch
-  Okay, I'm watching.
Rollin' rollin' rollin'.
- I love this time of year
where I cook a lot more.
In the summer, I really
don't cook as much,
but I have really missed
eating one cinnamon roll a day,
or two cinnamon rolls a day.
So I am getting ready to pour my yeast
into my flour,
- I'm playing with Play Doh.
-  and you mister, you are,
you're playing with Play Doh.
So I'm making some
cinnamon rolls today guys.
So fun.
It's fall, it feels beautiful.
I can't wait to take Penny on a walk,
a family walk later.
- I want to go on a walk too.
-  You do, you
don't want to stay here?
- No.
- Well fine, okay well
we will all go on a walk.
But I gotta get this ready, look at that.
You know you're gonna have
some good cinnamon rolls,
when it looks like that.
While my bread is rising,
I want to do a little story time.
When I went into the
kitchen store the other day,
I was getting my friend a wedding present
and I ran into Bonnie and she was there.
And that always makes me laugh when we run
into each other, because
I think people think
that we've never seen each other,
because we're like oh my gosh,
so that was kind of funny.
But I was picking up a hand mixer
because a few times ago,
while I was cooking,
my mixers had broke.
So I picked up a new one
and when I was there, I
wanted the KitchenAid one,
because that's what I've always had,
and I didn't know how
good a brand this was
and Bonnie said that she has the same one,
and she loves it, and when I opened it,
it had kneaders for bread.
And so I've used those
and I really liked it.
And I was like this is awesome.
And then a few days later,
when I was in my pantry
making toast, I told you guys
how cool my toaster is,
it just is really cool,
like you put the toast in
and it slowly goes down
and it just seems like
a really cool toaster.
And it's the same brand,
then I just thought oh, I really like that
and so far, I really like these mixers,
so I think I scored by getting this.
But when we first moved into the house,
I bought like a big KitchenAid mixer,
and it had a shortage,
like it worked for one
time and it didn't work.
So when I went to take it back,
I ended up returning it and
not getting another one.
And I do like not having one,
I like that this is just small.
And I even have my kneading
mixers with that too, so,
kinda funny.
- I want to get braces.
-  You want to get braces?
- Yeah.
-  Show me how it works.
Oh, on your Play Doh,
show me how it works.
Cool.
You want to mix it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, hold this.
Hold this.
(mixer whirring)
Go all around.
Alright, three hours later and I am now
ready for the day.
And my bread has risen.
Doesn't it look awesome?
I tweeted you guys the other day
and I said, show me your spice cabinet,
because I was really interested
how everybody organized theirs.
Because something that
I've had a hard time
with since we've moved,
is trying to figure out how things work,
and I finally think I figured it out.
This is like the cookie
cutter and sprinkles,
because we don't really
get into that very much.
Pie plates and then a lot of
my kitchen stuff right here.
My spices used to be right here,
but it was really packed and stuff.
And a lot of you guys
had yours in drawers.
So I moved all my spices into the drawer
and I really liked it a lot better
so thanks for tweeting
me your guys' pictures
the other day.
But I am going to roll these out
and make some cinnamon rolls.
(chill guitar music)
That is a wrap.
I am done in the kitchen today.
When you're cooking bread in the kitchen,
it's all day in the kitchen,
you gotta wipe up the kitchen.
And entertain the kids.
They've watched some TV and they've played
outside a lot, so I think they're okay.
I think they're happy.
But bread is done,
cinnamon rolls are done.
I texted my mom and I said
when I make the cinnamon rolls,
I can't help but make them humongo.
I don't know how to not make them huge.
But I guess that's okay too, right?
Calvin is playing a trick on me.
Stop!
Every time I turn
okay, every time I turn it
on to rinse the sink out,
he pushes it to start
it and stop it again.
Jokes on you.
Can't turn it on.
Can't turn it on.
Stinker.
- Okay we need to spice
things up a little bit.
Alright?
Ellie has been in the kitchen all day,
making some delicious
cinnamon rolls and bread
and it's been amazing.
The kids have been playing,
having a great time,
but I think they need to spice things
up a little bit.
I've had something in my
trunk for quite some time
and I think it's about time I pull it out
and well, you'll see.
What the kids don't know,
oh they'll soon know.
So like I said, I've
had these in the trunk
for quite some time, just
waiting for the right moment
to pull them out,
and I think now's the perfect time.
Are you ready to see this?
Um, cue the epic entry moment.
(dramatic music)
It's time for a Nerf war.
The kids have no idea.
Ellie knows and I'm gonna call her up here
in just a second and have some help,
and we're gonna surprise the boys.
But it might not be a
surprise that you're thinking
that we're giving them.
It's the other kind of surprise.
And just in case we run out of ammo,
I've got plenty more.
(laughs)
Am I bad, or is this
just hilarious and fun?
We're about to find out, I don't know.
I'm excited, this is gonna be great.
Hey Ellie, can you come
upstairs and help me
for a minute?
(lively music)
Are you ready for this?
Hide it.
- Raaa!
Oh no.
They're so excited.
Oh no, fire.
It's not working.
-  It doesn't work!
-  What happened?
- Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry.
Let's get Daddy, let's get Daddy.
Waa, you did it!
Get him, get him, get him!
You won!
Good job.
- Na na na na na.
- Is that fun?
- Yeah.
- Here Calvin, here let me help ya.
- Oh that was funny.
My brother Beau had a yellow Nerf gun
and that thing lasted for years, years.
Okay let's see it.
(yelling)
Launch it back, launch
it back, hold it tight.
- Mission mission is a go, ready?
One two three.
(slow motion)
(laughing)
I hit the camera.
- You want to try it?
Whoa!
- Hoo Ha!
Ha!
-  No!
-  You're surrounded.
Grab your blaster, let's go.
Go go go!
Oh no.
- Your blaster, let me see it.
-  Blast Captain America's shield.
Nice.
Did you have fun with your blasters?
Okay, Daddy's gonna put 'em away, alright?
Can you say thanks Dad?
- Thanks Dad.
(Calvin singing)
- You're such a good musician.
You know that?
Seriously though, Calvin,
I think Calvin is gonna
have a musical talent.
Oh thanks for that blaster.
I think really Calvin is gonna have
a really great musical talent.
I forgot more blasters,
okay let's grab 'em.
Just between you and me guys,
these blasters are for me.
They're my toys.
The kids aren't even strong
enough to pull 'em back.
Besides I'm probably
going to be the only one
who's using it, mostly
to do things like this.
(Nerf shot)
- First a screech, then a growl
and a howl at the moon.
Next up zombie truck.
Headlights full of green dripping diesel.
He's cranky and green.
Then out of the shadows,
ghost truck appears.
- Truck.
Rattling his axles and grinding his gears.
- More trucks.
- More trucks.
- Are those more trucks?
- Vampire truck is toothsome cruel.
He waits for his victims
and drinks down their fuel.
Do you know who gave us this book?
- Yeah.
- All of our IVF couples last year,
they all chipped in and
bought us some stuff.
And that was so nice of them to give,
that's like a fun book.
That's the first time I've read it.
- Oh it's like my favorite book
to read to the kids, I love it.
It's fun because it's Halloween.
And Calvin loves trucks.
So I didn't tell you this,
so I went to the four-wheeler store today,
because we've got a fun
trip coming up this weekend
and I took Calvin with me.
We went into the store and he went crazy.
He went crazy, he was
like vroom vroom, vroom,
vroom vroom, truck.
It was the funniest thing,
like literally that
cadence, he saw every truck.
Do you remember
going to the trucks?
- When they're old enough,
- they will for sure
ride four-wheelers, huh?
-  Oh, you think
you're gonna sleep here again?
That didn't last very long last night.
-  No it didn't,
that was the worst.
-  Don't get comfy,
you're going into your own bed young man.
You're going into your own bed young man.
-  Hey Calvin, do
you sleep in your bed?
Calvin, do you sleep in your bed?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, you sleep in your bed.
Who's is this bed?
Who's bed?
- Bed.
- Jackson's.
My bed.
-  This is not your
bed, yours is upstairs.
- Mom look, the witch.
- No.
- Witch witch, I want to do this one.
- Okay last one and then it's bed time.
- The kids are in bed,
I just sent Ellie a text message.
And I'm gonna see if she has read it.
- Calvin's coughing.
- Oh we should be quiet.
- He just said let's meet
in the kitchen and make out.
-  You're here.
- And I feel like I'm in
a good mood right now,
not to make out.
Okay, I'll make out with you before I go.
Someone tweeted me to ask
if I would do the recipe
of my stuffed bell pepper
from last year that I showed.
It's really easy and simple
and I'm gonna film that tonight.
And then soon, I'm gonna film the one
that I made on Sunday, the quinoa one,
which is phenomenal.
So I gotta go, bye.
- You have to make out with me first,
before you go to the grocery store, okay?
Oh you want me to end it?
Alright guys that is
the vlog from us to you.
After the kids went to bed,
I made these for my channel.
We have a recipe down below
for the rolls and cinnamon rolls.
And then tomorrow you can
go to my channel for this.
I've had a good day in the kitchen.
I feel like it's just taken my mind,
just I haven't even thought.
I've just cooked and then
I've catered to the kids,
it's just been a really restful day,
even though I've been
in the kitchen working,
if that makes sense, just mentally.
I've really enjoyed it.
And tomorrow I can't wait to stuff my face
with cinnamon rolls,
so that's a plus, so.
Thank you so much Kaytlynn,
especially for watching the vlog today,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
And Penny's right here waiting for me
to give her food.
-  You are such a good girl Penny.
She is, like look at
her, with all this food
on these tables, she is just sitting there
like a good doggo.
- You know when my mom
and dad got our dog,
when she was seven months old, I think,
or she was probably a year old,
my mom made loaves of bread.
They had left somewhere,
and the dog had gotten up and eaten
all of the loaves of bread
and then crapped all over the house.
(laughs)
- It wouldn't be an Ellie
and Jared vlog without poop.
- See ya.
- Bye.
