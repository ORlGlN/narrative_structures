- Happy Valentine's Day.
(upbeat music)
- Jackson, what did you wish for?
- For you and Mommy to be happy.
(laughter)
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- You know the way to my heart.
Two years ago, my little Valentine
Day boys were right there
and this momma just made
the realization that this is
the last Valentine's Day that
is just Jackson and Calvin.
And then next year, we'll
have little brother.
You doin' okay, Cal?
Had a little rough morning?
You guys are twinners today again,
like you were two years ago.
(light happy music)
- Happy Valentine's Day.
-  What are you waiting for?
- My Valentine's card.
Daddy's getting my Valentine's card.
- Yes! Grandma. She just got back
Her and grandpa just got back from a trip,
and they brought you a Valentine card.
He's been waiting all morning to open it.
- I wanna open it.
-  Happy Valentine's Day!
Did you know that this is from Grandma?
Look at this. There's two.
One says Jackson,
and the other says Calvin.
This one's for you.
This is a giant Valentine's Day card.
And this one's for you.
And then, Elly, here's ours.
-  I love it! She
did not have to do that.
- She did not have to do
that at all, it's so sweet.
-  Thank you. Do you
wanna open it, Jackson?
Turn it around. Perfect.
-  What! That is the biggest card.
-  Oh my gosh, ha ha ha.
- My dog!
-  Wow.
- Is that the biggest
card you've ever seen?
-  Calvin, that
card is as big as you are.
-  That's so big.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  That was so nice of her.
-  That is so
sweet. Should we put these
in your piggy bank?
-  Let's see 'em.
Say thanks, Grandma!
- Thanks, Grandma. Happy Valentine's Day.
- Today is Valentine's
Day and that also means
it's my sister, Jennifer's, birthday
so happy birthday, Jennifer.
I hope you're feeling well,
especially with your pregnancy
and your two little boys,
and we can't wait to see you soon.
- But, not just Jennifer's birthday.
It's Valentine's Day.
And here's the thing.
I have a confession to
make. We told each other
that we weren't going to be
doing anything for each other,
but I did. I did.
- But we got each other the
coolest vacuum in the world.
That was our valentine.
- And that's not all.
Why don't you come with me, Elly?
- Okay.
- I've got something for you,
and as we walk over this way,
I want you to know that I
love you very, very much.
And as much as we, we get to
spend so much time together,
which is so wonderful,
and it's a huge blessing,
and I'm so grateful for that,
but there are some times
where I can't be there for
you, and it hurts my soul,
down in the depths of my
body. So I got you something
that would hopefully help with
that. K? You ready for this?
Close your eyes.
Okay. Happy Valentine's Day. You can look!
- I love it.
-  Do you?
- Thank you.
-  You're so welcome.
Did you see it? Be honest. Did you see it?
- Being 1,000 per cent honest,
of course. I make the bed
every day. You put it right by the bed!
- I put it by the bed. I'm a little dumb,
but here's the thing, Elly,
you go through every square
inch of this house,
where am I gonna hide it?
- No, I don't. I make the
bed everyday. Thank you.
-  Either way,
Happy Valentine's Day.
- Thank you. It is a massager for my neck.
I'm not gonna lie. We got
Jared's mom one for Christmas.
And I was borderline, like...
-  Why didn't you get me one?
- My head hurts all the time! I want one.
So thank you, I really appreciate it.
-  You're welcome. I love you.
- Do you wanna try it?
-  So, when you're
watching The Bachelor,
you can put that thing on and be like,
oh yeah, Jared, you're
doing a really great job.
- Let's show Jackson the demonstration.
You put it on your neck
and you have that to hold.
- I want it to turn on.
- We'll turn it on and it rubs your neck,
and it rubs your back
and it rubs your booty.
- Gosh, I was just counting
down the minutes until our kids
fell asleep. Jackson and
Calvin are both asleep finally.
Now,
hey Siri,
play me some love jams.
-  Eww.
(laughter)
-  What about the Greatest Showman?
- Um, yeah.
-  That sparks some love.
- That definitely does.
And motivation and every good
feeling in your whole body.
-  Elly, from the
moment that I laid eyes on you,
for the very first time,
I knew there was something
special about you,
and that we would have some
sort of future together.
I didn't know exactly what it was,
but I knew there was something special.
And, of course, when I
was younger and dating,
I saw girls, and I thought
they were attractive
and everything, but you,
there was something different about you.
When we were at Landon's homecoming,
and you leaned over, and our
eyes met, my heart jolted.
-  It really was
love at first sight.
-  Absolutely. I knew
there was something special about you,
and I had to find out what it was.
And I am so grateful from the
bottom of my freaking heart
that we met, that we fell in
love and that we have these
two, and a half, one on the way,
boys that we made,
that our love made,
and that we get to see them grow
right before our very eyes.
- We were talking in the
car, and it was like,
it really was love at first
sight, but it wasn't like
from then on we just
continued to date, and it was
just Jared and I. It was
like, we kept thinking,
we had each other in our
minds and in our hearts
as we went our separate
ways, and we came back
to each other, and it has
been easy to love you.
Our life has been easy
together. We have made
every situation just
happy and smooth and fun.
We've been together for
10 years! I've loved it.
We've had some rocky
times, and it's not been
peaches 'n cream the
whole time, but I would
really say our life has
been smooth, and our love
has been easy, and it's
been easy to communicate,
and easy to forgive, and
it's just easy to love you.
- Thank you. It's easy
to love you, and I think
we've always said communication
is just so important,
and that's what we do is
we talk to each other.
- We talk almost too much,
but it's perfect for us.
- Absolutely. It just blows
my mind how grateful I am
to be here with you right
now, to be where we are,
to have our kids, to have
one on the way, to go through
the ups and the downs with
you. I love that I have you
every day,
now and forever,
throughout all eternity.
-  My little Jackselina.
-  Jackson, you
look like Princess Peach!
-  You two twirl!
Let's see you twirl.
(laughter)
- I'm building a racing car.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, Jackson, here's a secret.
You put most of your weight
in the front of the car,
and that way, as it goes down,
it has a faster acceleration.
Mark Rover taught me that
at the Pinewood Derby.
-  All right, all
three of the cars are made.
Let's see who wins.
Was this yours?
Daddy won!
(upbeat music)
- I got the two biggest
bath bombs I've ever seen,
and I can't wait to use
them in our big bathtub.
(upbeat music)
-  What did he wish for?
- Jackson, what did you wish for?
- For you and Mommy to be happy.
- That is so sweet, thanks, Jackson.
What a selfless wish, that was so nice.
I love you, bud. Happy Valentine's Day.
You think that's a good wish?
Me too.
- That was cute.
- Yeah, it was.
- What! Did you do that?
-  Happy Valentine's Day!
- I love that!
-  You do?
- Look at the purple ones,
and the vases are cute.
You bought them for me?
- Yes...
- They're from all my boys.
-  They are. We each
picked out some roses for you.
When did you do that, yesterday?
- Yep, yesterday.
- And who delivered them?
-  It's a surprise, it's a ghost.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, but that's not all!
We've got one more sweet
surprise for our sweet mom.
- Shut up, stop Jared, we said we weren't.
- We said no, but this is something small.
Jackson, go give these to Mom, okay?
- You know the way to my
heart. Do you guys want
to eat one in the bathtub?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna open them.
-  Happy Valentine's Day,
and your boys love you too.
- Thank you.
Our day has been perfect,
and then this is so sweet.
Thank you.
-  You're welcome, I love you.
- The purple are my favorite,
who picked those out?
-  I think Jackson
picked out the pink ones,
Calvin picked out the purple ones,
and I got the red ones.
We'll go take a bath and
they can have the chocolate.
This morning Jackson told
me I looked like a witch
cause my lipstick was extra
dark and I just have been
telling them how cute they are to me,
and Jackson, what did you just say to Mom?
Do you remember?
- You're so beautiful as a witch.
- He goes, "you're so
beautiful as a witch."
(laughing)
- Well, at least he said I was beautiful.
Let's get ready to take a bath bomb bath.
(loud, upbeat music)
- I love your Valentine's Day gift, Jared!
- When Jackson made his
wish, it's like, okay,
there's no perfect way
to parent, half the time,
no one really knows what
they're doing anyway.
We're all just trying our
best and when Jackson thought
about his mom and dad's
happiness, a little four year old,
that says a lot, and I
don't necessarily think
that's because we're good
parents, but I think it's because
he truly sees the connection that we have.
Like he knows that I am your everything,
and he knows that you are my everything.
He sees his grandparents'
love, he sees his other
grandparents' love, he
sees his aunts' and uncles'
love. I just feel like
family is very special,
and the relationships
that we make are crucial.
I feel like it's not
because of a good parenting
moment that we've taught
him, it's just because
of what he has seen and what he has felt.
- Absolutely. We are not
having a difficult time
with each other right now. We're happy,
and he sees that we're
happy, yet he wishes
for more happiness.
I think that just goes to
show the maturity of Jackson,
a four year old.
- It almost makes me sad.
I'm like, just be four!
Wish for a damn dinosaur!
(laughter)
It is sweet and I hope
that we always remember
that his heart is tender
and I hope we can always
parent well around that.
- Absolutely. Valentine's
Day is very special,
and I love it. I love that
there's a day set apart
for us to celebrate love
between us, between friends
and family and all around the world.
I'm just glad I get to spend it with you.
- Thanks, you too.
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- We have some strawberries
that are covered
in chocolate that we're
going to partake...
- That I've one ham on.
- You deserve it, treat yourself.
That's been the theme of the day.
Treat yourself, girl.
Treat yourself, 2011.
I think that's where we're
gonna end the vlog today.
We are going to continue
celebrating our love.
- Why are you laughing?
- Just because...
- Was that a joke?
- No.
- We're gonna start a fire...
- We're gonna start a fire
- We're gonna start a burning fire.
- In our fire pit outside.
- I think we're gonna
have a fire, I think we're
gonna get in the hot tub, and we are going
to enjoy our night. Thank you
guys so much for watching.
I meant everything I said,
I love you, and I love
that we can joke together.
I love that we can call
each other dummies,
and I just love you,
you're my best friend.
Thank you guys for watching, and I hope
that you guys had a special day,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- No seriously, why were you laughing?
