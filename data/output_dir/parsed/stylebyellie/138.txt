- First of all, Jared and I are coming up
on eight years of marriage.
- Woo.
- And I don't know why that's relevant.
I just think that we
should throw that in there.
I think it's cute,
and that this is so long ago.
So my sister Julie just did a video
where she tried on her old prom dress.
So I have some old prom dresses here
and then even two special ones
that I'll try on at the end.
- Bonus.
- Let's go on with the very
first dress I ever wore,
it was to a homecoming.
And it, to this day, is my favorite dress.
- This
- I'll try it on
- while you talk.
- Okay, so the dress that Ellie's going
to start out with,
is the very first picture I saw of Ellie.
I can't remember if it was on my mission
with Landon and he had
pictures of your family.
I think that's where it was.
But I saw the picture of
Ellie and I was just like wow,
she is beautiful.
And she was wearing this dress.
And so it's like ingrained in my mind
because it was the very first picture
I saw of Ellie,
so it's just a really
really beautiful dress.
-  Close your eyes.
Woo.
- Tell me when I can open them.
-  Here, you hold
up the picture to them.
- So this is the picture of Ellie at prom,
or one of the dances, homecoming.
And then this is her
wearing the dress again.
- Laaaa.
- It looks really good Ellie.
- Thanks.
And it's been cleaned and
put away in closets forever.
- Yeah.
- And I think on our cruise,
I should've brought it on our cruise,
so I could've worn it.
- Yeah that would've been really fun.
- Yeah, it's really cute.
- I think it looks better on you now.
- I think for the day I had
it pinned just a little.
- Yeah, no yeah, I can
see that in the picture.
- Yeah.
Aww, there it is.
- Look how good you look.
- I love the sparkles on the bottom.
- Okay, next dress.
Really I'm just here to go down
memory lane with you Ellie.
I don't really have any part of this.
Do you need me to zip you up on this one.
- Yes.
(laughs)
Did this really fit me then?
(laughing)
This is awkward.
So I wore this dress twice.
You can show them.
- There's that one time.
And then there's that time.
- And we actually came up to here,
to this town to buy this dress.
- Oh wow.
- With Mom.
With Mom and Bonnie.
Cute.
- Yeah.
- And I love the pick ups in it.
And this pretty much looked
just like my wedding dress, but white.
- Yep.
- And I just rented my wedding dress,
I don't have it.
Isn't that cute?
- Yeah I like it.
- It was a really
different color of green.
This was two years apart,
so you can see one picture
I had really short bangs,
and then the other picture
was the year before we got married.
Oh this was my senior year,
so then we got married--
- Right after that
- We were dating, so the story about this,
Jared and I were actually dating
when I went to my prom.
And he felt and I felt,
like it was very mutual,
like you need to go to your prom,
you need to like be in high
school and do your thing
and then when you're done,
we'll really be serious and date.
But what did you think?
- I was in love with you.
- Well tell me, like what did you think
- When you went to prom?
- When I went to prom, yeah.
- Well I didn't think much of it,
because I knew you were just
gonna call me right afterwards,
and we were gonna talk, so.
I thought it was important
that you went to your senior prom,
so of course you went.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- There we go.
- You look good.
- Thanks.
- You look like a little lime.
- This next one,
is a real doozy.
- Ooh.
- Okay, I have to preference this dress.
We're both cringing.
Okay, this was Bonnie's dress
and I wore it to two dances.
Bonnie is very large chested,
so how come I tried to fit into this,
I don't know what my parents were,
I guess, just sweet enough to just think
oh she feels good in it, let her wear it.
So when Bonnie wore this dress,
it just came like this.
But my Mom said, I think
you should put something
on the sleeves, so it's, you know,
a little more modest.
These are like the wimpiest,
see-throughest, ugliest
sleeves in the world.
And I think
- But good for your mom to do that, right?
- Yes, I just don't think
it's flattering at all.
And now I can fill it in a little better.
But at the time,
I was like, trying to do this
and hold it with my chest,
so it didn't like fall down.
You know, it's like oh brother,
you can show them the pictures.
- And you wore it two different times.
-  Yes, to different proms.
- Ellie, you went to a lot of dances.
(laughs)
Okay do a spin.
- Okay, here we go.
It's not my favorite.
It's kind of funny that it was Bonnie's
and then everyone tried to wear it.
And that's what it was.
- So the dress that
Ellie's gonna put on now
has some pretty special meaning to me
along with the first dress.
They're kind of firsts.
The first dress was when I first saw Ellie
and this dress I think
is when we both knew
that we were in love with each other.
-  Totally.
- So come on out, show 'em.
- Ahhhh.
- Woooo.
(laughs)
- This dress was when my
sister Julie got married.
And I'm surprised and
shocked that it still fits.
It was during the holiday season,
so it's red and sparkly
and really fun for a party.
And I wore some sort
of black shawl with it.
- But this dress she wore
to her sister's wedding.
And that was the time
that Ellie and I, we were
dating some other people
off and on, but that was
like when we were like,
no,
- I really like you.
- We're gonna date each other.
- And it just happened.
- Yeah.
- We left there just being like,
we love each other.
And it was not like anything crazy,
we just were with each other, we hung out,
and we didn't want to
not be with each other.
- And then 11 months
later, we got married.
(gasps)
- Isn't that weird?
11 months before I was married.
Woo, kay.
- And we're in love still.
(laughs)
We're still in love.
Whoa, baby.
(laughs)
Woo!
- Next up, my mom's prom dress.
- Ooh is this one of the bonus ones?
- Yes.
- Oh fun.
Okay, we're having a flashback.
- This
- It's very
- is my mom's prom dress.
- Come a little closer.
- And it has been hanging up
in our closets for years.
And my mom was so sweet.
When I told her I was doing this,
she said, you should try on my prom dress.
I was like, okay and I want
to be very careful with it.
My mom's mom made this
for my mom for her prom.
Like look at the detail
- of this.
- It's very elegant.
- She made this shawl to go with it.
Isn't that beautiful?
- It's pretty, yeah, it's very pretty.
- Like every stitching on it,
I'm just like, my grandma did that
and it looks so nice.
- You have to think about it this way,
like how late did she stay up
sowing this for your mom?
- Yeah and my grandma had
cancer all while my mom
was growing up, she was very sick,
so I think just knowing that
and knowing she made this is so
- So special.
- Special, yeah.
- It's beautiful, the color's beautiful.
the white and orange.
If I was smart, I probably
should've worn this
to one of my proms.
How cute would that have been?
But how cute, huh?
- Yeah, it looks really great.
- I love it.
Thanks Mom, for letting me try it on.
So those are some special
dresses that I have worn.
It's funny that we have these
and I don't have my wedding dress,
but we didn't buy our wedding dress.
- It just wasn't that
important, our wedding.
(laughing)
- Well I think it was
just cheaper to rent.
- Yeah.
- And I don't regret it, I rented it.
I think the only one who
bought it was Bonnie,
bought her dress and it
was beautiful as well,
and I have a picture of it
and that's awesome.
- My sister Melanie
bought her wedding dress.
I don't think she wished she did.
I think she wished she would've rented it.
I'll have to ask her.
But this was fun for me to be a part of,
I'm sorry if I kinda was
just like a fly on the wall
and just like hey,
- It was cute.
- look at this memory lane prom dress
try on session.
- Let me ask you one question,
is there one thing
about any of your dances
that stick out.
- I mean I think senior
prom was the most fun
that I had, because our
closest group of friends
that we all went together with,
that was a ton of fun.
And they had it at this really cool place,
so it wasn't at the school.
- That was fun.
- So I think that was fun.
- I had another winter
formal that I went to
while I was in Washington,
that I was invited to in Utah
but it wasn't with you,
it was before I even knew you.
So I flew to Utah for a
- Which boggles my mind.
It's cute, it's cute that
your parents let you.
I don't know if my parents
would ever let me do that.
- I don't know.
Not too many years people
as cool as me go to proms
outside of their own state, right?
- That's cool, that's fun.
- That's kinda like weird
for me to say, I'm sorry.
But those are just things
that I have memories of, so.
- How fun.
- Yeah.
What was your coolest
and worst memory of prom?
- I don't think I have a worst memory.
I think they were all really fun.
I think that everyone I was with
was always just very
nice and fun to be with
and I always had fun.
You know, for a few of the dances,
like you do an activity before
and we would go shooting.
So for a lot, like we'd go
shotgun shooting, like pigeons,
you know, like laser tag,
we would do stuff like that.
- Okay, here's one thing I remember.
You hated going bowling before,
for your activity.
I remember you calling me on the phone
and talking about, like you have this date
coming up, like this prom date,
and you're going bowling
for your date activity
and you're just like, I
don't want to go bowling
for my date activity,
which is funny, because
I enjoy bowling so much.
- I don't remember that at all,
that's funny.
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's funny, huh.
Oh my gosh, it's fun to
go back down memory lane
and think about the things
that you were thinking
and the things you said,
and just how they compare to now.
Because we would go
bowling in a heartbeat.
- Yeah.
- And we would have fun.
- I was a dork.
- You still kinda are.
It's alright, I love you.
- You dork.
- That's funny.
- Well that is the prom dresses
that I have tried on.
I hope you enjoyed this video.
This was fun to do, love you.
- Love you.
- That green one was kind of funny.
I think it was hilarious
that it was Bonnie's.
Bonnie had a completely
different body type
than any of us, and
all of us sisters tried
to wear it because at the time it was like
beautiful.
- This is nice.
- This is a sweet dress.
- Okay, we'll see you guys later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
