- World's biggest bath bomb.
(bright music)
- I see my doggie's head!
(Ellie laughs)
- My worries and fears have actually
gotten maybe a little worse.
I was like, what were you thinking?
Ah!
- Oh bud.
Good morning guys, it's not 20 minutes
before the next day
and we already have more controversy.
- Why did you put a Band-Aid in your hair?
- I have an owie.
- You have an owie?
- Why'd you do it?
- I don't know.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- He got an owie on his head
and he put a Band-Aid on it.
- Look at this, look
at him, he's flinching.
I'm trying to be really soft.
- {Jared] I think you should just
pull it off like a Band-Aid.
- Ah!
-  Oh bud.
- Calvin, don't--
- Ow.
- I know.
-  Band-Aids are
supposed to help, not hurt.
- I've never dealt with Band-Aids in hair.
- Get the peanut butter,
actually that'll probably work.
- That's what we'll do.
Calvin, don't do that, come here.
-  Let's get your hair wet.
That'll make it come off a lot easier.
- Look at that.
Like if I were to try,
he's like no no no no no.
(Calvin cries)
We'll just get it wet.
-  Yeah, get it wet, get it wet.
You guys need a bath
anyway, you're stinky.
You got some stinky bums.
After camping trip,
the best thing in the whole
entire world is showering,
taking a bath when you're all done,
getting all of that gunk and grease
and goodness off of you.
- Ow!
Ow, ow!
- Does it hurt?
- No.
- Ow!
- I don't think it does.
- Yeah it does.
- It does a little?
- You have my thumb.
- Your thumb?
Oh don't you bite me, you little turd.
What happens if you bite me?
- No I'm licking you.
- Oh, 'cause I would bite you right back.
And then you would cry.
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Well Ellie,
then you would have him
turn into a vampire.
I'm not sure if you guys know
this, but Ellie's a vampire
and if she bites Jackson,
Jackson will turn into a vampire too.
I know we've shown Ellie
in front of mirrors before,
but we have set that
up with camera trickery
and duplicated layers and everything
throughout all the vlogs.
That's why editing takes so long.
And the daylight is actually
just natural blue light.
Everything that we film actually
is actually at nighttime
but this light out here that you see
is a natural daylight bulb
that is shining on the
outside of our house.
It's a long process that
we have to go through.
We've never mentioned
it before in the vlogs,
but I just thought we'd finally say it.
Ellie, she's a vampire.
(scary music)
- Alright guys look at this.
Jackson, pregnancy with him at 25 weeks,
Calvin 25 weeks.
I guess I should be wearing a black shirt,
which I am.
And baby, at 25 weeks.
- Do you need a little scarf?
- Look at that.
-  Yeah.
- I look so different each pregnancy,
I'm just like is that even me?
Okay let's take a picture,
then I'll have all three side-by-side.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Awww.
- Sorry.
(Ellie laughs)
- I love hugging you.
- I sometimes love this too.
- We literally today
after I got ready guys,
this morning we hugged and I was like oh,
it was awkward and then we hugged again
and it was awkward,
and then he's like here, let me--
- Here, let me concave.
- And I was like perfect fit.
- It's the puzzle piece.
- Alright guys, I've been
doing what I love the most,
which is quiet.
(laughs)
And organizing and just
being in my own element.
I don't know why, I would love
to go to people's homes and just clean.
I really enjoy just wiping up,
reorganizing stuff,
seeing a before and after,
that's stuff that's soothing to me.
And I know I've said this before,
but it's kinda like peoples' crafts.
I'm not as crafty of a person,
but I can see why people
would love crafts,
because that's their element,
that they can sit down and create.
And so anyway, that's
what I've been doing.
Look my mirror's still so dirty
with the kids playing with Play-Doh,
but I posted a picture on
Instagram of me being 25 weeks.
And then me being 25 weeks
with the other two babies,
so it's really fun to
see my belly side-by-side
and just how I've changed.
Looking back at those pictures how I felt
during those times versus how I feel now.
it's just really fun to look back on.
But I'm gonna show you
guys what I've been up to.
First I'm gonna start right here.
I found the perfect bench
that I want right here
that I'm gonna ask for
Mother's Day or something,
but it is so cute.
It's from Lulu and Georgia,
I found it a few weeks agao,
but it's a really cute fluffy bench
to go right here.
I've just been bringing
the benches from my room in
and it's not very fun
to always pick 'em up.
And bring it back and
I would like to have a bench here,
so that's on my list.
I have my little mirror
that I get ready with,
my grandma gave me this dish.
And this is my favorite perfume ever.
It's Michael Kors and it's super flowery,
which usually is not what I would like,
I used to really like sweet scents,
but lately I've been
liking the floral scents.
It's not Jared's way favorite,
but it's my favorite, I love it.
And of course, I put my
make-up in my new case.
This is what I used to have.
It was this smaller case
that I got from Muji,
that I would have my make-up in and on
and then I'd put my lipsticks on there
and then we got our sample products,
so I've been using that
and I officially just put it in my case.
So this was like 40
dollars that I paid for,
and this is our case.
You can tell it's a lot bigger.
But I have all my make-up in here,
my lipsticks, you can tell
the Nars is my favorite,
my make-up, everything and brushes.
So that is my getting ready section,
that I've officially
organized and cleaned.
And then I've gotten this drawer
and this is all my getting ready stuff,
my face washes, eye creams, my lotions.
I've talked before that
I've been a huge fan
of Shiseido and there
hasn't been another product
that I've been like yes,
I love these face washes
and creams as much,
until this last year.
And I really like the brand Skin.
I like their face masks a lot.
And then of course, I've talked about
I like Dermalogica a lot
and then I like Rodan + Fields,
so I kinda have a mix of both of those
that I really like.
So I have this all organized,
my getting ready products.
And then I like to do pedicures a ton,
so I actually have a drawer for pedicures.
I got his bad boy on Amazon.
It's a foot scrubber and it's amazing.
And I just have everything I need
for my own pedicures at home.
So just a foot softener,
lotions, cuticle remover.
So that's my little drawer for pedicures
and then down here under this cabinet,
I got this at Target.
I've loved having this.
It just holds all my curling iron stuff.
Bonnie and I are doing a
hair tutorial this week.
And a lot of people have been asking
what curling wand I use.
and I use the Nume wand.
This one's a tapered one,
but I do have a regular one as well.
But that's that
and then this was our
sample product that came
before we had our logo
and the buttons on it
and just to see how we like the structure.
So up top is all my combs that I have,
then I have my belly massage bar.
It's from Lush, this is called Therapy.
A lot of people asked
what I use, it's Therapy.
And then I just have all my nail stuff,
I love to do my nails,
I love to do my toenails,
so it's kinda like my own stuff at home.
That's my nail polishes.
And then just my hair
products getting ready.
So that is my bathroom, it is organized.
Next on to the main bathroom.
In our main bathroom,
we have a cupboard here
that's kinda crazy that
I'm gonna sit and organize
and I want to get a shelf
ready for when I have the baby,
like a heating pad and everything
that I'm gonna need for
when I deliver the baby.
So I need to organize this
and then I'm gonna feel really good today.
Then my list is done.
But Bonnie and I are doing a giveaway.
It is Mother's Day around the corner
and we are going to be giving away
two dresses, two robes, two workout gears
and two organizing cases,
so if you guys want to enter,
we're doing it right now.
So go over to our Instagram,
Bolliebrand, our Instagram.
We'll have everything in the description,
but we're doing a huge giveaway,
so if you guys want to
enter to win any of those,
go ahead and go do it.
In the meantime, I'm just gonna sit here
in my happy place and organize.
So Calvin just came in
to go to the bathroom
and he this morning has been such a pill.
Between the Band-Air in his hair,
I went downstairs today
and I was like, what were you thinking?
He literally peed inside
of Jackson's car garage toy downstairs.
And I was like, what are you doing?
Okay, flush the potty.
And I couldn't help,
I try not to laugh in frontt of the kids,
when they do something naughty,
but I couldn't help but laugh,
I was like, what were you thinking?
He's pointing, for his prize.
Calvin still gets a little prize
if he goes potty,
because i still feel it's pretty new
still with him going and it
still is keeping him excited,
and looking forward to
going to the bathroom,
so he still gets prizes when he goes.
Did you get one?
You got two?
Show me.
Whoa.
Your favorite color.
- Yeah.
-  Is your favorite color green?
- No.
-  What's your favorite color?
- Red, two red.
- Two reds.
I said that because I knew
it wasn't his favorite color.
I always kinda put green on Calvin,
but he actually really loves red.
Alright, that finally
looks a little better.
The kids have a shelf, I have a shelf.
I got these at Target when we moved in.
I thought it looked so cute
and matched in here.
What's up?
You need underwear on.
Did Dad tell you to come some?
I organized this, this is Calvin,
there's some pull-ups, some underwear.
He's really picky.
He likes the Roar ones.
Can you find one?
-  No.
-  You can't?
You gotta choose.
-  This.
-  Oh the last one.
Okay, put 'em on.
Back to this, then I have
my section, Jared and I's,
and then just down there
is our heating pad,
some pads and that is it.
That is our close in there,
so my bathroom and this
bathroom, check, done.
I'm seriously grabbing
things from around the house
and just putting them away.
And I'm putting the MiraLAX
(laughs)
next to the pads,
for in three months, when I need all that.
I would think that after
Jackson and Calvin,
I wouldn't be nervous delivering
and having another baby,
but I actually feel like
my worries and fears
have actually gotten maybe a little worse,
because I know what happens
and I know how you recover.
I don't know, maybe for
some it's not that way,
but for me, it totally is.
I'm not really nervous to give birth,
but I'm really nervous for the after care,
because the pains that you have
when you're recovering are a
lot stronger after each baby
or at that's the way it's
been with me and my family.
And just having to go to the bathroom
for the first few times
after delivering a baby
has always terrified me
and I'm really nervous for that.
(laughs)
I'm not looking forward to that.
But I'm looking forward
to everything else.
I'm looking forward to
kissing my sweet baby, huh?
We gotta officially name you.
I think we're pretty close.
- We are just having a
little snack as a family.
- Apples and caramel.
- Apples and caramel.
And I thought this would be a fun time
to talk to Jackson about something.
On our trip to Vegas,
we saw lots of what in the sky?
- Clouds.
- Clouds, yes, we saw lots of clouds.
And there was rain and there
was all kinds of clouds
and everything and I wanted to teach you--
- And thunder.
- And thunder, that's right.
And I remember as a kid
we would make clouds in bottles
and I wanted to teach you
how we can make a cloud
inside of this bottle.
You thought the clouds were so cool,
so I thought, let's
make one at home, okay?
And I'm gonna show you
guys how to do it too,
it's really simple.
All you need is a bottle, a match
and some hot water.
So I'm gonna go put some hot water
just in the very bottom of this.
- Okay.
- And then we'll light the match
and I'll show you exactly
what we're doing, okay?
Now I'm gonna teach
you how to make a cloud
inside of a bottle.
- It's not serious.
-  It's not serious?
- Yeah.
-  You don't think
there's gonna be a cloud in here?
- No.
-  Oh!
- You don't think there's gonna be a cloud
inside this bottle?
- I think--
- Okay, challenge accepted.
What do I get,
if I can make a cloud
inside of this bottle?
- Using hot water.
- Using hot water, yeah.
What will you give me,
if I can make the cloud in this bottle?
- A match.
- A match, okay, challenge accepted.
(bright music)
So we've got this water in here.
So what I'm gonna do,
is just blow a little bit.
And increase the pressure in there, okay?
So now I've got water in here.
There's a little pressure in here
and we're just gonna shake it up.
(sloshing)
Make sure the cap is on (laughs).
Shake it up, do you want to shake it up?
I'll trade ya.
Now it's a little hot,
so just be careful, okay?
(sloshing)
Real good, shake it hard.
Shake it like you've never
shaked before, my son.
There ya go.
So now what we're going to do
is we're going to light this match
and we're going to have
it go inside of here
but in a very special way,
so watch closely, okay?
I'm gonna light this match.
So I've got this match.
And what I'm gonna do
open it up and let the smoke go in there.
We have the smoke inside of here
and the water inside of here.
Now what I'm gonna do is squeeze this
and that's gonna increase the pressure.
And when you increase the pressure,
that increases the temperature,
so it gets a little warmer in here.
And then when you let go,
it lowers the temperature
and that's when the cloud will form.
So go ahead and squeeze it.
(crunching plastic)
Squeeze, do you see how it's clear?
Let it go.
Now if you look right
here, do you see that?
Squeeze, let go.
You see the cloud in there?
- Uh-huh.
- Open this up,
the cloud will come out.
You see right here?
Do you see that?
- Woo, poof.
- Is that cool?
Do you see the cloud?
Boop, boop boo.
- Can I try?
- Okay do it.
(crunching plastic)
(Jared laughs)
-  Ah, it's coming out.
- You're making the cloud in our house.
- Is that cool?
When it was raining and
storming on the way home,
Jackson was seriously
like, where's the sky?
Why is it raining?
- Why isn't the sky blue?
- It was such a long drive
and he was just staring
outside for so long.
- His brain was just going
through all of these questions,
why does the rain fall?
Why is the sky blue?
Why isn't the sky blue right now.
Why are there so many clouds?
- Rain, the rain.
- Oh you wanna see it?
- You wanna see rain?
- Okay, so look there.
(crunching plastic)
Can you see the cloud?
It's clear,
mix the temperature and pressure.
(Ellie laughs)
I guess I'm not good enough.
-  He was done.
- Anyway, Jackson had
all of these questions
and I thought, we can learn
about all of this stuff
and we can use these
bottles to teach them,
because it's really easy
to do that kinda stuff, so.
I thought this would be
a fun experiment to do.
Was that cool bud?
Good, I'm glad you liked it.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome buddy,
did you learn something?
- Yeah.
- Oh good.
-  Calvin, come help me.
Give your doggie a kiss.
And say it's time to clean you.
- It's time to clean you.
-  Okay, put him in the washer.
- No!
-  Calvin, Calvin.
- No!
(laughs)
-  Hey look look, kiss your doggie.
Give your doggie a hug.
He's so dirty, we gotta wash him.
- No!
- You know how you take
baths when you're dirty?
Do you take baths?
- No!
- Your doggie needs a bath.
-  You know how
your doggie poo pooed?
Look.
You know on the trip, the
doggy ate lots of food
and he poo pooed.
- Your doggie needs a bath, I'm sorry bud.
We have to give your doggie a bath.
-  Hurry.
- Just like you get a bath.
-  Do you want to put him in?
Okay come on.
- Yeah okay go, go put him in.
-  Hurry hurry,
we'll give him a bath.
It's gonna spin.
Should we watch him?
Yeah.
Okay, now this one.
Good job.
This little dog has been
around for two years
and we've never really washed washed him
and it's disgusting.
(laughs)
Okay, should we watch him?
Okay we'll watch him get clean, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
His eyes are down.
- His eyes are gonna be closed?
- Yeah.
- We'll watch him spin.
Okay.
- Spin.
- Spin.
Okay, he'll get nice and clean
and then you can have him tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I saw my doggie's head!
(laughs)
- Did you see his head?
- Yeah.
- He was sitting right up.
Okay, so he has another stuffed animal
that he carries around
and I just will spot clean it.
I don't know if it's a bad idea
that I'm putting this
in the washing machine,
but I feel like it just needs it,
and if it ruins it, we
might just have to find it.
Is he in there?
- Yeah.
- So funny.
- Why is he in there?
- His doggie's in there to get washed.
Can you believe that it is six o'clock?
The day has flown by.
We've been cleaning and organizing all day
from getting home from our trip.
And Calvin put a Band-Aid
on his puppy dog.
-  Awww, make sure he's okay.
- Yeah cute, huh, he put a
Band-Aid on his puppy dog..
- That's sweet.
- We're gonna go ahead and say goodbye,
get these kids wrapped up.
And we're gonna try and have
a little in-home date night.
Will you hold him?
- Absolutely I'll hold him.
- I was gonna chuck him across the room.
- Now one question I had,
so I just did that experiment with Jackson
with that bottle.
Let me know if there's
any other experiments
that you would like us to do
in the comments down below.
I think this would be fun for me
to do with the boys,
something like father-son bonding,
but also educational.
I would love to hear
your thoughts on that.
So, that's gonna be it
from us, thank you guys.
- More bath bomb videos for Mom.
- Yes, bath bomb.
Worlds biggest bath bomb.
Okay, we'll see you guys next time.
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.
- Bye sticky.
