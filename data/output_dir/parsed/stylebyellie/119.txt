(gentle music)
- And they basically confirmed
that Ellie would be miscarrying.
- I just have been pretty sad.
(gentle music)
- I'm not sure what the
future has in store for us,
but I just got hit with the fact that
this might be it,
and that's not a bad thing at all.
But it was hard for me to hear that voice
say that to me,
that's what I wanted to
tell you a little bit.
(gentle music)
You okay?
-  I don't know.
I don't know how I feel.
- Are you kidding me right now?
-  I just called Julie,
- Ellie?
-  Asking if
it's possible to have--
I know.
- Did you just take this?
- Yes.
(laughing)
- Oh my gosh.
Ellie this is amazing, like what?
I think the strangest
thing about this is that
we struggled with infertility,
we could not get a
positive pregnancy test.
We couldn't get one.
And we've had three in such
a short amount of time.
This is like--
- But two miscarriages.
- Yeah, it's so exciting,
it's just like the timing is just crazy.
- Oh my gosh.
(gentle music)
(laughs)
Oh my gosh.
- Hey I love you so much.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- This is exciting.
- This is exciting.
- Jinx, you owe me a soda.
- It's just scary.
- It's just scary.
- Yeah.
-  Well given the circumstances,
given where we have been and where we were
- You gotta be kidding me.
-  and where we are now.
Like this close to a D&C,
that's what worries me.
- Well I'm gonna very hopeful.
But I don't want to do that again.
- I know exactly what you mean.
- That's what I said to
him over and over and over.
I said I cannot mentally,
physically do that again.
Like I just don't even know
how I would cope this time.
Like I can't.
I don't know how people do it.
- I think like being
there was hard enough,
let alone going through it.
- Yeah.
I told Julie, I was like,
maybe we'll get an ultrasound
between now and Thanksgiving
and announce it at Thanksgiving.
-  Oh that would be fun.
- Yay, we officially
have known for two weeks
and the excitement is hitting now.
Of course, we've been excited,
but we've been extremely weary
with our last two pregnancies ending
in miscarriage back to back.
And I got my blood work done
and my levels look great,
and a big thing that we and the doctors
have been worried about,
is my progesterone.
The last time, my
progesterone was at a 10,
and that's very low, and so
they had me on progesterone
to get my levels up.
And the nurse just called me
and was very excited and
said that my progesterone
has never been this high.
With me being in the office with Calvin
and the last two pregnancies,
she says my levels are at a 30.
And she said I don't
even need progesterone.
And I am thrilled, I am excited.
I'm very very excited.
I've been really trying to rest a lot.
We've been laying in bed, watching shows.
I've been trying to eat
lots, keep hydrated,
so that is it where we are now.
So I am currently five weeks along
and we already gave you an update
of how I have been feeling.
I haven't felt any different,
other than a little bit
of physical changes,
like a little fullness.
- Yeah.
- But we've been a week in China
and no smells have bugged me,
no food has upset me--
- Which there have been very strong smells
that Ellie's not used to,
and so that kind of surprises me
that you're not feeling
a lot of that stuff.
- It's different,
I mean we're in a different country,
so of course the smell is different,
but as far as like lots of
cigarette smoke and stuff.
But today is the fist
day where I have felt
very nauseous all day
and it's not anything other than
I totally know that I
just don't feel well.
And I know it's that.
- Yeah.
- And so, in a week, when
we get back in one week,
I have a doctor's appointment
with an ultra sound
for an early ultra-sound,
to make sure everything's okay.
- Woo.
- So I'm nervous and I'm excited,
but today I'm grateful
that I am not feeling well,
because I feel like that gives us--
- I remember thinking back,
just waiting for any sign
that you don't feel good
- Yeah.
- And how grateful you were for that.
- But even last time, like last time,
I three up multiple times.
- And that was like how
many times did you do that
with our other pregnancies?
- None.
- None, so it was like amazing--
- And so you just never know really.
So I just, I hate that
you always have to have
that little thing in
the back of your mind,
but you do.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- But as far as today,
that is how I'm doing.
- And we're in heaven right now.
Shangri-la.
(Ellie laughs)
Look.
-  So it's just one.
-  Yeah.
-  Did you hear that Ellie?
Just one.
(Jared laughs)
-  See the heart right there?
-  Yes.
(Calvin vocalizes)
-  That's a baby.
(gentle music)
-  Oh.
-  That's your sibling right there.
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- I want to see.
- That's crazy,
-  I can see a little flutter.
-  I know.
You can see the heartbeat
moving, isn't that cool?
End of June, first of July?
-  Mmm-hmm.
-  Oh my goodness, a summer baby.
(Jared laughing)
-  We, huh?
-  Ellie.
- Yay.
-  Yay.
- Oh, huh baby go?
- Where'd the baby go?
(laughing)
- You'll see him plenty or her.
-  That's cute.
- That's cute.
- Aww, that's so sweet.
- Is that the baby home?
- Yeah, is that the baby's home?
- Yeah.
- That was funny.
- Yeah.
- What did you think of that?
(Calvin vocalizes)
(Jeremy laughs)
What is that for?
Those are called stirrups.
Ellie.
- That all happened really fast,
I didn't have much time to react.
- I know I heard three or four heartbeats
and then she turned it off.
Oh Ellie, we heard our baby's heartbeat.
- Yeah, that was awesome.
- That was amazing.
You know what, just hearing the heartbeat,
(snaps) something changes.
- Holy cow.
It makes it more real.
-  Yeah it does.
(Calvin vocalizes)
That's our little baby.
(laughs)
Did you hear that heartbeat.
- Yes.
Did you see our baby?
(sighs)
- Do you remember--
- A little bean.
- coming home with this picture,
but with Jackson?
-  Yeah.
- Oh my gosh.
We're doing it again.
- I'm so
I didn't know what to expect.
I think you always think the
worst, especially after--
- Two back to back miscarriages.
- Yeah.
- You never lose that feeling,
is that worry, that increased heart rate,
you never lose that, it's always there.
I think even until you
have the baby in your arms.
- Yeah.
- But when you hear the baby's heartbeat,
when you see that flutter on the screen.
- Oh my gosh.
- Everything inside you changes,
I can't imagine what it's like for you.
- Oh and it just feels good.
It's like okay I have felt sick
and I'm going to be able to have a baby.
- Mmm-hmmm.
- There was a baby in
there, with a heartbeat.
- You've got a baby in your belly.
- Like we are gonna be a
family of three, we're--
- Well five, 'cause we're in the family.
(laughs)
- Well like three kids, that's crazy.
- We're outnumbered.
- Calvin's gonna move rooms.
Like he's gonna have a big boy room,
we'll make up the nursery.
We'll buy teeny tiny diapers.
- And little bootie socks.
- We'll find out our gender
around Valentine's day.
Like there's just so much.
- Holy cow.
- Like right now I'm nauseous,
I'm nauseous from morning 'til night.
And not bad, not like I can't do anything,
just it's a constant.
I don't feel well.
- But you haven't had that.
- And now
- with the other pregnancies.
- And I'm even happier.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(yelling)
(laughing)
It's weird to think like I'm
so happy I don't feel well,
but when it's this situation, you're like,
you're darn right I am,
- You always, yeah.
- you know?
Yesterday we had our ultra sound,
and it's funny that it's
happening right now,
but I think Ellie's having
her very first craving.
Like she woke up this morning--
- Don't judge me!
- And was like just
craving mac and cheese.
- Well no what happened was,
I was up from 1:00 AM to four,
could not sleep.
-  Nauseous, yeah?
- Oh I was nauseous,
and I got some chocolate milk,
because for some reason that
always makes me feel better.
- Well yeah, that's chocolate milk.
It makes everyone feel better.
- And I was like, I'm
gonna make mac and cheese.
And I walked in the pantry,
we don't have any and I was like,
I don't think we've bought mac and cheese
for a year and a half,
- Yeah.
- because it's gross.
It's not good for you.
- It's not gross Ellie.
- I mean it's good,
- It's like not the best, you know?
-  It's not the
healthiest thing in the world.
- And so I was like every house
at least needs like a few boxes, you know?
-  Right.
- So I made Jared go out
and yes, this is my second
box, and I'm eating it.
(Jared laughs)
- So I've had, thinking back
to the other pregnancies
that we've gone through,
Ellie hasn't had like
really intense cravings.
This is the first time that I've noticed
it's like Jared, go to the store,
get this right now.
- Just go get it.
- So I had to make a note of it.
- Well the reason why I
was so extreme about it
is because,
(knocking)
Calvin (laughs).
-  He's wearing your heels.
(Jared laughing)
- The reason why I was so extreme about it
is like I feel so sick.
- Yeah.
- I have to eat.
- I feel nauseous.
- Mommy, Mommy!
- all day.
- Look!
- And I've felt that way
for several days, you know?
-  Dad.
- Look look, is that
your brother or sister?
Is that the baby?
(Jared laughs)
Is that the baby?
You like black and white,
so I wanted to show you.
(laughing)
-  You see extra good
in black and white, huh, don't ya.
Yeah, you're excited.
- Jared and I were just
- That's a good girl.
- Looking at the picture,
and I have felt crummy.
I feel like I just look like,
'cause that's how I feel.
- You don't look like that
- at all I swear it.
- I feel very
- very sick.
- But this is
- So I am eight weeks along.
I have the smallest little pudge.
It hit two days before China
that I wasn't feeling well,
throughout the whole day.
And I just darted home from church,
because I could feel it,
it's gonna come.
And I used to always just
throw up in a toilet,
and right now that sounds disgusting
to put my head anywhere near a toilet,
so I'm just gonna sit here
with my bucket and wait.
(laughs)
Uuhh.
We were gonna wait to announce
and I really feel like we might have
to say something sooner,
because I don't know
how I'm gonna get away
with doing daily videos and not doing much
and not feeling well.
And feel like I might have to explain
why I'm sitting on the couch all the time.
(laughs)
I don't know.
Uuhh.
I'm just glad we saw a heart beat,
because that makes me 1,000 times better.
I'm still worried.
But we saw a heartbeat and that is amazing
and it is worth every
bit of feeling crappy.
(sweet music)
(Ellie laughing)
-  Yes.
- Oh!
- You have a third grandchild.
(sweet music)
- Eight weeks!
- I didn't want to scare you before China.
(laughing)
- I know.
- Actually nine.
It's actually like nine--
- Well no wonder the smells made her sick.
(laughing)
(sweet music)
- Dad and I both want
to tell you something.
- Okay.
- Mommy and Daddy, we are pregnant,
we have a baby in my tummy.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
= Mmm-hmm.
- Baby.
- And it's starting to grow.
- Is this it?
Is this the baby?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- And guess what?
We went to the doctor
(Calvin vocalizes)
and we saw, and we heard
the baby's heartbeat.
- That means the baby's doing well.
- Yeah.
- And we wanted to tell you
that you're gonna have
another little brother.
- Or sister.
- Yeah.
- Maybe it's gonna be another Calvin.
- Maybe it'll be another Calvin.
- Where's baby from?
- He's the baby?
- Yeah.
- And they took a picture of the baby.
So that's what the baby looks like.
It's just a little little
little baby under my tummy.
You can hardly even tell.
- Is that the baby's tummy?
- That's Mommy's tummy
and that's the baby.
- Is this how big it is?
- Mmm-hmmm.
- Mmm-hmmm.
- It's like this big
right now in my tummy,
so it's really small.
- How big, Mommy?
- And then it's gonna
grow and grow and grow
and my tummy's gonna
grow and grow and grow.
Mommy and Daddy are praying really hard
that this baby will stay nice and strong.
- Just like me.
- I'm strong.
- Yeah strong.
- Just like you.
- And me.
- And really strong like Hulk.
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah,
- we want a Hulk baby
is what we want.
- Me Hulk.
- Strong baby.
(Ellie laughs)
So when you say your prayers,
will you pray for our little baby?
For your brother or your sister?
- Yeah.
I don't want a sister.
(laughing)
Is this a sister mom?
- That, baby.
- We don't know yet.
We don't know yet.
- We have no idea.
- Will you be--
- He wants to see the baby,
he's looking in my shirt.
- Will you be happy, if we have a sister?
- Yeah.
- Will you be happy, if we have a brother?
- Mommy will too.
- Mommy, Daddy and Jackson will too.
- Oh good.
- Good.
- Yeah we don't care,
we just want a healthy baby.
- Yeah, that is a baby, Calvin.
- I love you.
Happy gratulatchins.
- (laughs) Happy congratulations.
I love you.
Jackson asked to do something.
We said just a minute, we have
to film a clip real quick,
and we're like, do you
want to be in the video
or do you want to go play
and he said I want to be in the video.
So he's gonna sit here.
We officially are telling you guys
that we are expecting.
- This is crazy, it's
exciting, it's wonderful.
- I feel much better now that
the weeks have progressed.
I'm feeling much better about everything.
It is nerve wracking at first.
And I think it's so cute,
every morning, the moment I wake up,
Jared says, how are you feeling today.
And I'm always like, well
let me get out of bed
and I'll tell you the moment I get up,
how I feel.
- Let me just a--
- Let me wake up first.
- Let me get just going,
- get the cogs rolling a little bit.
- But it's crazy.
- We're pregnant.
- We're pregnant.
- Thanks you guys so much for watching.
- We'll see you next time.
- See ya.
- Bye
- Bye
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye bye bye baby.
