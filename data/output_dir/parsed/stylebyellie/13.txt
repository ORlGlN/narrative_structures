- Oh! (laughing)
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Excuse me, young man.
- The chances of that happening is like
the chances of you getting a Tesla.
- Oh my gosh.
Ellie? Ellie?
Grab onto my hand.
Good morning!
I cannot believe how much of
an improvement last night was.
- Now we're just frying pancakes.
-  What are we making?
- Um, this one's pancakes.
-  Pancakes!
Mom is making some pancakes right now.
- Last night was amazing sleep.
-  It was so good.
- I mean, especially with
that pillow, it's the best.
-  Ellie, I feel
like you're kind of spoiled
right now with that pregnancy pillow.
It's just like a cocoon of happiness.
- I'll spoil myself for the nine months,
and every day of my life. (laughs)
-  You get it, girl.
What's up, dude?
What are you finding?
- I was spinning, and I--
-  Oh my goodness,
look at Mario go.
Did you know we just celebrated Mario Day
not too long ago, a few days ago?
March 10th is Mario Day.
What does Mario say?
-  We didn't do anything for it.
- Let's-a go!
-  Let's-a go!
Ha-ha! Hoo! Ha!
It's-a me, a-Mario!
- Huh, hee, ha!
Me, mah!
-  (laughs) Good job, bud!
- Calvin say, "It's me, Mario!"
- Me, Mario!
-  (laughs)
As they're getting breakfast ready,
I wanted to tell you about Penny.
I kind of feel like
we've talked about Penny
a lot this trip, but she has just
been doing so good this trip.
We just got back from the dog run.
They have a little place where you can
let the dogs out, and have them go potty
and play with other dogs and everything.
And, you know, Penny's
personality, she's so friendly,
and she loves to see other dogs and play.
But she has been very
good to be by my side
while we're running around.
And so I'm just so proud
of you this trip, Penny.
We thought you were gonna
be the one giving us
lots of headaches and everything,
but it's not you at all.
It's the kids! (laughs)
No, the kids have
actually been pretty good.
Last night was awesome.
Yesterday was great, and today
is going to be even better.
I feel like we're just getting acclimated
and adjusted to all of this, the space,
what we need to do, and
things are going really great.
So very happy with how things are going.
You ready for another day, Penny girl?
(dog snorts)
Oh, yeah, there you go, just
had to cough up that hairball.
(relaxed music)
(Calvin vocalizing)
- Dad, why Penn lay down?
-  She laid down?
Well, why were you yelling at her?
- Don't want touch this.
-  You want her not to touch that?
- Uh-uh.
Hi, Penn.
-  'Kay, we gotta get dressed
so we can go on a walk with her, okay?
- No, wanna see Penn.
-  Let's go play!
Let's go get dressed so we can go play!
Hey, did you get into my pads?
What is that?
-  That's a little popcorn sticker.
-  Oh! (laughs)
- But not quite as absorbent
as you might think.
- That was the funniest thing.
Jared and I were getting
ready to go out today,
and this whole trip is really just to be,
like, out in the sun.
There are so many cool things
to do in Vegas with kids.
But we are going to
come back with the kids
actually pretty soon, and
do that kind of stuff,
but right now, we're just
taking Penny, going on hikes,
going to parks, just being outdoors.
So, Dad has figured out where we're going,
we have to get dressed, let's go.
This view is okay.
- Yeah, it's just all right.
It's okay, right?
It's not that great.
Whoa! It's beautiful!
Look at that over there!
Look at that over there!
-  This is
beautiful, much prettier.
-  It's amazing!
Yeah, I don't know what
they were doing back there,
that was ugly, but this is scenic, oh man.
Move that sign, ladies and gents,
because that valley is on fire.
-  (chuckles) This is beautiful.
- The valley's on fire.
It is beautiful.
But do you want to know what the
most beautiful view in the world is?
(tooting noise)
- (laughs) I look so--
-  It's right, it's right here.
- I'm so pregnant.
I can totally tell my face is filling out.
Huh? Huh, baby?
Crazy.
-  Campground is full?
Can't camp here.
- This place doesn't have an ocean.
-  No, this is really dry, huh?
- And really soft sand.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey!
(upbeat music)
-  Hey, Dad!
-  Hi!
-  Up there!
-  They're all the way up there!
-  Yeah.
-  Jared, we made it!
-  Oh my gosh, Jackson just climbed
that whole thing by himself!
- There was the cutest
little boys that climbed up,
and they're like 10, and
he's like, "I'm gonna do it."
I'm like, "Okay."
Didn't think he'd make it.
-  Are you okay up there?
- Yeah.
-  Do you wanna trade me places?
- Nope.
-  Okay.
You're so brave, Jackson.
-  I know, Dad.
-  Oh, yes you do know. (chuckling)
Whoa! You guys are climbing so high!
-  Yeah.
-  Is it so awesome?
-  Yeah.
-  Can you make it up, bud?
Grab onto my hand!
(grunting)
Good job! (laughing)
Good job, Jackson!
You helped Calvin out!
You did it, Cal!
That's brotherly love right there.
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Are you guys having fun today?
-  Yeah.
-  Hey, can you
do that with the baby
when he needs to come?
-  (laughs)
So I think if you look
closely on that black part,
there is a spiral part, which I think is a
peroglyph or teroglyph
or something like that,
like a fossil-like thing.
And this whole area right over
here is called Mouse Tank.
Yeah, Mouse Tank.
In the 1890's there was an
outlaw who had come out here
and, like, hide away, 'cause
down in that little area
over there, there's a
little water reservoir,
and there'd be water there
for months out of the summer.
So this is a cool little cove
area that we just explored.
You guys ready to rock?
-  Yeah!
- Yeah!
Look guys, we are in a cave.
Is this so cool?
I wonder if there's something
that lives up there.
- Maybe there's a ghost.
-  Maybe.
These boys are looking
through a tiny, tiny hole,
and Mom's taking a picture.
- I love you.
- No, I love you.
- I don't feel like I ask a lot in life,
but today, I'm making a request.
All I really want to see is a rock
that looks like an elephant.
Is that too much to ask?
I just want to see a rock
that looks like an elephant.
- The chances of that
happening is like the chances
of you getting a Tesla.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Which is pretty great, so
go find an elephant rock.
- Oh my gosh, you heard it!
Oh my gosh, Ellie? Ellie?
That's a rock that looks like an elephant.
That's a rock that looks like an elephant.
Dream is fulfilled!
We did it, and it only took two minutes!
I don't see exactly how
it looks like an elephant.
-  You can totally see it!
-  But that sign right
there says it's an elephant.
- The trunk, the mouth.
I saw pictures online, people said
it's looked worse the last few years
than it used to, like with
the drought and stuff.
But I think it looks good!
- Yeah, I think it looks like,
kind of like an elephant.
You can see the leg and
the trunk and all that.
- You're gross.
You're gross. (kids laughing)
You're gross.
Ew! (kids laughing)
Where did you learn to pick your nose?
-  Are you kidding me?!
-  (laughs)
Did your Mom teach you
that, or did your Dad?
Who taught you to pick your nose?
That's gross. Me?!
You better say your Dad!
(Jackson laughs)
Who taught you to pick your nose?
-  Ellie, you spend more time
with your finger in your
nose than in your pockets.
-  Hey, who taught
you to pick your nose?
- Um, you.
-  Me?!
Did Penny? Penny did it.
- Yeah.
- Let's blame it on Penny.
-  No, Mom's the culprit.
(kids laughing)
- No, I don't want to open
your fruit snacks for you!
I want to open it for me!
I'm just trying to put on
my socks. (Jared laughs)
You are driving me crazy!
-  He is enforcing a choke hold.
To try and get you to open that.
- He's strong!
Do you want me to open it?
Want me to open it?
Hey, can I have one?
-  Uh, yeah.
- The tax that Mom gets.
-  The Mommy tax.
-  No, this is mine!
- That one's yours?
- Uh-huh!
- I did a jump crash!
-  Yes, you did.
'Kay, are we ready?
We're all in our pajamas, we're all clean,
and we have a movie ready.
This is fun!
- We're gonna cuddle.
Last night, Dad didn't
get to watch a movie.
-  Yup.
- He was trying to find a
bajillion places for internet.
- Yeah, having internet is important,
and uploading videos is
important, and we finally
got fast internet.
-  Ah, Calvin!
You dropped half of 'em, you turd!
-  Oh no!
Party foul.
- You just dropped 'em, eat it!
-  You guys ready
to watch this movie?
- So Dad's gonna watch a movie with us.
-  Yeah, let's do it!
- Uh uh, oh oh!
- Excuse me, young man.
- (chuckling) He thinks this is his.
-  Yeah, that is my spot.
I'm cuddling next to Mom.
-  And this is my pillow!
-  Hey. (imitating punching sounds)
- Hey, Dad, I saved you a small spot.
-  Oh thank you so much.
-  Next to--
- A sliver next to you.
Shh.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
- We're playing dogs.
-  You're playing dogs?
What kind of dogs?
Penny dogs?
- No! Little dog. (imitates dog bark)
-  Little dog? (chuckles)
Are you guys having a good night?
- Yeah.
-  Have you had fun on our trip?
- Yeah!
-  Good. What's
been your favorite part?
- Swimming.
-  Swimming was
a lot of fun, wasn't it?
Calvin, did you have a favorite part?
- Um, mn-mm.
-  No? (laughs)
Okay, pills!
- The lights.
-  The lights?
- Uh-huh.
- He liked the lights.
-  Oh.
-  Cool, the lights, huh?
If you guys don't remember, every time
we do a camping trip or
something, we take the little,
the polaroid, and we have our little book.
Here, let me show ya real quick.
-  Uh, don't show the first one.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
(shudders) If you guys
remember, our first trip
didn't go the smoothest.
- We were sick, and I was
in the bathroom, ha ha!
- Yep, okay.
So every trip we have taken polaroids,
and then this one was
from the solar eclipse,
and this one was this morning.
We had to leave Penny
out, because she kept
trying to get the food.
So that is our fun adventure.
And you guys just got a new polaroid.
- 'Kay, you were a stinker,
and got wasn't in it.
-  (laughs) Hey
boys, can you say goodnight
to our friends?
- Goodnight.
-  Do you wanna
take one of Daddy and I?
-  Night. Yeah, take one of us.
'Kay, ready?
-  No, me, us.
-  Take it of us.
Point it down.
(camera clicks)
Oh! (Jared and Ellie laugh)
We'll see how that works.
- It'll be a good one.
We'll keep it.
- We will keep it.
All right, that is gonna be it from us
on our quick, little, fun getaway.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
We're anxious to use this little trailer
more and more throughout
this year and years to come.
And we will see you guys next time,
as we drive all the way back home.
Bye.
Quick bonus clip!
There's the one we just took of Jackson.
-  It's coming,
and it's both of us.
-  Oh, cute!
You got our faces, Jackson, good job!
- And I think he just
took one of Calvin's head,
let's see how--
-  That Jack!
-  Yeah, that is Jack.
Starting to go.
'Kay, see you guys!
