- Hey guys, it's Jared
and I have a blog with people.
- What's up?
- These are the people
that I love them so much.
And this is my evil twin.
- Is that what I sound like?
- Do I really sound like that?
Hey, hi guys.
Hey how's it going?
- Hey what's up?
- Hey dude,
- Hey sexy.
- when you're ready,
-  I'm ready.
- we're doing like a walkthrough.
-  Yeah, let's do it.
- Do you wanna go see the space?
- Yeah, everyone say hi.
Hi guys.
- Hey.
- We're here at the broadcasting building
and we're walking into the
place where the magic happens.
Stacey is gonna show us everything.
- We're behind the scenes right now,
-  Oh my goodness gracious.
- so you're getting a little sneaky peaky.
We have all these, you're
gonna see these challenges
in action, but this is kind of the space.
This is the game show space
we're gonna be using right now.
-  This looks like a legit studio
game show place.
- Oh it is.
(laughs)
-  That's so cool.
- Like not all the time, but today.
- Like--
- We have some of the brilliant minds
and muscles behind everything going on.
-  This is so cool.
I feel like I could stand up here
and say, hello I'm Chris Harrison
and welcome to The Bachelor.
You know I feel like
I could say that here.
- The Bachelor on YouTube--
- Or like (laughs),
I'm Drew Carey and this
is The Price is Right
or something like that.
- Yeah.
- It's so cool.
- Okay.
-  This looks great.
- So they've already read us the rules,
and we're gonna walk through the game,
so we can be familiar as the hosts.
- Perfect, yeah.
Stacey and I are hosting this place up.
- This is gonna be so hosted up.
- Dude, straight up hosting.
- You have no idea.
-  Oh my goodness.
(cascading ice)
- Are you ready for this dude?
- You ready?
- I am.
You're doing this with me, right, so.
- Well I guess it depends on
how well the person throws it.
- I know.
I'm really hoping that
your team loses this one,
like more than any of
the other competitions.
- This is way too much ice.
-  This was full.
-  Yeah yeah, it
was like up to here of ice.
Oh jeez.
I think that's good guys.
I think that's good.
(cascading ice)
- Is this yours?
- Awww!
- Oh, it's like a foot deep.
- That's a lot of ice.
- It's like a foot of ice.
- That's a lot of ice.
-  Yeah, I don't even
know if we'll break through it.
- Oh my goodness.
- I don't think we'll break through it.
That is so much ice.
- Oh my gosh.
- You're going to
potentially fall in there.
- Wait who is it, who's on this one?
-  Me and Matt.
- You and Matt?
- Me and Matt.
- That's great.
- You're gonna need a lot more
than your matching t-shirts
to beat my team of YouTubers.
(cheering)
- Welcome to the burn simulator.
(cheering)
Oh my goodness.
-  You can do it.
- I can do it.
- You can do it.
- I think we just won.
I think we just won this.
(laughing)
(bell dings)
(cheering)
You should probably lay
low for a little bit.
You look like you're in trouble.
- Full of frozen ice water.
-  Ooh.
-  Gentlemen
load it up with the ice.
Final touches.
-  More ice, more ice!
More ice, more ice!
More ice, more ice!
More ice!
-  Look at these
kids out in the snow.
They found a cat, one
of our neighbor's cats
jumped our fence and
it's the nicest cat ever
and these kids are going over,
and the cat's just letting them pet it.
Like how sweet is that?
-  Jackson has
picked it up a few times.
- I know and it's just like okay,
I'm just gonna purr right here,
while you pick me up.
-  Look at 'em like herd,
like crowd around the kitty.
- I know.
-  They're like come here.
Oh and there's snow on his back now.
-  Follow me this way guys.
Let's go out in the sun where it's warm,
as you pet me.
Follow me this way, chop chop here we go,
into the sun.
I'm just gonna rub against
this fence real quick.
Oh yes.
- Awww.
-  Awww.
-  Wa wa, sorry
boys you can't cut through
the fence like that.
-  That was funny.
- That was funny, it was cute.
Oh there's Lincoln.
(Jared laughing)
He finally made it.
Hey guys, where'd the cat go?
Okay, gotta find something else to do now.
Let's go down the slide.
(laughing)
As you wish.
(laughing)
Jackson is a penguin.
-  Look at that.
-  And the two
babies are still like,
please come back, we'll lure
you in with a handful of snow.
(laughing)
-  And over on
this side of the fence,
we've got a dog.
(Jared laughs)
♪ Dun duddle dun dun dun dun dun ♪
♪ Dun duddle dun dun dun dun dun ♪
♪ Going down the slide so fast ♪
♪ Is what I really like to do ♪
Three two one go!
- Oh!
(laughing)
- Oh the cat's back!
- The cat's back.
-  The cat's back!
That cat's back!
(laughing)
I told you he'd be back.
-  Tell Calvin, get up there.
-  Calvin, turn
around, the cat's back.
Calvin look behind you.
The cat's back.
Jackson, the cat's back.
Go say hi.
- Okay.
-  Okay.
-  I don't know
what that cat's thinking,
but I'm happy.
-  Look they finally spotted him.
Get him Calvin.
- I think we have to disclaim.
We normally wouldn't
be petting strange cats
but we know that--
-  This is our neighbor's cat.
- Yeah.
- So we know it's good.
-  I mean, if Penny
was outside right now
she'd be going crazy.
-  The cat would not be here,
if Penny was outside right now.
-  The cat would be eaten.
I'm surprised that--
- And it's gone.
- Awww.
-  Boston, you overzealous.
-  That was really funny.
- Let's go slide down on
our bellies again Boston,
that was fun.
- Bonnie and I are just
sitting hanging out.
And the kids are playing.
And I think both of our kids
needed someone to play with today,
so it nice that we have cousins.
- Yeah, thank you.
-  So close, but it's cute.
We're literally sitting here,
we've been watching them play
for probably 40 minutes.
Oh my gosh guys, we might have
to get a cat too.
No Penny would hate that.
- How does Calvin even know?
He's like picking him up.
He's rubbing his face against it.
- Calvin is holding that cat,
and the cat is not--
-  Not running away.
- He keeps picking it up,
and the cat is just still staying by him
when he puts him down.
- I cannot believe that.
Put me down.
He's carrying him.
Calvin's like no, let me help you.
-  Oh now Jackson took him away
and he's picking him up.
(Bonnie laughs)
And he's being so good.
Okay, I'll have to text
our neighbor and tell her,
that her cat is actually cute.
Because usually when it comes in the yard,
we're like get out of here,
because Penny's like, we're done with you.
That was cute.
- That was the sweetest.
- Jared.
- What is going on?
- The cat is not running away from Calvin.
-  Because he knows he loves him.
- Calvin is--
- Aww.
- Look at him pet it.
- Well and look at him pick him up.
Look, yep, there he goes,
he's picking him up.
(laughing)
- Oh my gosh.
- That cat's probably not old.
That cat's probably still a kitty.
Oh and then Lincoln's hitting it with--
- Yeah yeah.
- Now he's gone.
- Way to ruin it for everyone Lincoln.
Cat's like I'm done.
- Guys guys guys guys
guys guys guys guys guys,
Joel just called me.
- Are you gonna go to the movies?
- I think Joel and I
are gonna go to a movie.
Ellie can I go to a
movie with Joel, please?
- Oh my gosh I feel sick
that you're vlogging and asking me this,
because I don't want anyone--
I don't care.
- Well of course I can go.
- Can I go to the movie?
- But it's funny to
come down here and ask.
You're watching a movie right now.
Guess what?
You've been a bad boy.
- Hey, you just came
- downstairs and disrupted
what I was doing.
-  Uh-oh.
- Get out of here.
-  You bet it, you bet I am.
- Have fun.
-  We will.
- Cheer Joel up for me, okay?
-  I will.
- He's falling asleep.
-  Oh I'm so sorry.
- Hey have fun.
- Okay.
- I really would like an
Instant Pot for Christmas.
(laughing)
Bye.
- Okay bye.
- I'll put in a good
word with Santa Claus.
- I knew he would be asleep any second.
He came up to me, and was like ahhh,
like he just wanted to cuddle.
I knew he was tired and he fell asleep.
From when Calvin was three day sold,
I knew he was a cuddler.
I remember putting him on my bed,
and I was getting dressed
and he was whining and crying,
and I remember thinking,
I thought babies were supposed to sleep.
Like it was so weird that
the moment I put him down,
he was kind of whiny.
And he's always been such a cuddler.
Hey hey, are you guys having fun
or are you fighting?
- Lincoln's not having fun.
-  Are you having fun?
And these boys back here,
they are all playing with Lego's.
So cute.
I love seeing our boys play
and sleep.
(Jared whistles)
-  Come here puppy.
Puppy puppy, aww, good puppy.
Do you want a treat?
- He's been a good puppy.
-  Aww, that's so cute and sweet.
Oh, Mommy's calling you.
Good puppy.
- Aww, what a good puppy.
- Puppy Calvin, Calvin.
- Good doggie.
- Aww.
- I used to act like a
dog until I was like 12.
(Jared laughs)
- Calvin?
- Mmm?
- The dog talks.
- Oh yeah.
(laughing)
- Oh yeah.
He said oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.
- You may have noticed that Ellie and I
have our matching sweaters on.
Cookies for Santa, nay!
- It's so cute and comfy.
- Cookies for me.
- And I think we're
gonna wear the same thing
tomorrow for the party,
- the neighborhood party.
- Oh we totally will.
- We'll wash 'em and wear 'em tomorrow.
- Absolutely.
We have a neighborhood party
and I'm playing the guitar for it
and I'm not, I'm nay prepared.
I need to practice and play more,
because it's gonna be
embarrassing if I play
the wrong notes in front
of a lot of people.
-  No you're good.
- But I filmed with
Studio C the other day,
and we had this crazy contest competition
and it just went live on YouTube.
So Ellie and I are gonna grab our phones
and we're gonna sit down,
and we're gonna watch it
as a family, all one hour of it.
- Oh careful please.
Where they dunk you
in ice water.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh my gosh.
It was a foot of ice water,
very very cold, I'll have
a link to it down below
if you guys want to check it out.
(bright music)
I probably shouldn't say this,
I might get reamed for saying this,
but pregnancy's kind of weird right?
Can we agree with that?
Pregnancy's kind of weird?
Ellie's like what are you saying?
Anyway, real quick, what I mean to say
is what pregnancy does to you
(laughs) is kinda weird.
I think Ellie's cravings are leaning
toward the cheesy side.
Everything that Ellie's
wanted as a craving
has cheese involved with
it some way or another.
- Don't judge me.
- She has just--
- She says don't judge me.
Don't worry Ellie, we're not judging.
It's not you we're judging,
it's what it does to
you that we're judging.
She's like Jared go get me
a cheese pizza right now.
I need it stat.
So I'm going to get a
cheese pizza right now,
because pregnancy is cheesy apparently,
at least for this one
right now with Ellie.
Okay seriously, I'm not trying to be rude,
I'm just saying it okay?
It's just, I don't know,
I'm digging myself in a deeper hole Jared
and you need to stop while you're ahead,
or not that deep down.
Okay bye.
(playful music)
-  What can I get for ya.
- Can I get a half cheese,
half pepperoni pizza?
-  Alright, anything else I can
offer you tonight?
- No, I think that should be it.
I got your pizza and you've
got a little dinner buddy.
- Well I do feel a little weird,
you're like Ellie wanted pizza now.
I ate lunch.
I never skip dinner.
-  Yeah.
- And I was wondering, I was
like I feel worse tonight,
like my head hurts and I'm sick
and I shouldn't be eating pizza.
But I totally skipped dinner.
Like I fed the kids and I'm like,
I didn't eat since lunch.
- Yeah, so like you're starving.
And cheese, pregnancy
or something like that,
I don't know.
-  I guess I like cheese.
- Whoa my voice just went like crazy.
- How sexy.
- Anyway.
- So it's the deep voice, okay,
I'll practice that, Jared remember that,
remember that, remember that.
- Moo.
-  You want more?
- No, moo my.
-  Oh you want your moo.
Okay, I'll show you what his moo is.
-  Say neigh.
- This is his moo.
This is his moo.
You want your moo?
-  Yeah.
- It's a horse.
Say horse.
He's saying moo.
He's going (whispers) moo.
Say horse.
Say neigh.
- Neigh.
- There you go.
(Jared laughs)
Half neigh.
Well, we're back in the pantry.
That is it from us today guys.
Let us know in the comments down below,
if you are a dog person
or a cat person and why?
That is something I would
like to know from you.
Thanks for watching guys,
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
