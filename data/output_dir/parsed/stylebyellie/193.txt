(laughing)
(twangy lively music)
- I've been walking like
this for 30 minutes,
just trying to get across the kitchen.
I just need to go to the bathroom.
(bright music)
Good morning Calvin.
Oh, are you trying to open that?
You want some more?
(sweet music)
Oh jeez, good morning Penny.
(Jared laughing)
It's nice to see a tidal wave
of eruption of happiness and joy.
You look like a little bear
in that little robe of yours,
you know that Calvin?
Ooh, bear kisses and bear hugs.
That's a great way to start the morning.
-  I got me some bear kisses.
(yelling)
-  Push up.
-  Look at you do it, bud.
(Ellie laughing)
Okay, we're doing our work out.
Calvin, are you gonna get
down there and work out?
- So our day is just beginning,
but we've already done so much.
We did our work out.
I took Penny for a walk.
We're getting ready for the day
and we've got a lot of stuff going on.
And I already feel so great.
I just did one work out,
Ellie and I did and the
kids were there too,
it was really cute.
But, the biggest part of this
is mental and physical changes,
something to make me feel
better in different ways
to make me happier too.
And it's already making that effect.
And I feel like doing things,
like these little check ins.
It's gonna be helpful for me
and maybe some of you guys
who are doing something similar.
So I'm already feeling great,
and it's time to tackle the day.
- We are ready to go.
I've got the kids some snacks.
They just got their hair cut done.
Calvin sat so good while I did it,
just like that.
He was quiet and put his hands down
and didn't even make eye contact with me.
Boo!
Boo.
(Ellie laughing)
He's a little mad, he wants his snack.
Okay, you fold your arms,
you be a little mad for a minute.
Jackson, let's see your hair.
Wow, that looks good.
So we got your hair cut done.
We even cut Jare's hair.
It looks so good.
Should we run errands?
Ready, set, go.
- Let's do it!
-  That's what you wanted, huh?
You wanted a snack.
Come here.
-  I want to take my bike.
-  You want to take your bike?
- Yeah, I want to take it.
-  Ooh I don't know if the stores
will let us have a bike in there.
-  Someone is
getting a little antsy.
The one thing that you wanted to do
was bring your bike with us.
So we have been running errands,
and Jackson was like can we please
take my bike. please.
So we did just that.
Boom, baby, here's your bike.
Now there's one rule okay?
You have to go slow and you
have to go next to us, okay?
And we're gonna make sure you don't go out
in the street or sidewalk
or anything crazy like that.
Okay, no back flips either.
I don't want to see any back flips.
(playful piano music)
- I'm Jared.
- You are?
What makes you look like Jared?
- You're not Jared, I'm Jared.
I'm Jared, I'm Jared.
- Who are you now?
- I'm Jackson.
- Ellie kiss me on camera,
so people know we love each other.
- This is your motivation for the day.
- Oh wow, I am motivated!
-  Bye, Mr. Cal.
Bye bye.
- Say bye Mama.
- Bye.
(laughing)
(twangy bright music)
- I've been walking like
this for 30 minutes,
just trying to get across the kitchen.
I just need to go to the bathroom.
(laughing)
- You want to get 'em on video.
This is good stuff to pass down
to your kids.
(laughing)
'Cause we're gonna be dead soon.
- And that is why we're vlogging.
So Jackson can see Grandpa do peaches.
Good afternoon guys,
we are just waiting for Beau to show up
and that is all of the siblings but Julie.
We miss you Jules, okay,
so many people have been commenting
on all of our stuff,
and have said oh your mom has posted
tons of pictures of her canning,
you guys should go can with her,
and that is exactly what we're doing.
The siblings are together.
All growing up we would always
get together and we would
can and bottle stuff,
and I think I probably have the record
of breaking the most Mason jars.
- If you want a box of
peaches, you're gonna help.
-  Yeah, yep.
- Scaled down cheese grater.
- Like take a picture of a cheese grater
and have that as the page,
you know, the numbers?
So with Mom's cheese grater.
- Oh with Mom's cheese
grater as the numbers?
- So we want to do in everyone's kitchen,
so we'll do some recipes in mine,
some in Ellie's, some in Ruby's,
and on on yours, we definitely
want to do the grape
so we can have your barn.
- No, I want it in my house,
because those are my grandkids.
I want it at my house.
- Yeah, I think this would
be the best place for it.
- And then we'll have to
shove 'em out the door
and then everybody can just clean 'em up.
- And this is something
Ellie and I thought
for a long time, is it's like okay
if we don't get this done now,
it's not gonna happen.
We all have so much that we're like,
oh I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this,
and if this didn't happen right now,
it wouldn't have happened.
- Well and unfortunately
the kids aren't getting
any younger, they're getting older.
And it'll be soon enough
that Ruby's having
Thanksgiving on her own.
Because her kids and their family
is coming together.
It's a natural process of family's
-  Evolving.
- Devolving, dissolving?
- We are on a mission
to dissolve the family.
(laughing)
- No, well they just get so big,
that they kind of.
-  And you want your own time.
- Yeah.
- It's not that you want to tear away
and break the family up,
but it's just something that happens.
We want to do this now,
while we're still young.
- And mostly we want to do this
before Ruby's channel gets too big,
and she won't want help us.
(laughing)
- I deserve a bigger cut.
- We thought the idea was
going to be to help you.
And now.
-  That was before
anyone had channels.
- you're gonna help us.
-  That is the funniest thing.
- And that is a wrap
of our family meeting.
You guys probably already picked up
what we were talking about.
Our family is working on a long project
that we've talked about,
like Bonnie says, before
Ruby and anyone else.
I think you maybe had a channel.
- It had just barely started.
- But I had talked about doing a cookbook
and then doing a family cookbook,
and it's been in the works,
it's been talked about for a long time.
Today we are having a meeting,
we have a photographer,
we're going to be doing some cooking.
So this is gonna be a
fun, long year ahead.
- Thanks for getting the ball rolling.
-  I know, Bonnie
got it kick started so.
Good girl.
One two three
-  Griffiths cookbook!
-  Woo!
- So my family and I have
been texting each other
and my sister in law Maria told me
that there have been
some earthquakes in Utah,
and in southern Idaho,
specifically in southern Idaho.
Apparently there was like
a 5.3 on the Richter scale.
I can't remember off
I'm talking right now,
so I can't thing about
what scale they used.
Anyway, but, it was a 5.3 earthquake
in southern Idaho,
and that has been causing a
lot of other earthquakes here
in Utah, specifically Norman, Utah,
where we live.
I haven't been feeling any of it yet.
Jackson, have you been
feeling any earthquakes?
- Nope.
- Yeah, me either.
Did you know that
- Fruit snack.
- Oh you found a fruit snack?
Did you know that there's been
some earthquakes in Utah today?
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.
I've actually never felt an earthquake.
And obviously a lot of my friends
live in California, feel
earthquakes quite a bit.
And I think that's something
that I would kind of
worry about, because I've
never experienced it.
But Yellowstone had an
earthquake yesterday,
southern Idaho had an earthquake today,
Utah's been having some
small earthquakes today.
It kind of worries me a little bit.
I hope that everything's gonna be okay
and Utah has been known
for years and years
to be ready, I'm not sure what that means,
for a massive earthquake.
So who knows when that's gonna happen.
People have been saying
that for years and years,
and it's never happened,
so I don't know, we'll see,
we'll keep our eyes out.
Hey, if you guys are in southern Idaho,
did you feel the earthquake?
Anyone here in Utah, they
said you'd be able to feel it
all the way down to Salt Lake,
that's about an hour and a half, two hours
away from where we live.
So we're gonna keep
our feet on the ground,
see if we can feel any earthquakes
and go from there.
Okay, Jackson, your job,
is to let me know if you
feel any earthquakes, okay?
- Okay.
(lively music)
-  Well it's all fun and games
until the boys get hangry.
(Ellie laughing)
So Dad's got his food,
Beau's is coming.
We're working on peach pie filling.
We are doing three recipes today
of bottled canned goods.
- Sugar.
-  Don't tell, no one knows.
Mom can do this without cutting herself.
20 years of, 30 years of canning.
(laughing)
- Gotcha!
Whoa, whoa!
Okay, you guys ready?
- Yep.
- Here we go.
This is a story called,
What Does it Mean to Be Kind?
Being kind means smiling
at the new kid in class.
Giving someone a compliment.
Holding the door open for someone else.
Sticking up for someone
who's being bullied.
Seeing the best in people,
even when they're
struggling to be their best.
Did you guys have fun today?
- Yes.
-  Is your favorite part rocking
in the rocking chair, Calvin?
- Yeah.
(Jared laughs)
- I bet you guys are not
ready for bed yet, are you?
- Oh.
- No?
Oh, did he bonk your head?
Aw, I'm sorry.
- I bumped.
- You bumped him, huh?
Well that's what happens
when you're having a little
too much fun, sometimes you bonk heads.
Sometimes you bonk heads.
Okay, give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Give each other kisses.
Good.
Say good night to our friends.
- Good night.
-  Good night.
Calvin can you say bye bye to our friends?
- Bye.
- I came home to everybody asleep.
Guys I had such a fun night
starting a new project
with my family.
We have so much stuff that we are going
to be filming and doing in the next year
to contribute to this fun family cookbook.
A lot of emotions are gonna be in this,
we talked a lot tonight about how we want
the layout to be.
It's coming from our hearts,
and I'm very excited to do this.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
Don't forget to hit that subscribe button
and we'll see you tomorrow
on Jackson's first day of pre-school.
Bye.
