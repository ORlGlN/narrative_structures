(laughing)
(bright music)
- I need to go eat right now.
- I see Santa Claus.
- Because you are more manly.
- Oooh!
- What?
- What?
(laughing)
(stomping steps)
-  And here we have
in their natural habitat
two beautiful young blonde ladies,
cutting hair in the kitchen.
You can see that they take
the strokes very seriously.
- I just did a little at the bottom.
-  Just a little at
the bottom, as she says.
We don't want to take too much off,
because that would be bad,
according to their style.
Hi.
- Hi, good morning.
- Hello.
-  How are you?
- We've been up--
- Since the crack of dawn.
- Early.
- Our kids woke up and like, can we eat?
I'm like, wait 'til the sun comes up.
It's 5:30.
- That was early.
- They seriously have
been playing all morning
downstairs, it was super cute.
I got up at like six, saw them
and they were all playing
and you were like--
- I was out.
Landon let me sleep in.
- Oh good Landon.
- He made breakfast.
That's so fun.
- Well I came up and I
pulled out a box of cereal,
and Landon's like, I already
fed them all breakfast.
So I went and got a diaper
and he's like,
- Yeah, it was
I already changed the diapers.
- Landon and I together.
- Landon and I did the dishes together.
-  Aww, that's a sweet moment.
So you guys are doing your hair today,
what are we doing, tell
us what's going on.
So right now you've got about like
what 18 inches here?
- I know Julie's hair is so long.
Come look at the ground.
-  Okay, let's look at the ground.
-  Just a little trim.
-  Just a little trimmy trim.
It looks great.
Cuttin' about two inches off there?
- More like four.
-  Four inches, make sure you just
don't round the corners
off too much, okay?
- I know, I was like
I'm worried for Bonnie
to come and look at it.
Isn't that nice and straight?
-  It looks healthy
and crisp and great.
- Thank you.
- Good job.
- This is worth the two hour car drive.
- There you go.
This is some kind of Chinese flute
that we got in China.
Where did we get it,
it's a Chinese flute,
but where did we get it?
And this is the one
I've arranged things on.
-  Play it again.
(playing flute)
- Nerd.
-  Hey, I wake up
to that every mornin'.
(Ellie laughs)
- Jared, please serenade me to bed.
(flute playing)
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Boo.
(laughing)
-  Alright Penny's
hair, Julie's hair,
-  (laughs) Oh sick.
-  Penny's hair, Julie's hair.
I'm gonna vacuum it up.
I wiped it up, most of it,
but this will get rid of the little ones.
-  Yeah, so I--
(vacuum whirring)
-  I'm not listening.
(Ellie laughs)
(vacuum whirring)
Calvin, does even Batman,
Batman is going to see Jesus, huh?
Is that cool?
Calvin has been sitting by
the tree most of the morning
playing with the nativity set.
And he brought the truck,
and he brought the marble,
and Batman to come see Jesus too.
You're so fun.
You're so just quiet.
Everyone's downstairs and
you're just playing by yourself.
I was getting ready with
Julie and I was like
I need to go eat right now.
I was like I eat breakfast everyday,
like I had oatmeal and
strawberries this morning
and then at 10 o'clock I eat a meal,
like a pre-lunch.
And I came in the kitchen
and I looked at Jared
and I was like, oh look.
- Right on the dot.
- It's 10 o'clock.
It's 9:53.
I seriously was like, I
need to eat, I need to eat,
so I'm eating some leftover soup
that Bonnie made last night for dinner
and I need to get it in
my belly in 2.5 seconds,
or I'm gonna start dry heaving.
(laugh-crying)
(laughs)
Is it way way hot?
- It's a little warm.
-  Aww.
Let it cool off.
We have all the kids coloring.
They just got done watching a movie,
we were like, watch a movie,
we'll get ready.
Then the boys are gonna go to a movie,
and then we'll play
and entertain the kids.
So we're getting some
snacks out for the kids
and we're just coloring.
You're doing your letters.
Are you gonna color one Coop?
Trace one?
Oh you did the train a little.
That looks good.
Ready?
Ready Cal?
My favorite store in town,
and I've never been here during Christmas.
- You haven't?
-  It's beautiful,
all their decorations.
(gasps)
Good thing I didn't bring my wallet Bon.
(laughing)
Look at how cute it is in here.
I wanted to take you here,
and now we're here.
- I know.
(bell clanking)
(jingly festive music)
- I see Santa Claus.
- Are you gonna go with Calvin?
- No.
- You don't want to go?
Do you want to go with
Jackson to see Santa?
- No.
- No, what are you gonna ask him?
- To get a jack-in-the box and
a Roc glider
and a cowboy.
I need I need one more one more
-  Maybe a marble run?
- Oh yeah.
- What are you gonna ask him for?
- Big cookie.
- A big cookie, is what Calvin wants.
And even asked about talking to Santa
and hoping he can visit
some peoples' houses
that don't have any toys.
- Cookie, big.
-  You want a big cookie.
- Yeah, big cookie.
(Ellie laughs)
- This is fun to get out
with some of my sisters
and the cousins.
So fun.
You are waiting so patiently.
What are you thinking?
(Calvin vocalizing)
You're so quiet, are you a little nervous
or are you excited?
- Excited.
-  Good, do you
want to go talk to him?
Okay.
Hi.
- Hello there.
-  You want to
go sit up on his lap?
Not Calvin, here, you want to?
-  Yeah.
-  Good job, now up high.
- Awesome.
- Down low.
-  Too slow.
(Ellie laughs)
Good job.
-  Did you ask him Jackson?
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Big cookie.
-  Okay, that's what he wants,
is one big cookie and that's it.
- And your big cookie.
-  Jackson are
you on the nice list?
He has been extra good.
- Of course he is.
- Of course he is.
-  You've been good.
Say thank you.
- Thank you.
Thanks for coming to see me Spiderman,
I mean Jackson.
-  Okay, let's go.
Thank you.
- Take care.
-  We'll see ya.
- Bye bye.
Give me five again.
(Ellie laughs)
(festive music)
- Why do you have reindeer?
- Why do I have reindeer?
- Because they fly his sled.
- Then I don't have to buy gas.
They can even go faster than airplanes.
(bells jingling)
- Even faster than cars?
-  Oh totally.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye bye.
- Alright, so this is
the situation we're in.
The guys just got back from the movie.
We went and saw Thor.
Awesome, it was so good.
Now we're doing a little switcheroo,
and a little swaperino,
the girls are out doing something
and the guys are left here with the kids.
We've got Cody, Boston, Emma, Olivia,
Calvin, Cooper, Jackson and Porter.
And it's just us two.
- I know we are outnumbered.
- It's eight versus two.
So, what should we do.
- Good thing we're strong like Thor.
(growling)
- He gets to watch the girls,
you get to take care of the boys.
-  That does not
sound like even fairness.
- Because you are more manly.
- What?
- Ooooh!
- What?
(Olivia laughing)
-  Do you kids
want to play a video game?
-  Yeah.
-  Do you want to play Mario Kart?
-  Yeah!
-  Landon, what
do you think about that?
- Perfect.
- Okay.
Alright, let's go downstairs.
- Mario Kart, yeah!
- We're having a Mario Kart tournament.
Well I feel like the entertainment issues
have been solved.
You guys having fun playing Mario Kart?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
-  Who's winning?
- I won.
- Me.
-  Whoa, multiple winners.
Cooper are you having fun?
You're so into it, huh?
I love the Nintendo Switch.
It's the best console
for multiple reasons.
Not because the graphics are the best,
but because it's portable,
you can take it anywhere,
and it comes with two controllers.
These tiny little guys that Jackson has,
that's a controller
and then Cooper has the other one,
those are the controllers.
So out of the box it has two controllers
and that's a huge plus, I think.
Of course, I like the PlayStation,
of course, I like the Xbox,
those are awesome too.
And I like PC Gaming too.
But I have played more
on the Nintendo Switch
than any other console this year.
What have I said?
There is nothing better than
hearing a little kid laugh.
(raspberries)
(laughing)
(raspberries)
(laughing)
(muffled raspberries)
(laughing)
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- One more time.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
- Okay.
(growling)
(laughing)
- No.
- No more?
- No.
- One more?
- No.
- Two more?
- No.
- No more?
- No.
- Okay.
(growling)
(laughing)
- No.
- Can you say, I love you Dad.
(vocalizing)
(laughing)
(kissing)
-  What is he gonna have?
- Calvin has a question for you.
Well, are you gonna ask her?
Come on, ask her.
- Mommy bed?
-  What?
- Bed?
-  You in my bed?
- Yeah.
- He wants to sleep in our bed.
-  I'm not gonna lay with you.
- No.
-  You lay in my
bed and stay in bed okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
- 'Cause I wanna talk to my sisters.
(laughs)
And if this is gonna keep you quiet,
we'll do it.
- I'm trying to find the
quietest place in the house,
so I don't disturb anyone right now.
And it just so happens
to be the pantry I think.
I hope I don't wake anyone up.
Everyone is asleep and the night is over,
so thank you guys so much
for watching the video.
If you enjoyed it,
be sure to give it a big thumbs up
and we will see you tomorrow.
Oh, also let me know if you guys
