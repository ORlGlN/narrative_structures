Please don't make fun of me if this is
like an obvious answer
and everyone knows it.
Where you guys flying from?
- Kansas City all the way to New York.
- Good night.
I love you.

We are all out in the backyard
just having a good time.
These two pregnant sisters are being
pregnant together.
- The weather is wonderful.
- It looks cold, but it's not.
- Yeah, it feels really nice outside.
We've got some new arrivals coming in on
the most recent landing, flight A113,
coming in hot from, where
you guys flying from?
- Kansas City all the way to New York.
- Kansas City to New York.
That's an odd stop to come into Utah,
and they're coming in,
experiencing some turbulence here,
so we ask that everyone keeps their
seatbelts fastened.
- Oh no, someone peed their pants,
they got too nervous.
- Oh no, we should probably get some
extra clothing from the carry-on.
- No, we're just out
here having a good time
before the game starts
it's about one o'clock and
the game starts at four
o'clock our time I think,
so we're waiting for
family and friends to come
to get ready to rock and roll,
and to eat some delicious snacks.
Penny is loving having
all of the kids outside.
It's finally warm enough that we're like
playing out here and having
a good time, ya know.
Hey Penny, come here, she is so exhausted.
We have been wearing
her out left and right,
that's a good girl Penny.
- K, I'm hoping Penny goes back, yup.
- She is just laying in the snow watching
all the kids play, haha, look at her face.
Penny, girl, haha, is that yummy?
That is awesome.
Good girl.
So you know how the other day I tried a
new curling iron on my hair,
well not a new curling
iron cause (inaudible)
but I got my curling iron back, that one.
Tight on the top, loose on the bottom.
- Here, let me demonstrate.
- Julie's trying on her hair now.
I love it!
- It's fun to try new products,
especially at your sister's
house, so thank you.
- I know, you're welcome,
you look so cute.
We took a picture of
our bellies last night.
Look at that big belly
- (laughing) (inaudible)
- Mine doesn't look that big.
You're a little over a month ahead of me.
- Okay, please don't make fun of me
if this is like an obvious answer
and everyone knows it
- It's a steak knife.
- But, so you have avocados and then you
mash em up and everything, and then it
turns into guacamole.
It doesn't happen with potatoes.
You mash potatoes up,
they're mashed potatoes.
Why don't we call it mashed avocado?
- You call it guacamole
cause you add stuff to it.
- Do you though?
- Yeah, it's not just avocados, tomatoes
- We add stuff to mashed potatoes.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Ya add some garlic and butter and gravy
to mashed potatoes.
- Yeah, but this you add like tomatoes
and red onions and it's haha!
- Knife, holy cow
- You put that knife down.
- So, but yeah, you could do all of that
with potatoes too.
- True.
- I think it's its origin, right, so like
avocados are more like they're,
I don't know, to me like potatoes
- Boring!
- Potatoes are like grown
- We're done (laughing)
- In Idaho
- Too long a clip, stupid,
goodbye, done, reh, reh.
- So you're saying
because Idaho potatoes are
like oh yeah, it's a Idaho thing, it has a
different origins kind
of and then avocados
are from stereotypically
a different location,
then that's why?
- Correct.
- Oh, okay.
- Please let us know if
there's any other reason.
- Hey Jared.
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna tell all the
kids to come up and eat.
(light-hearted music)
- The time is almost upon us.
We have about thirty minutes until
the Super Bowl starts and I was thinking
we were gonna be down to the wire, so
what I did.
We have our t.v. and
then we have a sound bar
right here, and we don't usually use this
because it kinda is just annoying and it
gets in the way of the
kids and all of that stuff
and we don't want it to be a mess.
But we've got this subwoofer.
We've got a surround sound speaker here,
and a surround sound speaker there.
So, and it took me about a half an hour
to get it set up the way it should be,
like Vizio I love you guys,
like you make some really great stuff.
But it's a little too
complicated sometimes.
But we got the surround sound system going
so hopefully we'll have
some awesome football
experiences so we can listen to those
commercials and Justin
Timberlake perfectly, ya know?
Joe just gave me the
approval, he's like oh yeah.
- And the visual cause last year
was really good too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah his last show,
his last Super Bowl,
how many years has it
been since that incident.
- I don't know, but I do know this,
Bonnie and I missed it because
we were making out.
- That's the best kind of miss.
K we've got some chips,
we're bringing snacks down,
the party is about to officially begin,
kickoff is in t-minus 28 minutes.
♪Ba-da-bing-ba-da-boom
got the dip, dip, dip ♪
Ellie, we've got two
ovens, let's utilize them.
Let's get these pizza bites.
I know you're like, I know
your dip is nice and all,
but let's get these Tostino
pizza rolls in there.
- (inaudible) that crap
(light-hearted music)
- Alright, we're making the rounds.
Patriot's or Eagles?
- Eagles.
- Patriot's or Eagles?
- She doesn't know who's playing.
- I just watch the two year old.
- Well ya gotta through out
- They're making me laugh.
- Eagles or Patriots, pick one.
- Patriots.
- Patriots.
- I don't know, whatever one he votes for.
- Whoever has the most homeruns.
- There you go.
Patriots or Eagles?
- Patriots or Eagles?
- Patriots.
- Patriots? Patriots or Eagles?
Patriots.
Patriots or Eagles?
- Eagles.
- Eagles. Patriots or Eagles?
- Patriots.
- Patriots or Eagles?
- Eagles.
- Eagles. Patriots or Eagles?
- (raspberry)
- Yeahhhh. Patriots or Eagles?
- Patriots.
- Yeahhh, Patriots or Eagles?
- Patriots.
- Yeahhh. Here are my thoughts.
I would love to see the Patriots win,
but all in all I want to see a great
football game, a high scoring game on
both sides of the field where it's just a
fun game to watch.
That's what I want, I don't care who wins,
but it would be cool
to see Tom Brady like,
cement his legacy, you know what I mean,
like that would be cool.
- That's the one reason I'm rooting
for the Patriots, I wanna
see him break records.
- Right.
- Is this his last game?
- I don't think so,
I think he might play after this.
But, if he won tonight,
I wouldn't put it past him to retire.
By retiring with records
broken, I'll do that.
- Jackson, your turn.
- I'm gonna get that.
- that close, that close cheesecake.
(music)
- Ohhh, ho, ho, ho!
Calvin Say hi
- Hi
- You want some food?
- Say hi.
- Hi.
(music)
- Half time show, we
turned it down a hair,
so all these guys can play H...
- Two million people are playing.
- HQ, thanks Jackson.
Are you ready? Hold my
hand, I'll walk you to bed.
- Not ready.
- I remember growing up and when,
oh, wait just a minute, Calvin's asleep,
come here, I remember
growing up and cousins
would be here and it would be time for bed
and I would hate it, and I've warned you
quite a bit tonight
that bedtime was getting
ready, huh?
And you've been so good today, but it's so
hard to go to bed when
you know people are here.
But we're getting ready for bed and all of
our cousins are gonna get
ready to go home, okay?
Did you have a good day with everybody?
- Yes, but I want them
to have a sleepover,
all of them.
- I know, we'll see, Cooper might, okay?
Okay, let's be quiet, go to bed.
(soft music)
go lay down,
no we can't turn on the light.
Okay, I love you so much.
Please be good, stay in bed okay?
Say okay, you're not gonna stay in bed?
- Good night
- I love you.
- I love...
- I love you too.
- Well frankly, I'm not
sure who's more embarrassed
that we lost on the
third question of HQ or
Tom Brady dropped that
easily catch, ya know,
for he coulda got a touchdown on that one.
Half time is over, Justin Timberlake
did pretty great.
You guys having fun
watching the Super Bowl?
Are everyone's tummy's full?
- Happy the kids are in bed.
- I'm trying to refuel Jared, refueling.
- Refuel, energize, Mom
knows where it's at, yes!
- Kids to bed and bring
out the good stuff.
- Jackson and Calvin are
in bed asleep right now,
this is amazing.
Well I hope you remember
about who everyone
voted for for the Super
Bowl because the Eagles
are the Champions, but
now the real winners
of the Super Bowl are
us because we all get
to watch "This Is Us".
- Lana just popped all of our necks.
Like my chiropractor
appointment's tomorrow
and I've been getting a
headache today and I felt
like instantly, it's amazing (laughter)
- I should probably learn how to do that.
- You should, I love
going to the chiropractor
so my appointment's tomorrow.
- Nice, well we got through it.
We made it through guys, congratulations.
You made it through the
episode of "This Is Us".
Hey, I'm talking
- That was a wonderful episode.
- It was a heartbreaking, it was good.
It was like, uh, ya know, Jack.
- Well it's like that
season has like taken
names, it was all over
the news about like now
they're talking about like house fires and
kitchen fires because of the season,
people are loving, loving "This Is Us".
- Yeah, if you haven't seen
"This Is Us" it's great.
It's also great because,
I don't know, the actor
who plays Jack liked my Tweet.
- Milo
- Milo, I can't pronounce his last name.
- All the actors are awesome, awesome,
I love them.
- Yeah, they have all done so good and
we're done for the night.
Like, we've had a blast.
The kids had a blast.
