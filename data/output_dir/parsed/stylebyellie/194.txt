- No not again!
Oh my gosh Jackson's going!
You guys I think it's
time for a drastic change.
(happy music)
I tell you what!
I tell you one thing,
there's nothing quite like
sleeping in your own bed
and having a shower in your own house.
-  And using conditioner!
The last two times I washed my hair
I didn't have conditioner.
- The world is going to end!
You have energy power?
That's been the cutest thing.
Jackson's been playing
with these glow sticks
and then he calls them his energy.
And it makes me think
of like Dragonball Z.
I don't have enough energy
to continue the fight!
Calvin does though.
- I'm gonna save your head.
- No not again!
Not my freshly done hair!
-  Oh yeah seriously
you just did your hair.
Come on let's get ready
we gotta go to church!
- Guess what guys?
We have to go to church today.
Let's go wash your bums 'cause
your bums are stinky!
- What's the bum song?
-  Yeah sing the bum song Jackson.
(mumbles)
- It's time to wash your bumy!
- When you are ready for church early
you get to sit on your bed
and you get to eat a snack
and watch a movie and that
is just what we're doing.
I made some eggs and I'm
eating it with salsa.
I usually just eat it alone.
Jared always eats his eggs with salsa
and it's good but I just never have and
I really like it and I'm enjoying it.
Kids are watching a show.
We are watching Halloween Curious George
and speaking of Halloween and fall,
I have loved summer and I'm
going to miss the warm days
'cause I really am not into
the whole cold weather but
Utah gets really cold really snowy,
but I am looking forward to fall.
The fall weather,
the clothes Halloween.
Last year we had moved
into the house in October
and I had bought just a
few holiday decor items
just for like the mantle downstairs
but I've been looking
online and I'm excited.
I need to find a cauldron
because we're gonna make some fun
juice or some sort,
you know with boogers and eyeballs and
spiders to put in it.
I have a few small fun ideas for Halloween
that will be fun for the kids.
So that's what I've been
doing this morning but
on to our eggs,
on to picking our nose,
on to Curious George.
- So I spent the morning
doing something very special.
I was reunited with my friend Penny!
Come here Penny!
How are you girl?
I missed you so much!
I missed you so much!
Such a good girl!
Hey don't bite the camera!
You know from experience
that that is not a good idea
to get your camera close to Penny.
I've missed this girl so much.
She was with some friends
of ours while we were gone
and now I'm reunited.
Still scared to get my face close to her
'cause she's that excited.
And I also wanted to
show one other thing that
happened while we were gone.
As you guys know we
have this giant hot tub
which is like one of our favorite things
in the whole entire world,
and while we were gone we had something
installed for protection,
for security and for looks.
All the controls are
down here in the hot tub
and we have young kids
and we don't want the
kids to fall down in here,
even though they never
really come around here,
we just want to prevent that.
So we have this
to make it look all nice and cool.
Kids can come over here
and we can lift that up
if we ever need access in there.
I think it looks great don't you Penny?
(fun music)
I told you!
-  And lunch is prepared!
- It smells so good!
I'm so glad you made dinner.
- She's like have you made this before?
And I was like yes.
This was a HelloFresh that
I made like a few weeks ago
but you can just go to the store and
buy all the stuff you know?
Went to the store.
It's spaghetti Ragu
and it has zucchini,
ground beef tomatoes,
onion and obviously the spaghetti;
and it's really good.
-  Is that hamburger or pork?
And you said Ragu.
Is there pizza sauce or is it just-
-  It's just tomato stuff.
Like this is exactly what
the recipe calls for.
Just Beef Ragu,
that's all the stuff that's in it.
Should we eat?
- I think that's a great-
-  How was church?
Were you kind to people?
- I was kind to people.
-  Did you heart people?
- I hearted people and I'm
hoping you heart people to.
- I came home early with Calvin.
- Without fail anytime we
have kids over at the house
this comes out!
It's peanut butter jelly time!
Peanut butter jelly time!
Peanut butter jelly time!
Tell me what made you think to
put that on right now Olivia?
- I just want to be like a banana.
-  You just wanted
to be like a banana.
There are days where I want
to feel like a banana to
and that's exactly why we have it.
Alright kiddos I thought of a fun idea
and I need every single one of your helps.
I need your help.
All of you.
Your help thanks Olivia.
We have this giant big blue
slide right here right Cody?
And you love going down it don't you?
I love going down it.
Do you love going down it?
- I love going down it.
- I enjoy going down that slide.
- We go down the slide all the time.
The competition is we are
going to run up the slide
and we're gonna see who
can get the highest.
-  Who can make
it to the very top?
-  Oh my gosh Jackson's going!
Oh my gosh!
Oh he did it without hands!
Olivia or mom go!
-  I don't know how
to do it without hands.
-  Go Olivia go!
Oh my gosh.
My turn guys.
Alright here I go no hands.
Ellie I'm gonna run right through you.
No one's letting me have a turn.
Calvin it's my turn!
I just wanna run up the slide
and I don't wanna hurt anyone.
This is so stinking cute.
Here we go watch out Jackson!
- Trip over Jackson!
- There we go!
(screams)
I made it!
- Choo choo train!
-  Choo choo train?
Hold on guys.
I'm gonna send the camera down the slide
so Ellie can film the
choo choo train okay?
-  You guys gonna have fun now!
- Don't want Penny getting it.
-  Hold on guys!
- She'll grab it.
She's ready for it oh my gosh.
Here we go!
-  You girl I
saw your mouth open up.
Is everyone gonna go behind you?
-  Okay I've got a hold.
(applause)
-  Only one roll.
Pretty good no tears.
-  I'll catch you!
- I wanna do it again.
-  Look at his hands.
Look at his hands!
- He's trying to hold on.
We just said bye to Bonnie and the kids
and I'm just like where is Calvin?
Where is he?
And I'm calling his name and
I don't hear any response
and I hear some noises down here
and he's got this apron around him
and he was in the hello room
and he was scrubbing the dishes.
That's what he was doing.
Show us what you were doing Calvin!
He had this spoon and something
and he was rubbing them together.
-  What were you doing?
-  Show us what you were doing.
He put the apron on and did that.
- That's a good cleaner!
-  You are cheesy!
(mumbles)
Can I have a nibble of the cheese?
(laughter)
- My cheese costume you ate it!
-  It was so delicious!
Oh is that ketchup?
(mumbles)
- I wanna show you something.
I spilled juice on my shirt.
-  Oh you did oh no!
Don't worry I bet you we
can put it in the laundry
and make it all clean.
Should we do that?
Okay let's go do that.
Brush your teeth
'cause it is almost time for bed!
We gotta brush our teeth
and we gotta change into our pajamas
and have a good night huh?
- When the sheep says...
does he really mean...
And the cats say...
You guys I think it's
time for a drastic change.
Ellie and I have been doing
good on various things.
We've been trying to eat healthier,
we've been active,
we've been working out,
we've been taking Penny
for a walk and everything,
but I'm still feeling
this weight holding me back.
Not physical weight but like mental,
physical and emotional
weight holding me back
and I think it's time for a drastic change
and I need to do this.
I need to do this for me Ellie you know?
You're more than welcome to
come along with me.
- And I will.
- We've been doing good but
we haven't been doing great
and I want to do great.
There's a good,
there's a better and the best.
We've been doing good
and I want to do my best.
That's a big part of this.
I feel like I've been doing
good but I can do better.
And that's the thing about it,
I've just gotta do it.
It's all or nothing!
It's time for something
serious and I did this two years ago?
When I said like I'm not
drinking Dr. Pepper for a year
and I did that.
I didn't drink Dr. Pepper or soda pop
for an entire year and
I need to do something
like that right now.
And I think being in North
Carolina with my family
was like a big catalyst to that.
Just being with my family
and being at the pool and it's like...
It's not that I'm like out
looking at myself when I'm...
It's nothing like that it's
just I want to feel better.
- Especially with your hips.
Jared and I have talked a lot it's like
you're not overweight at all
and I feel like we're pretty
active like as far as just like
daily like what we do and stuff but
one concern is
if you do get bigger it's
really hard for you to work out
'cause your hip hurts.
- And that's the other thing
'cause like with working out
a lot of these pains
that you have will go away.
A lot of your back pains,
your knee pains will go
away because your muscles
have been building up the
muscles that you haven't
used to the extent that you used to.
And that used to be me.
I used to be a collegiate athlete.
It's just like it's frustrating and I've
gotten to that point where I just like
I need to make a change right now.
So this is what I'm gonna do
and I need the accountability
and that's the other thing
is I need the accountability
so I'm telling you guys about it.
For one month right now...
Calvin is coming out
of bed and he's dressed
like he's a ghost.
For one month I'm going to work out
at least six days a week maybe seven.
And have like one cheat
day is what they call it
and that's pretty normal with workouts
and maybe I won't even do that,
but for one month I'm going to do that
and then I'm gonna have a review.
And then I'm gonna try
and go for two months
but I need to do this
and I need to tell you guys about it and
I just think it's time for a change
and I'm gonna start being
more committed and doing that
because I think physically
it's gonna help me out
and a lot mentally to.
I feel like I've kinda been in a slump
the past little while
and I think this is gonna
help a lot with that.
Getting up working out.
Walking the dog,
I do that everyday anyway but I feel like
that's gonna be a good warm up.
- Like get your heart
racing you know working out.
I had so much fun doing CrossFit
but it's hard leaving
the house to work out.
I think a lot of people
can relate to that.
It's hard to like do that you know?
- I've got a machine
downstairs and I need to use it
and so I'm going to.
Guys I'm telling you
so it's on the blog.
- You can do it!
- I'm gonna do it
- I'm proud of you.
We can do it.
We will do it.
We'll take Calvin to bed!
- Well guys here it is.
I started this a long time ago
and never got finished
but I finally finished
because I'm motivated.
Plus I have a little Marvel Defenders,
you know like Daredevil and
Jessica Jones and all that,
I've been watching that and that's been
really fun to keep me company
while I've been building that.
It is late at night and I'm
gonna have an early morning
'cause I'm gonna start everything.
So Roman Atwood wants to
have a demolition derby.
I think that's like
the coolest thing ever.
I was talking to my buddy Shonduras
who's actually confirmed
he's going to do that thing
which I think is so awesome!
I think it's fun that
Roman is bringing a lot
people together and that's
one of the coolest things about it.
I would love to do this,
whether I do or not,
this is gonna be so cool to have all the
creators come together
and all of the viewers
come together to this stadium.
I think it's gonna be pretty
cool to see it all unfold.
I don't think anything like
this has been done before.
I mean there's been
tours and everything but
even still I thought it was pretty cool.
A lot of you have been
tweeting me about that
and I think it's awesome so
can't wait to see how it unfolds.
I'm gonna call it a night.
Thank you guys so much
