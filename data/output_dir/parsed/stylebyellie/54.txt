- I need to get out of the house
and breathe some cold, crisp air.
- Whoa.
- Woo!
- Hold my bum!
I am rushing to the hospital right now.
This is crazy.
The doctors are gonna
take good care of you,
okay buddy?
Whoa it's a scary monster.
He's got claws. Oh no! Ah!
- Rar!
- I'm dead. You got me.
Good morning boys, how are you today?
- Good.
- Good.
Calvin, guess what.
It is first thing in the morning.
We gotta start potty training. Hello.
Say it. Hello. Ah.
I said it's time to start potty training.
We gotta wake up bright and early
and get our potty training on.
Well at least someone is
excited that it snowed today.
I just let Penny out, it's in the morning,
she just got outside.
The first thing she did
when I let her outside.
She looked around, saw that it snowed,
and she started rolling
around in the snow.
And I was like oh geez.
I'm done with the snow.
But I still have fun plowing.
I plowed last night, the
drive way. It was cool.
But I am ready for some warm weather.
Thank you for your suggestions
on warm weather places
because we're serious.
We may pick up, grab the
trailer, and go somewhere warm.
-  Okay, choose one for milk.
(gasping)
No! It's a carrot.
K, mama's turn.
Green leaf. Huh!
Here, you go now.
Umbrella.
Choose an umbrella.
Oh, what color is this?
- Purple.
Yeah!
- We are watching PJ Masks in our PJs.
What is your kids favorite show?
PJ Masks is one of our, my kids,
shows that they really like.
We are working on potty training still
and we have cabin fever.
We have cabin fever.
I think the kids need
to get out of the house.
I need to get out of the
house and breathe some cold,
crisp air.
So we're just gonna play for the morning
and then I think we're
gonna take a little break
from potty training for a few hours.
And just get out of the house.
I do like winters, I
like being in the house.
I like doing puzzles with the kids.
I like our quiet days.
We have a lot of quiet days in the winter.
Just lounging around the house.
And I think just with the
stresses of potty training
we're all like itching to get out.
So it's gonna feel good to go outside.
I wanna know who picked
up the cookie and thought
they could eat it.
Who's teeth marks are those?
- Mine.
- Did you eat it one time?
Thinking it was a cookie?
We have moved our party upstairs.
Kids are over there playing with Play-Doh.
And tonight, last night Jared made dinner.
And for so long, I've
wanted to get a babysitter
and go to Salt Lake.
And just go like a really fancy restaurant
and dress up, like that just
sounds like a really fun day.
But we're not doing that right now.
So I'm going to make us
a really yummy dinner.
And very rarely do I make like,
a three course meal, like it's just like,
okay, it's roast potatoes and
here's a cookie for dessert
and that's dinner.
Something that just like a
meal, and then that's it.
Like I don't make like a dessert
or like a salad or anything.
So, tonight I am going to do that.
I'm gonna make a salad,
I'm making a dessert,
I found a really super easy sorbet
and I just need to figure
out what kind of meal
I wanna make.
It's probably gonna be
something I've never made before
because I want it to be
like really fancy. So.
Yeah I'm just on Pintrest right now,
just looking up a bunch of things.
I'm so proud of you.
- Thank mom.
- You're welcome.
Honey you did so good.
He's like, stop talking
and give me my juice now.
Here you go.
He was asking for more
juice and I was like,
oh he hasn't gone potty all morning.
I was like go potty and
I'll give you juice,
and he went potty.
Been a day and a half
of no accidents, guys.
And lately he's been
saying thanks mom a lot.
Like, I think he definitely
picks it up from Jackson.
And he says sorry.
Like today, little hot mess this morning,
and he goes sorry mom.
And I'm like, its fine.
But don't do that again.
Anyway, no accidents for
a day and a half so far.
I think things are setting in.
And I'm just so excited.
And I'm really excited
just to make dinner.
I'm already hungry and it's lunch.
Can we just skip the day and
just go straight to dinner?
Anyone?
-  Hey bud. Do you
wanna go down the hill?
- No.
- No. (laughing) yeah okay.
Woo!
Yeah Jackson!
- Hey guys we're going. Whee! I did it!
- All right mamma, it's our turn.
We gotta show the boys how to do sledding.
- Okay.
- You hop in front.
- This sled is a fast one.
- Ready?
Set. Go! Woo!
(yelling)
Yeah!
- How many ugly faces did I just pull?
Calvin. Will you go speed down the hill?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Woo!
- Wee!
- Should I go down the slide you guys did?
I might be too big.
Here we go.
Woo!
Go.
Sliding into your DMs like.
That didn't work.
I guess I'm not sliding into your DMs.
- Okay now hold me tight.
Are you my baby?
- Yeah.
- Did you hear that? Are you my baby?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Okay. We're gonna go first.
No one's been down this one.
Crystal clear.
(yelling)
Woo!
- It feels good to be out here.
I'm so glad we're doing this.
Even Penny got a crazy workout.
There was another, a Labrador
retriever that is here.
And Penny was playing so
much with her friend, so.
This has been a good day for everybody.
- Oh my gosh, okay, I am rushing
to the hospital right now.
This is crazy.
I was getting the kids
ready in the bathtub
while Ellie was grocery
shopping for dinner tonight.
And we got a phone call
saying that we needed
to rush to the hospital because Cody
is going to the hospital right now.
Being rushed to the hospital
because he split his head open.
So we are running to
the hospital right now
to make sure everything's okay,
and to take care of Cody.
Oh geez.
You doing okay, bud?
You hanging in there?
You're tough, aren't ya?
Does it hurt right now?
- No.
- Good.
Good, the doctors are gonna
take good care of you,
Okay buddy?
So looks like Cody will need stitches.
They were looking to see
if they could glue it,
but it's just open a little too much.
So they're gonna stitch it up,
and then we'll go home. K?
And maybe just to make
things feel even better,
we'll grab some like
ice cream or something.
Would you like that?
- Mhm.
- Okay good.
Cody you look like Michelangelo
from the Ninja Turtles.
Is he your favorite Ninja Turtle?
- Yeah I like the blue one but.
- Leonardo?
- Yeah. And the orange
one because he's silly.
- Yeah he's pretty funny, huh?
- Hey buddy!
- Hey!
Hey how's it going?
- Aw, is he okay?
- Yeah.
- Look at that big old smile on his face.
Are you okay buddy?
- Yeah.
- I am so glad that Uncle Jared is taking
the best care of you.
- Mommy?
- Yeah?
- I was sledding at Bree's house
and I was going a little fast.
That I crashed into the deck.
-  Okay, how do you feel?
- Good.
-  Yeah, was that bad or was it good?
- It was good.
-  Yeah was it worse
or better than you thought?
- Better.
-  Good, hey I'm glad to hear that.
You are so tough.
- Is that a giant shot?
-  No. Wouldn't
that be kind of scary?
Now that's just to measure
oxygen and different things.
- What's that for?
-  That is to hang things like an IV,
and saline solution, and
those kind of things.
- What are ... is a IV thingy?
-  That is where they,
I'm not exactly sure
everything about an IV.
But we should look it up
and then we can find out the answer.
You did good, I'm proud of you, Bud.
You did awesome.
You're like a good example of what to do
when you gotta be tough.
- It's a little tight though.
-  Yeah, it will feel a little tight.
It will feel a little sore.
But you'll be good.
Good job buddy.
Oh look, here we are.
Good job, Bud.
Well I guess all in all,
Cody is pretty happy and
he's doing pretty good.
I was scared at first.
It's not always fun to
get a call like that.
But I'm glad I could be here,
and I'm glad you're doing great.
You doing good?
You're so into the game.
Come on, Cody.
- Hi Cody.
- Whoa.
- Yep we stitched it.
-  He's so proud of himself.
- He's like I got something cool.
-  Yeah.
You were so tough, huh?
What do you think, is that cool?
- Yeah I think that's so cool.
And guess what, it's his first time.
- Yeah, he was telling me,
he's like yeah, my sister got stitches,
my brother got stitches, my
other brother got stitches.
Yeah my mom and dad have stitches.
And now you finally joined the club.
K, you have a good night, buddy, okay?
- Thank you.
-  Thanks guys. We'll see ya.
- Well that was quite the change of plans.
- You just wanted to get out of dinner.
- Well I just didn't, I mean,
I kind of screwed it up yesterday,
so I figured this would be a good way.
Ellie this looks so cute.
-  Thanks.
- This looks great.
Did you get those flowers today, too?
- Yes.
- Aw.
- So happy Valentine's Day to you,
now I don't have to cook.
- Hey, there's no pre-celebration here.
It's not even February.
- Um this is just fun
for me to do tonight.
- Yeah, this is great.
- It's been a fun day.
- Yeah.
- Minus Cody's incident.
- I know, I feel bad, but honestly,
like knowing that he's
A OK and he feels good.
He was so excited to show Boss and Olivia.
He stood there was like, I got stitches.
Yeah, like he really really was.
So it was scary at first,
but now everything's good.
(guitar music)
- The kids are in bed,
and I got Jared and I
a little treat.
So we can watch a movie.
So thank you guys so much for watching.
I hope you guys are
having an awesome weekend,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
