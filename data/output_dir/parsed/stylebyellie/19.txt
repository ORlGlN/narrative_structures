(cheering)
- I said, sir!
(laughing)
- Hi! What were you doing back there?
- You may sound a little boring,
but you're not like Arie.
Mister, Mister Clark. You
love to get yourself dressed.
- Yeah.
- And you know what, I think
he does pretty dang good job
getting himself dressed.
This morning he's like,
"I want you to feed me."
And I thought for a second,
I'm like I haven't fed you
in forever, so sure I'll feed you.
My little Jackson that's getting so big.
Are you gonna have fun at school?
What do you think you'll
do at school today?
- I don't know.
- Maybe paint? What's your
favorite thing to do at school?
- Play with toys.
- Play with toys. Yeah.
- And my friends are Ryker and Tiger.
- Oh, cool!
You think Ryker and Tiger are twins?
- Yeah.
- Is he name Tiger?
- Tiger and Ryker.
- Oh. That's cool.
- Alright are you guys ready to do this?
- Yeah!
- We're ready!
- Let's go!
Can we take your truck? Is that okay?
- Si, senior.
(laughing)
- Oh, yes! High five.
- It has been many many months
since we have had to do that.
Thank you for pulling over.
My stomach is, I feel like
I'm starting to get Braxton
contractions. I had one the other day,
and I literally was like, I just sat down.
It was the weirdest thing.
- Oh my gosh.
- And I had to breathe, like
my stomach was so tight.
Maybe that's it?
Cause my stomach is
like so tight right now.
But I feel sick as a dog.
So we stopped and I
got a drink, Cheez-Its,
beef sticks and a banana.
I feel so, just like, sick.
So thanks for pulling over.
Bonnie's like, Ellie are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm like
(laughing)
- Am I filming you or window?
- The window.
I was like we have to pull
over and get you something
if you are sick, because we
have a time we're supposed to
be there at a certain time,
but they can wait a minute
so that you're not sick.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
- We have hundreds of orders,
and we want to be here
to fill them and sign them
and ship them on their way.
- We came down to the warehouse
where all of our products.
-  Yay!
- It's like look at this,
look, look at this dress,
look at the stitching.
-  Our BOLLIE logo.
- Isn't this absolutely
incredible and beautiful?
-  I love it!
-  In the masses.
-  Yes. We have our robes.
We are getting ready to ship stuff out.
- Oh my gosh, like this is such
a surreal feeling right now.
So, if you guys made the
first, if you're one of the few
hundreds of people who made
orders, you'll probably get,
like a little signature
from us, like how exciting.
If you do get one, let us know!
We've got pop sockets,
leggings, dresses, robes, bras.
Isn't this cool?
-  I cannot believe it.
- That blows my mind.
- I can't wait to do this!
- K! Enough yappin', let's
get to work and start packin'.
(gasp)
- Oh!
- Oh!
(laughing)
- Yasmine, we got your order comin'.
Yes!
Do we have more pens? Here, hand me a pen.
Packed by Jared!
(laughing)
Woo! Here we go.
- K, Veronica, you're package
is packed and ready to go,
and I even double checked
everything, so I didn't screw up.
- Lacy, hey!
- Pregnant Ellie here.
I'm just telling Jared what to do.
Jared, envelope.
Jared, small robe.
Perfect.
- Jordan, I hope this robe
gives you as much love
as I'm giving it now.
(laughing)
Enjoy.
- Jared, stuff.
Jared, slip.
Jared, seal.
(package crinkling)
Slap that label.
I'm so good at packaging.
(upbeat music)
Guess who's order I just picked up!
-  Who's?
- Guess!
- Mom's?
- Julie's?
- Jennifer Griffith!
(cheering)
- Woo! Mom!
Thanks mom.
- Hashtag BOLLIE.
- Let's hand deliver mom's package to her.
- Yes!
(cheering)
- Okay, I'll go get the stuff.
- You're a good son-in-law.
- Maybe she'll have lunch for us.
(laughing)
- Alight, mom's all
packaged and ready to go.
- So cute.
- Aw!
- Isn't this fun?
- She's gonna die.
- (signing) Hand, sealed, delivered,
-  I'm yours.
- I swear the times I laugh
the hardest is just moments
like this where we are
walking, just to the car.
(laughing)
Like the time that Bonnie was
like, "Oh, excuse me, sir."
And he didn't say anything
cause we walked by him
and it was like years ago.
- I said, "Sir!"
- And he didn't turn around
and she was like, "Sir!"
like pretended to kick
him, we just, we died!
Like the funniest things
I ever laughed about
is just when we're walking to the car.
Well that was a wrap up of the warehouse.
We had to so much fun.
But we have one deliver
that we need to make.
Mom's.
- Hand delivery.
-  No way! I just barely saw this.
-  Special delivery!
- Oh my gosh! No way!
-  Mom, what are you working on?
- Well, I've been working hard.
-  You have your office all set up.
- This is my office, I'm
gonna need a new chair.
(laughing)
-  Here, give momma her packages.
- What would you like to open first?
- Oh, the robe.
-  Ahh.
-  Yay!
- Oh! What's this? Oh this is the um,
-  Phone case.
-  Now, what size
of phone do you have?
- I have a great, big phone.
(laughing)
- So she ordered the wrong
phone case for her phone.
-  She ordered
the wrong phone case.
(Ellie laughing)
- And we were there, we were
going to bring you right one.
-  That's okay.
- Oh my gosh, we'll take it back for you.
-  That's not
a BOLLIE shipping problem.
- Why am I so nervous? I'm like, oh!
- Because you're on camera.
There's a little thing there.
It's okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Now wait a minute.
Did you only order one?
- I ordered one for,
-  And you sent it someone else.
- Yes, I sent it to someone,
- Okay I was like did we mess that up?
Okay.
- I ordered on for my sister!
-  Oh you're so cute.
- Yes, it's her birthday next
week, so I got her one too.
-  Yay!
- Oh this, this is so
cool. This is so cool.
-  It's so cute on you.
-  You look beautiful!
-  Oh this is cute!
I love the fabric.
I love it.
-  You look so cute.
Mom, thanks for supporting us!
- I have been waitin'. Like,
I knew these were comin'.
So, I didn't buy a robe
since, like October.
-  Oh my gosh.
- I wanted one for
Christmas and I'm like, no
I'm not gonna do it.
-  It's so cute on you. I love it.
-  I love it.
-  Cute, mom.
-  Is it comfy?
- Yes! Got a place here for my
phone, and it won't fall out.
I like that. I like the
length of the sleeves,
I like the feel, I like the stretch.
-  We are not making mom say this.
(laughing)
Cute!
(child yelling)
(laughing)
-  Oh!
-  Hi, what were
you doing back there?
-  We were playing hide-and-seek.
-  Oh, fun!
Hi, Cal. Hi, mom. Hi, Jack.
-  Hi.
-  Come give me hugs.
-  Were you playing hide-and-seek?
-  Hey, Cal. Come give me hugs.
Oh, I missed you. Muah.
Were you shakin' and movin' and groovin'?
Show me your dance moves.
Yeah, boys!
Look at grandma, what
grandma's teachin' ya.
-  Oh that's not from grandma.
(laughing)
-  Hey, dad.
-  Hey.
- Um, doing orders was so fun.
-  Yes it was.
-  Was it? Oh, good.
- Yes it was.
-  Yes it was so sweet.
-  Oh good.
- Give grandma a kisses goodbye, Cal.
-  Aww.
-  Can you come watch
sharks? Watch it another day.
-  Calvin, blow grandma a kiss.
Aww. Can you blow her a kiss?
-  Can you do this?
(laughing)
-  He just did it like five times.
Calvin like this. Like
this, like this, like this,
like this.
Yeah there you go.
-  Can I see it?
-  Bye, guys.
-  When was the last time
you gave your kid a piggy-back ride?
I was wiping up the
floor and Calvin came and
jumped on my back.
Did you like that, Cal?
-  I do again.
- You want me to do it again?
Oh!
I have not given my kids a
piggy-back ride in forever.
It's little things like that
and picking your kids up
and holding them, like this
morning when Jackson's like,
"I want you to feed me",
I'm like, "that's crazy",
I was like, "but, okay!"
Because he's my little
toddler, and I have not
fed him in forever, and I was like,
-  (jabbering)
- And it was such a cute
moment, just like putting
him on the counter,
-  This is my dog. Woof!
- Talking to him,
-  I want you to do it again.
- I'm not doing it
again I'm out of breath.
My stomach, all day, I thought
it was just for a minute
it would hurt, but my stomach,
I have noticed a lot of changes today,
like I'm just out of breath, well,
obviously because I'm getting chocked,
but I'm just out of breath a lot,
and just pregnancy and growing.
It's just crazy what
baby's doing in there.
He's grown', and I can feel you.
-  (jabbering)
- What?
-  I want to do it again.
- Last time,
last time.
(heavy breathing and laughing)
-  Alright, I
may have just found the
best crepe recipe. I love crepes.
And tonight and I wanted
to do a simple dinner.
I found this girl on
Pinterest, TheLittleBroken.com
is her name.
But, I've made crepes before
but this is my favorite.
It's two large eggs, a cup
of milk, half cup water,
one cup flour, two tablespoons butter,
one to two tablespoons honey, um,
a teaspoon vanilla and pinch of salt.
You mix it, refrigerate it.
And like they're the best
crepes I've ever made.
Super thin.
Jared's actually resting right now,
he woke up this morning
with a super bad cold,
so I'm saving those for Jared.
I'm going to eat mine, the
kids already ate theirs
and like ran off, so I'm
gonna sit by myself and
enjoy some dinner.
Oh, hi miss pretty girl.
Hi, miss pretty girl.
How are you?
You know what I was
thinking of the other night.
It's going to be so fun and the baby comes
and we put the kids in
bed but it's just like me,
the baby, and Jared, but then
like Penny time, ya know?
Like I'm excited to see
how Penny is with the baby.
It's just going to be
exciting, there's going to be
a lot of changes that I'm
like looking forward to.
You wanna know what Jackson
said in his prayer tonight?
-  What did he say?
- He said, usually, it's like,
"no help me say the prayer",
no, he said it all on
his own, and he said,
"please help us be nice to each other",
-  Aww
- and then he said "and
let me see me cousins."
(laughing)
Amen.
(laughing)
-  That's real sweet.
- It was so funny.
That was his prayer, to see his cousins,
Huh, Pen.
He loves them
- Can the studio audience
please give Ellie
a round of applause?
- Whaaaaat!
- Thank you very much
studio audience for that.
I don't know what has really
happened for the past couple
hours, um, but I just know
that Ellie has taken care
of everything for the time
because I wasn't there,
I don't know where I was.
- You may sound a little boring
but you're not like Arie.
That was an interesting
ending to The Bachelor
- Yes, it was.
- If anybody watched.
- It was very, like, boring.
- Yeah, I feel like I'm
kind of in the space
between dream and reality,
so I don't know what's real
and I don't know what's fake,
but I think I watched The
Bachelor and they had a horse.
- That was like the last two seconds.
- So, here's the deal, I'm
gonna try to pull it together
and get some work done
before the night ends
before I go back to bed,
but thank you guys so much for watching,
it was so much fun to go
to the warehouse today
and pack a bunch of those orders
and write you a bunch of notes.
Thank you so much for the
support, for everything.
Ugh, crossing my fingers
this doesn't last long,
I don't normally get sick
but I think when I do,
it like okay, you're sick,
so hopefully I get better,
hopefully I can put word together,
I'm having a hard time right now guys,
and I know this is so
disastrous for you to watch
so I'm going to end it here.
Thank you for watching and
we will see you next time.
Bye.
(snoring)
