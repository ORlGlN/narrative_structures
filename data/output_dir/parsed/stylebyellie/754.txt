what our yard may look like and it's
very very cool and we're really excited

what we like about it and everything
this is kind of just a rough draft of
what we might do and it just kind of
looks fun it's it's we told them what we
wanted and he kind of drew it out for us
and and that's I think that was the
biggest thing is we at we know what we
want but we don't necessarily know how
to implement that into the yard and this

paper can come too far life oh you did
