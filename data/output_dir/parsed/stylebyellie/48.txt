- Singing at a funeral
is a difficult thing,
even though I've only done it one time.
I just get emotional thinking about it.
-  Hey, Mr. Dance Man let's go.
- She said, "I have watched
Ellie and Jared every day
"for four years."
- Oh my gosh.
- What do you have to say
for yourself about this?
And this? And this?
(dramatic music)
Good morning guys, I hope
you're having a great day.
Today we're kind of starting
off on a sad, solemn note.
Someone from our
neighborhood has passed away,
a very unfortunate thing.
And you're probably wondering
why I am dressed up like that,
it's because the funeral is today
and they've asked me
to sing at the funeral.
And I am very happy to be a part of this,
but it's also a very, very sad thing.
I've only sang at one
funeral before in my life,
and it was my Grandpa's.
Just get emotional thinking about it.
Singing at a funeral is a difficult thing
even though I've only done it one time.
My dad is a very, very talented singer,
much more talented than I am,
and he has sung at a lot of funerals
because we were in Spokane
everyone knew my dad
was an incredible singer,
and a lot of people asked
him to sing at their funerals
before they even passed away.
So we talked a little bit yesterday about
getting your mind and your
heart in the right place
to sing at a funeral.
Like I said, I'm honored that
someone would think of me
to sing at their funeral,
but it's still a very
hard and difficult thing,
but that's why I'm dressed up
in my suit today on a Thursday;
I am going to sing at a funeral today.
Ellie and I believe that
the end of this life isn't the end.
So funeral for us aren't
always the saddest thing.
I think that's pretty special
and it makes funerals
feel a little different
than what most people are accustomed to.
They're not always just sad.
It's kind of peaceful.
And I'm hoping that we have
a very peaceful day today.
- There are two kind of sippy
cups that I really like.
These are Re-Play sippy cups.
I get them, you can get them online,
or like C-A-L Ranch, like a country store.
And the Nalgene bottles.
These are probably my absolutely favorite.
They're Nalgene sippy cups.
I've posted an Instagram picture.
A lot of people wanted to
know what sippy cups we use.
The Nalgene one is my favorite.
I'm getting the boys a drink.
Jackson's going getting the
kids a little lunch prepared
because we're gonna get in the
car and drive to Target today.
We're just gonna hang out
at Target for a few hours
because it's an hour away,
we're gonna go look around
at some baby stuff and just hang out.
I just got back from the
chiropractor appointment
and I always feel much better when I go,
so feelin' really good,
we're gonna get out
of the house for a little bit,
gotta make the kids a lunch.
This happens to me every
single time I go out shopping.
Usually when I'm with the
kids and out shopping,
I know I'm not gonna get much done,
'cause it's more of us just
getting out of the house,
walking around the store,
they love to look at the toys,
but I'm making a list because I
get overwhelmed when I go into stores,
and especially with the kids.
Like, I forget what I need.
So I'm writing down that I'm looking for
bins for the closet for Jared and I,
I'm looking at stuff for
the mantel downstairs,
and I'm looking at maternity stuff.
And then I wrote down
how old the baby will be
for these months, because
I'm hoping to find,
'cause it's kinda toward
the end of winter,
I'm hoping to find like
a winter snow outfit
for like a three to six
or six to nine month old.
I don't know what one to get,
because he'll be six to nine
months November to January,
but he'll probably be
small like these dudes.
And I could get away with three to six.
I don't know, but I'm
hoping to find like a
like a winter snow outfit
for the baby for next year,
so it covers his feet up
to his hands, you know?
We'll see what they've got,
it'll just be fun to look around,
but I do try and make a list especially
when I go to Target because
then I end up just like,
getting overwhelmed.
Before Jared goes, he's
measuring everything for me.
He's been so good.
He's measuring all of this
because I'm thinking maybe,
this summer it might be nice
to even have shades outside.
But who knows, that might not happen,
'cause it's taken us a year
to get shades right here.
(laughing)
Did you draw me a picture?
I love that!
Right on my list.
(laughing)
That looks great!
And did you make a mess?
(agreeing)
Okay, let's go get Jackson.
Bye dad!
- Bye dad!
-  By now!
-  Got your crackers?
Where are they?
(laughing)
Got the kids lunch, got
Calvin's potty, my wallet.
What did you find?
- Binky.
-  Wow!
Should we get those for Calvin?
- No.
(laughing)
-  That's a joke.
Jackson, did you make this at school?
-  I did.
- You did, good job!
K, we found Jackson some
(gasping) rain boots,
and you can wear Jackson's
yellow ones from last year.
Look how cute Target's baby clothes are!
Look how cute those jammy's.
That is so cute!
Wow, that's so fun.
- Bink!
-  Did you find the binky's?
Wow!
(upbeat music)
Okay Mr. Dance Man, let's go!
(laughing)
Who doesn't love a dance party in Target?
Oh, and he's done, he's out.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
- Okay.
- So I just got back from the funeral.
And, funerals are, it's such
a interesting thing to go to.
I like going to funerals because it's,
it puts life into perspective.
And it makes you think
about who you interact with,
and why you interact with them,
and what you do together.
People are important.
- Yes.
- Family is important.
- As much as sometimes
you can't stand them.
- Yeah, it's true.
- It's true that
- I wanna say it.
- The end is important
- yeah!
- But sometimes you get--
- Sometimes you get in
arguments with your brothers.
But then you realize those
little things just don't matter.
And family matters.
I wanted to tell a story about the funeral
and me singing at the funeral.
And, it goes back a couple days.
I got a text message from
someone in our church
asking if I would sing at the funeral.
And of course I said
yes, and my thought was,
like oh I'm in the
primary, doing the music,
and I'm now in the church
choir, so maybe that's why.
So I'm thinkin' it's about, you know,
I'm kinda showing people
that I am okay with singing,
and I have this calling where
teach music to the kids,
and I think that's why they asked me.
I get to the church today, because,
we practiced a little bit before we sang.
And one of the ladies came up to me
and she said, thank you
so much for doing this.
I wanted to tell you the
story about the lady,
and she said, I visited with
her the day before she passed.
And we were just talking
about things that we love
about life and things that we cherish,
and things that make us laugh,
and she asked her, she said,
do you ever just watch,
get on YouTube and
watch these funny videos
that just make you laugh and smile?
And she said, I have watched Ellie
and Jared every day for four years.
- Oh my gosh!
- And I had no idea about this.
She said I've, me and my daughter,
we watch Ellie and Jared every single day.
And I just broke down right there.
Because I had no idea.
I mean I've seen her in
church and everything,
but she never said anything to us.
She never mentioned anything to us,
and I just can't help but think,
I wish I would have known.
- You know?
- Yeah.
- Maybe I would have
done something different.
Maybe we would have talked more,
maybe we would have, you know,
caught more smiles at
each other in the hallway.
You know, I remembered, you know,
the kids waving and stuff like that,
but I just can't help but think
if I wish, if I would have known,
what would I have done differently?
And it just made singing at the
funeral so much more special,
that I got to be a part of that.
And it just made, it just
was more meaningful to me.
And I'm glad that I had an opportunity to,
that we had an opportunity
to play a part in her life.
Especially with her daughter.
And I'm just grateful.
Like I said, funerals just
put things into perspective.
For example, you never
know who's watching.
Vlogs are not, this is not about, like,
YouTube and everything, but it's just that
you never know who's
looking and watching you,
for your example.
And it just makes me realize, like,
I want to be that much better of a person.
Because, you know, we all have bad days.
- No, totally.
- We all have,
- you know, so we get mad at our kids and,
but, it just makes me want to
be just a little bit better,
because I never know
who exactly is watching.
And it makes me wanna take
this platform that we have.
- Be the better, bigger person.
- Yeah, and use it for good.
And I hope that we are
doing the best that we can
to use this for good.
And, my heart and prayers are
with the family right now.
And--
- Absolutely.
- It's a hard time and,
- It turned into something
- That's wonderful.
- Absolutely I would do,
but then it just turned more special.
And, I'm grateful for this,
and I'm grateful for life.
And the other thing about
the funeral is you learn
so much about someone that
you never knew before.
And it's just like, I wish
I would have taken more time
to interact more and,
so I guess that's my message
about this whole thing,
is let's take time to
be with each other more.
To learn more about our
neighbors and friends.
And to be kind to each other.

- And this, and this?
(dramatic music)
And this, huh?
What do you have to say for yourself?
This is a mess, and we
need to clean it up.
K, here's the agenda for
the rest of the evening.
We are going to clean this mess up.
We are going to clean you

How does that sound?
- Good.

Good job.

Going along for the ride?

-  I just had a
little flip out moment,
I like have anxiety with,
'cause he's like, you
don't wanna rip the sore.
I have anxiety about this.
-  I'm just tryin'
to get these outer edges.
Okay, here it comes.
- Ellie!
- Is it sore?
-  Yeah.
It looks really sore, I feel so bad.
It is, from the top of
my finger, to my knuckle.
(moaning)
That's big, Ellie!
(laughing)
Aw.
- I'm gonna end the vlog
for the night, guys.
So we just showed you Jared
removing my bandage on my back.
If you feel like you have any spots
that you wanna get checked out,
now is the time to go to the doctor.
You're not too young to go and
just have a thorough look over.
I'm so glad that I went in
and had this checked out.
Who knows what would
have happened if I waited
even like a few more years.
It's just crazy, life can be so crazy.
So thank you guys so much
for watching our vlog,
not just today, but every day.
I hope you guys find something
fun to do this weekend.
I know Jared and I have some fun plans.
So, we'll see you guys tomorrow, bye.
