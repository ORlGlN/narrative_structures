(bright music)
- Shhh, oh.
- Dad!
- What?
- I can't even see anything.
- I know why you wanted to come over.
Good morning guys, we had a very pleasant
surprise this morning.
Jackson came up to me and he said Dad,
I want to do something today
and what do you want to do young man?
- I want to go to Grandma
and Grandpa Mecham's house.
- You want to go to Grandma
and Grandpa Mecham's house?
Well I think that's a fun idea.
It was the sweetest thing ever.
He came up to me while I
was working in the office
and he was like, Dad, will you please
take me to Grandma and
Grandpa Mecham's house
so I can have a spicy drink?
They have like this fruit juice
that has carbonation in it
or something like that,
like V8 Splash or something that he loves.
I want to go over there
and have a spicy drink
and cuddle with Grandma and Grandpa.
And I was like that's
the sweetest thing ever.
Do you know you're the sweetest
thing ever Jackson?
- Yeah.
-  So what did we do?
Did we ask Grandma and Grandpa?
- Yeah.
-  How did we ask them?
- We Facetimed them.
-  Yeah we Facetimed
them and what did they say?
- Yes.
- They said yes.
And so we are going to drop Jackson off
at Grandma and Grandpa's house,
so he can have a spicy drink
and cuddle with Grandma and Grandpa.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go young man, are you ready?
Okay.
- Yeah.
- And the shoes.
- Thank you, you are so sweet.
He's been so patient, yet not quite
so patient, because he's
been asking every second,
it's like are you ready yet Dad?
Can I help you with anything?
Can I get your shoes?
Let's go.
He's so anxious to go and I love it.
(Jared laughs)
I know why you wanted to come over.
Hey, you have fun with
Grandma and Grandpa, okay?
- Okay.
- He just, he knew what he wanted to do
when he woke up today.
And that was come over to
your house and hang out like,
you guys must be pretty cool or something.
- We love it.
- Hey, what's happening?
-  Is she moving the bed for you?
- Hey.
- Okay bye buddy, have fun.
- Bye.
-  Love you.
- Love you.
- This is a great Christmas song.
- Oh yeah,

tunes going right now guys.
We got the Christmas tunes.
Are you feelin' it Calvin?
You feelin' it Penny?
Yeah, come here.
Good girl.
Oh yeah, feelin' the Christmas tunes,
that's for sure.
That's a good girl.
- Calvin and I were so hopping,
we totally dropped one of those.
-  Oh is that what happened?
- Yep, we were dancing.
- Well when I came in, it was the--
♪ This Christmas, ♪
whatever that song is called
and Ellie and I just started like,
we just started thumping and dancing.
- Busting it out.
- Bouncin'.
- We were busting it out
and having a good time.
Weren't we Penny?
Yeah we were, huh?
Okay show me Penny, Penny show me,
can you get in your place?
Good girl, that's a good girl,
and right into a default down position,
that's great!
(bright festive music)
(laughing)
- Are you gonna help me film?
Are you gonna help me?
Are you gonna help me?
- No.
- No.
- Don't.
- We are feeling the
Christmas spirit today.
I got my red lips on,
(festive music)
we have some Christmas music on.
It's very soft,
and Jared and I just got
done filming a little bit
of my pregnancy update.
I wanted to find a cute way
that I wanted to do the pregnancy updates
and I hope that you guys
like it and think it's cute.
- And that involves
smelly gross boiled eggs.
- It's good.
- Blech.
- It may taste good,
but the smell of it is just nasty to me,
I don't know how people like it.
- I don't think it's bad.
Do you like scrambled eggs?
- I love scrambled eggs.
I love eggs, but not hard boiled eggs.
- Same thing, take a
fork and mash these up.

Yay Mom victory,
I'm trying to be quiet.
'Cause I don't want to bug
him or him be like, Mama.
'Cause he's in the mode.
Calvin is going to the bathroom.
Just a teeny update with potty training.
I haven't like full force,
been like we're doing it and the diapers
are out of the house.
And that's probably
the way I should do it.
I don't know, there's probably
a hundred people that think
I'm doing it way wrong,
but we're easing into it,
but Calvin is going potty
and I'm so proud of him.
But I definitely felt like
I should just have him
sit on the potty and I was like,
okay, I'm gonna go get you your prize
for when you go.
And I left, and I haven't come back
and I know he's still going
and I'm so proud of him.
(Ellie laughs)
She looks sad.
She came out of there so slow.
- Oh 'cause she was asleep.
- Hi.
- I was playing her to sleep.
- Aww.
- Shh, Oh.
- Dad!
-  Dad, did the poo.
- Did you go poo?
-  Yeah.
- You did?
So our neighborhood is doing
a little Christmas party
get together tonight,
and they have asked me to play the guitar.
Every time I get the camera out,
Penny goes like a little crazy.
Hey, that's my hat.
They have asked me to play guitar
at this get together,
and so I was like, okay I've
got to practice a little bit.
I've got to get some things going,
because it's been awhile
since I played guitar
in front of people
and frankly I'm a little nervous.
But I needed the amp,
because I guess there's gonna be
about 90 to a hundred people there
and I plugged in my amp,
and the battery is dead
on my acoustic guitar,
so we're gonna have to run to the store
to get a battery Ellie.
We gotta run to the store.
-  Can you guys see the fog?
- What?
- I can't even see anything.
-  I can't see anything.
- It is so foggy.
When Jared edits, which
is 99.9% of the time,
Penny lays at his feet.
When I'm editing--
-  She's right there by your feet.
- I'm actually gonna edit
the next two days' vlogs,
-  While I work on something else.
- We'll see how I can
make it, it's midnight,
because Jared has some
work that he's gonna do.
And I'm like well, that way
he's not up 'til like four.
How about I take half the work?
- Taking some of the
load off my shoulders,
I love it.
- We're gonna do teamwork.
-  Teamwork makes the dream work.
- Until I fall asleep.
- Frankly I'm surprised you're still awake
as it is,
- I know.
It's nearly midnight.
It's six minutes until midnight.
Here's the deal yo.
So we had our little neighborhood
Christmas party today
and I played the guitar
and I did terrible.
Like I really really did bad,
I messed up a lot.
- You messed up but it was jokey,
- Yeah it was fine.
- it was fun.
- But I need to redeem myself,
so I'd like to play a portion
of the song for you right now.
So get comfortable, put
your listening ears on,
close your eyes and enjoy the music.
("Silent Night")
-  He acts cocky
when he's in his own house.
He didn't act like this tonight.
(Ellie laughs)
Oh my, I think you're
just playing it thick.
("Angels We Have Heard on High")
Are you really concentrating?
- Yeah.
Now I'm not.
-  I was like,
is he trying to poop?
Cute puppy.
("The Little Drummer Boy")
When Jared was playing this tonight,
it was at the church, our friends had it
at the church tonight,
and Jackson had a cookie and went up Jared
at the very end and waited
for him to take a bite,
and then at the end,
Jared took a big ole bite of the cookie
and everyone laughed,
because he was just like waiting for Dad
to take a bite of the cookie.
And when you started this,
and he goes, bum bum.
'Cause it's the Rum pa bum song, you know,
the Drummer Boy,
and he laughed.
That it is from us to you.
We'll see you tomorrow, bye.
-  Bye buddy,
hope you find your dad.
-  Goodnight pretty girl.
I didn't mean to wake you up.
Goodnight.
-  Goodnight sweet prince.
-  Gosh, she's so sensitive.
When you walked out of the door,
you should've seen her face.
- Oh, as soon as I get up to leave,
she is right by my side.
- And I was I here,
and I was like Penny it's okay, just wait.
And I was in here and I waas like,
Penny, it's okay, just wait.
And Jared went into the garage,
you could hear all this ruckus,
and she was like,
and then she darted from my hand out,
'cause she just wanted to be in the action
or wanted to know what was going on.
- She follows me wherever
I go in the house
and it's sweet.
-  It is very cute.
But this is like the fourth time
she's fallen asleep and I don't
want to bug her, goodnight.
- Okay, thank you for watching, bye.
