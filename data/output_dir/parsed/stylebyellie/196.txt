- Sometimes you just have so much fun
in a day or a week that you just pass out
and take a nap whenever you are.
His arm is up in the air.
That's so cute.
Oh, shh, quiet, quiet, quiet.
How cute is he?
Goodnight.
(cheerful music)
Good morning family.
- At the aquarium.
- We are at the aquarium
that is exactly right.
And guess what?
There's like no one here.
Do you guys remember how filled that was?
-  Did you show that?
-  Yeah, it was so busy.
And the parking lot is completely empty
and we're gonna have a blast.
- There is gonna be a big fish in there.
Is there gonna be a big fish?
-  I think so.
- Jackson does not like
when we hold his hand.
For crossing the street or something.
I think it's 'cause he
wants his own independence.
And he's like, "No, I'll stand by you
"but I don't wanna hold your hand."
But he's really good
to hold Calvin's hand.
So sometimes we do it this way.
That way we're all together.
- Because this is the aquarium.
-  That's how I
feel on Mondays too, buddy.
That's how I feel on Mondays too.
- Ah, ah, he's got my hand, Jackson.
Help me, he's got my hand.
Ah, he's got it.
Thank you.
(loud thumping)
-  Oh!
- Oh geez.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Thanks for protecting me, Jackson?
Thanks for protecting me.
-  Is your hand okay?
Are you okay?
You know what?
You deserve some candy.
When we're done, we'll get
a treat at the gift shop.
- He just saved his dad.
-  Did you see that?
- And maybe bump into these teeth.
-  Oh heavens no.
-  No, this is hard as a rock.
- That was funny.
Wowzers, that escalated quickly.
So, we just walked into
this part of the aquarium
and it is beautiful.
And they have a ton of turtles.
Look at all of these cuties.
Holy moly guacamole.
Hi.
So we are in this room
where there are sea turtles
and this is a rehabilitation room
so they are helping these turtles.
And this one got hit by a boat.
And it tells you the name
of it and what happened.
And you can see his shell.
And she's just talking us about them.
(soft music)
Okay, our cousin came to play with us.
Everyone's grabbing a turtle.
-  Okay guys, bring
your turtles into recovery.
Yup, right in there.
Now real soft.
Good job.
Okay, put them in the water.
Nice.
Go ahead, Maggie.
Good.
Okay, it's time to release the turtles.
- I'm gonna do it again.
-  There you go, good job.
You just saved a turtle's life, Jackson.
- I'm gonna do it again.
-  I'll get them.
Look.
-  Do you see all those fish?
Is that so cool, Bud?
Are you counting 'em?
Look at how big this is.
-  This kind of crap blows my mind.
- Oh yeah.
- Totally.
Look at this.
-  Look, there's a shark.
-  That looks like a cartoon.
-  Wow!
What do you guys think of this?
- Look at that big shark.
-  That is so big.
They're so big.
Look how mean this one looks, Ellie.
Look at that one right there.
-  Oh yeah, that one looks angry.
-  He looks so mean.
-  Where's the scary guy?
(laughs)
Okay, I think we all had fun.
Ending it with trying to find shark teeth.
- It is our last day at the
beach and it is chilly outside.
But we're doing our best
to make the most of it, have some fun.
So we're gonna dig some holes
and put kids inside of them.
- Bury the children.
-  Bury the children.
Jump in!
Okay, bend down a little bit.
Bend down.
Okay, not that low.
There ya go, now we're gonna fill it in.
Stay there.
Bend down a little more.
Okay, now we're gonna put your arms under.
-  Where did your body go?
Oh no.
-  Hey Jackson.
You're stuck in the sand.
You're totally trapped.
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, Jackson.
Time to get out.
Wiggle yourself out.
Dig, dig, dig.
(laughs)
Yeah, he's free!
Yeah!
-  All right you beach boys.
- We got our big body boards.
-  Take your big body boards
and see how well you do.
- Yeah, surfer.
Whatever, boogie board.
(upbeat music)
- Oh Calvin.
Calvin.
He has taken his shorts off two times
and once down on the beach
yelling, "Bum, bum, bum, bum."
No!
That's gonna hurt.
- Okay get this.
Believe it or not, Ellie is with my sister
and brother-in-law and
they are at CrossFit.
My sister and brother-in-law
have been doing CrossFit
for awhile now and you guys
know that we've been trying
to work out and be better.
So Ellie went with them.
She's like, "You guys
have been going all week.
"I wanna go with you
and get my workout in."
So she went with them.
I stayed back because I
actually have a phone call,
a meeting that I have
to go to, be a part of,
in like one minute at three o'clock.
And it's three o'clock right now.
So I just thought that was worth noting
that Ellie is at CrossFit.
I know the internet has a different...
There's a stigma with CrossFit sometimes
but we're bettering our bodies.
And that's the goal, sometimes.
We're trying to do that
sometimes, I guess.
(upbeat music)
- So I just tried out CrossFit today
but I am balancing it out with a muffin.
- When I was talking
about the clip before,
I was like sometimes.
We're doing good balancing
everything sometimes.
- Oh yeah.
-  This is the sometimes.
- Oh yeah, it's a balance.
I workout and now I'm eating a muffin.
It was really fun.
I never done CrossFit.
Melanie over there, hi.
Melanie and her husband, they
do CrossFit all the time.
So Jenn and I went with them and did it.
And I worked out and it was awesome.
- Did you like it?
- Yeah, I didn't push myself though
'cause I didn't wanna be sick, you know?
- You wanted to get a good feel for it
and kinda see because we're
looking at different workouts.
We did the phone workout,
we did the Apple TV workout,
and we've gone to a couple gyms.
And now we're just trying CrossFit.
- I like doing it home 'cause
it's hard to leave your kids.
Anyway, but it was fun.
And I'm gonna finish my muffin.
- Hi Buddy.
Hi Buddy.
Oh, Ellie!
I miss...
The baby smell.
- I guess I haven't smelled
your cheeks, baby boy.
- Smell his head.
- You do.
- Do you miss that?
- Look at face, "Please stop smelling me."
- I just miss that so much.
That's one of the things that is so unique
is just that fresh baby smell.
You smell good little baby boy.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
- Hi.
Hi.
(clicking)
- Ooh, he liked that.
Huh?
Yeah.
He's looking at my hair, look at that.
Peter you looking at my hair?
Oh my gosh, would you look at that spider?
That is so big.
That's probably three inches
long, four inches long.
-  So creeped out.
- It's very windy out here.
So we all got kites to
fly kites in the wind.
You probably can't hear
anything we're saying.
- It's kinda scary
with all these streamers
blowing everywhere.
Come here.
- Let's fly a kite, Jackson.
- Jackson, Calvin!
- Calvin, come on, let's fly a kite.
(upbeat music)
Sometimes you just have so
much fun in a day or a week
that you just pass out and
take a nap whenever you are.
His arm is up in the air.
That's so cute.
Oh, shh, quiet, quiet, quiet.
How cute is he?
Goodnight.
(upbeat music)
To end our party, we are
having a glow stick party.
Everyone is upstairs
getting the glow sticks
that they want ready to go
and they're coming out here
to a pool and a hot tub.
Holy crap.
Oh my gosh, it's so windy and cold.
Oh my gosh, I have a
feeling everyone is going
to be in the hot tub.
Just like Ellie is.
Show me your glow stick.
(upbeat music)
Woo!
This is gonna be extra cold
because I just got out of the hot tub.
(screams)
(upbeat music)
Can you believe our trip is over?
- Yes.
- This is our last night here.
- We had so much fun.
- It was seriously a
blast every single day.
Every single night we went to bed
we were just completely exhausted
because of the day's
activities were so awesome.
- And we have 1,001 seashells
that we are bringing home.
- Literally like 15 cups.
- Jared said just save the ones.
- Just pick the best.
- And I said, no!
Jackson collected 90% of them.
- And also we're giving a
lot of them to Grandma Great
'cause she asked for them.
- Yeah.
- So we're going that.
But thank you guys for
watching for the video.
We have a long, long day
tomorrow of flying and traveling.
So thank you guys.
We will see you guys tomorrow.
-  Bye.
