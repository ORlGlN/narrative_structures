(upbeat instrumental music)
- Look, do you see 'em?
That is the biggest Care
Bear I have ever seen, Ellie.
(laughing)
-  Good morning guys.
We are watching the video
for the day, and Calvin,
you're getting dressed in my shirt!
That's mine!
- Today, we have the amazing
opportunity to help celebrate
Care Bear's 35th anniversary.
That is incredible, so
we're here in Los Angeles
and we're about ready to
go to this huge event.
And Care Bears have some
shirts for the kids,
and they have 'em on right now.
So, show me your shirt, bud.
Whoa!
Is that Tender Heart Bear?
- Mm hmm.
- Yeah.
This is such a throwback.
The color scheme and everything.
Like, I wasn't born in
1982, but it still makes me
feel nostalgic.
Don't show us your, we
wanna see your shirt
not your belly, silly boy.
Calvin, can we see your shirt?
Look at all those Care, not
your belly button silly.
Look at all these Care Bears.
- There's Grumpy Bear
-  Yeah.
- and there's Wonder Heart Bear,
-  Uh huh.
- and there's Rainbow Heart Bear,
-  Yeah.
- and there's uh, what bear is it?
-  Uh, I can't remember.
I think it was Secret Bear,
but we actually have Rainbow
Heart Bear right here.
- That's cute.
Hey,
- Wasn't that adorable?
- let's go!
- Let's go!
- Hey, you wanna go to Carealot?
- I don't know.
- You wanna go--
- (laughs) I wonder where
Jackson wants to go.
- You wanna go to Carealot?
- I think we're gonna try and
find Carealot today, guys.
(laughing)
-  Here's Grumpy Bear.
(laughing)
-  Switch their shirts.
♫ Boom boom boom
(laughing)
- Calvin, get out of the toilet.
Okay, I can get Calvin out
of the toilet a hundred times
a day.
- You have the sacred
opportunity to carry around
Rainbow Heart Bear.
We're taking Rainbow Heart Bear
wherever we go today, okay?
-  Okay.
-  That's our special guest.
-  Let's go.
- Daddy look.
-  I think you look pretty great.
Oh, there's our elevator.
Let's go push the button.
Not the emergency button, Calvin.
-  Yeah, not like last time.
- What button is it?
- Let's try the star with the L.
Boop.
Okay, we got a sleepy head already.
He is zonked out.
We just made it to the mall
and Jackson is just mesmerized
by all of the rocks.
Where are all the rocks, bud?
Do you see all of the rocks on the ground?
He's meditating.
We're just about to walk
in and there's already
a huge line of you guys.
You guys are so cool
for comin' out this far.
This is so amazing.
We're so excited to meet every one of you.
Jackson, Cheer Bear is
on his way right now.
Did you know that?
Are you so excited?
Look at all these guys here.
Hi!
Oh my gosh, Jackson, look right there.
Look right there!
Look, do you see 'em?
Look!
Look at that.
Isn't that so cool?
That is the biggest Care
Bear I have ever seen, Ellie.
(laughs)
Look!
That's so amazing.
Wow!
That is such a big Care Bear.
(laughing)
And there is Calvin.
If Calvin wakes up and
sees that giant Care Bear,
what he's gonna think?
Hi!
Jackson wants to show
him Rainbow Heart Bear.
Yeah.
(happy instrumental music)
Jackson is being such a
good helper giving stickers
to all of our friends.
(laughing)
Good job, bud.
Say hi!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Hello!
- Thank you guys so much for comin' out.
This is so fun.
Hi sweetie!
Hi! (laughs)
♫ Duh duh dun
♫ Duh duh dun
-  He's sleeping
through all of this.
♫ Duh duh duh duh duh duh
-  It's hilarious.
-  If you zoom out,
there's like tons of people.
(laughing)
- This girl is so cute.
She's reminding me of Eve
right now, with her unicorn.
She can't get enough of Care Bear.
So cute.
Calvin just woke up from a
nap and wasn't very happy,
of course, because he woke
up from a nap and he saw
the Care Bear and he was like,
so happy, which is so funny
'cause you'd think most kids
would kinda be a little scared
or something, you know?
He loves it.
Where's the Care Bear?
Do you wanna give the Care Bear a hug?
So fun.
We just finished up
- Woo!
- our Meet Up, which was so fun.
But we are now, we were invited to
Carealot.
- Carealot.
So, the kids are playin'.
Gotta show ya what they're doin'.
(happy instrumental music)
Now you're a Care Bear!
-  You're a Care Bear, Jackson.
(happy instrumental music)
- Woo!
That was unbelievable.
That was awesome.
It was so cool to be a part of that whole
Share Your Care Day with Care Bears.
Thank you, Care Bears, for having us.
That was so fun.
And not only that, we were
able to meet Tori Spelling,
Mario Lopez and his wife, and
so many other cool people.
And the kids had such a
blast in that play area.
Did you have fun today?
- Yes.
-  What was your favorite part?
- Bein' in the pit ball.
-  Playing with all
those friends in the ball pit?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
Well, I've got a great idea, Jackson.
We've had so much fun
today, but I think this
is gonna take the cake.
You know what we're gonna do?
- Yeah, we're gonna go swim!
- We're gonna go swimming!
Let's go get in the pool
guys, come on, let's go!
Let's get in the pool.
(talking gibberish)
-  Calvin's just standing here,
lookin' at the cars go by,
playing with the guitar.
Like, I wonder what he's
thinking in his little mind,
like how high this is,
and if it's scary or--
Like I get dizzy every
time I walk by there.
I get dizzy!
- Oh, you caught me drinking a Dr. Pepper.
Oh don't worry.
- That's okay.
- This is uh,
- Your first,
second Dr. Pepper.
- Well, it's my second Dr.
Pepper, and I feel like,
I haven't had a Dr. Pepper
since I started working out.
It's only been a few days, obviously.
But I would feel bad
if I didn't drink these
because the guys at the hotel
and the company went to great
lengths to make this happen.
So, I feel like it would
be a disservice to them
to not drink it.
-  Well, you didn't say
you weren't drinking Dr. Pepper.
- No, I didn't.
- You're just,
trying to be better.
- Yeah.
-  I'm happy for you.
Let's go.
Don't explain yourself.
- I just love it so much.
- You can drink it.
Just only like once a week (chuckles).
Okay, I think Calvin
won 'cause he's the one
that pushed the button.
-  Oh let's go, this way, this way.
-  Jackson, come on.
-  We lost him.
(laughing)
-  Good daddy.
- Yeah, he's goin' down.
(crying)
Don't worry, we'll get 'em.
We are such a (mumbles).
-  Calvin ran in as it shut.
Hopefully those guys were--
- You stay, you stay up here.
I'll go down.
-  Nope.
-  No, not in there?
- No you need to get in there.
- You going down?
Oh, we're going down.
We're going down.
-  Our kid just ran down.
-  Yay! (laughing)
Hi bud.
-  He was so scared.
-  That was like
the craziest thing ever.
You okay?
You alright?
(laughing)
Thank you guys.
-  You're welcome.
- I'm so sorry about that.
-  High five.
- You too, take care, bye.
That scared me dude.
You literally ran in the
door as it was closing.
(laughing)
That was the funniest thing.
Oh my gosh.
Are you okay bud?
You scared us.
You just ran in there
as the door was closing.
We couldn't even get in.
(kiss smacks)
Hello!
- Calvin!
- I was really like--
- Oh my gosh,
- In case they came back up.
Calvin, did you run away again?
-  Oh my gosh, that was crazy.
- The thing is, is we were
all getting in the elevator.
-  Yeah.
- Calvin ran in first, and
we were were gonna get in,
Jared's like, "Oh not
that," and then it closed.
- That was going down
and we needed to go up.
- Then it closed, and then the
two guys, and they were like,
"Oh no!"
(laughing)
Luckily, we're good.
- We're good.
Well don't you guys look relaxed?
This is the best ever.
-  Someone just gave us a towel.
That was so nice of them.
- A flamingo!
-  A flaming-ahahaha.
-  Flamingo!
-  A flamingo!
-  Is that so nice of them?
-  Yeah.
-  Say thank you, Jax.
- Thank you.
-  Oh, look.
He's bringing you guys some (mumbles) too!
- Here you are buddy.
- Aw, say thank you.
- You want a flamingo?
-  You guys are gettin'
spoiled left and right.
-  Yeah you are.
-  That's so funny.
-  Thanks guys.
(happy instrumental music)
- Calvin, what is up with you?
Daddy and I keep wondering.
I think you're goin'
through a big learning,
- Personality.
- just everything.
- Change.
- The things that Calvin
does, Jared and I both
look at each other and we're like--
- Where did that come from?
- He's dancing tons more,
he's brave in the pool.
Just like not even,
it's like, he wouldn't
even care if we were there
or not.
He would jump in.
- It's like, he's like
discovering himself.
- You are a handful,
to say the least.
(happy instrumental music)
Nothin' like givin' the
kids another lush bath,
watchin' us some TV and
getting some room service.
We have some food here.
It smells really good.
I'm very excited for mine.
It is a stir fry, so that's what I got.
Boys got chicken tenders.
I got a salad.
Yummy.
- Yeah!
-  Woo hoo, are you excited to eat?
- Yes.
-  This is so fun.
- I'm a shark.
- You're a shark?
(yells)
(yells)
- Not my wife, not my wife!
(grunts)
(Calvin yells)
-  Dad!
Dad!
- Yes?
(Jackson yells)
-  I'm mama shark and I always win.
(growls)
Okay, let's eat.
- Let's eat?
-  Let's eat.
(boys yelling)
We're kind of wild animals in here.
- I love it though.
I like your Care Bears onesie.
- Thank you.
- Miss Cheer Bear.
- I like it too.
- Yeah, we had so much fun
today seeing all of you guys,
seeing Cheer Bear and Beat
Buds at Share Your Care Day.
It was so much fun, and we
wanna thank all of you guys
for coming a long way to see us.
- It was fun to meet you guys.
- Yes, it was so fun.

running wild for a minute.

Calvin can't open that door.
(laughing)

We're good.
