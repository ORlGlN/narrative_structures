(bright music)
-  Guys guys guys, it's working.
It's working.
- She's running.
-  It is working.
(laughing)
(yelling)
- Waking up to a day with family
always puts a smile on your face.
We have our cousin Kate here.
And we are going to see
someone special today.
- Awww.
- Big hugs.
Good to see you.
(bright music)
- Mom is here to test
out the cinnamon rolls
that we have made.
Are they a 10?
- They are a 10.
(laughing)
- Please tell me they're a 10.
They're a 10 right?
I made cinnamon rolls yesterday
and we're eating some
for a snack right now.
And they're very good.
And Julie, it feels like
you never even left.
- It feels completely normal to be here.
- I know, it's just like
oh Julie's here, yay.
It's as if she never left,
so I'm happy to have you back.
- Well thank you.
-  What the heck Linc?
(laughing)
I'm mad.
- He was sitting there
- Hey.
- and he was like I want
- a bite and I was like
here, Ellie, have some.
- Have a bite.
-  That's my cinnamon roll.
(snorting)
You like my cinnamon roll?
Is it yummy to you?
What the?
You greedy little baby.
- We've got family back in town.
- Woo!
- Landon's in the house.
And Joel thought it'd
be the best idea ever
in the whole entire world
to go four-wheeling.
So that's what we're doing.
- Of course,
- we have to go four-wheeling.
- It's a beautiful day.
Cody, are you ready to hit the trails?
Let's do it, high five.
Boom!
(lively music)
(four-wheeler motoring)
I'll throw it to ya.
One two three.
Shhhh.
(Jared laughing)
Woo!
(Jared laughing)
(wind whipping)
(four-wheeler motoring)
- We shared a bed for how many years?
We can share a car.
(laughing)
Woo hoo, we are going for a ride.
- Oh it's so slow.
- Oh, we don't want to break it.
- Forward.
It's going so slow.
- I like it.
- Sorry kids, no batteries
for you in a minute.
- Push all the kids away.
- No battery left when we're done.
Oh no!
(laughing)
- We've taking up all the juice.
(cheerful jazzy music)
- So the boys just got back
and we're shuffling kids around,
getting them situated for bed.
And I want to show you this real quick.
So we went four-wheeling,
you obviously know that,
but I feel like there's an indication
of how much fun we had,
the more mud, the more fun.
This is my GoPro.
- Whoa.
What?
- It is caked in mud,
so we had a lot of fun.
- That's awesome.
- You probably don't want to touch it.
I'm gonna go wash it.
And that's the thing about
GoPro, it's waterproof,
so it's perfect.
- Do you guys remember when we bought
a huge bag of gummy bears
that supposedly they're sugar free
and they're supposed to make you poop?
We've had them.
We have family over.
We are gonna use them,
and we're gonna see if they work.
(laughs devilishly)
Now I'm not that mean,
I'm gonna go in on the game too.
I'm gonna be eating these,
as well, so we'll see.
Sugar free, look at the reviews on Amazon.
They're hilarious.
Gummy bears, Charleston Chews,
what other treats do I have in here?
And some chocolate, that should work.
- This is the first time Landon
has ever been to our house,
and so he's like I'm gonna
unload the dishwasher
and find out where everything goes,
so thanks
- I'm breaking in the house.
- for breaking in the house.
Ooh these look good.
- Alright, while we let
those gummy bears marinate,
we'll see if they work.
It was really funny,
we bought them forever
ago, wanting to do this,
and tonight's the perfect night.
Bonnie and Joel are coming over,
Landon and Julie are here,
we're getting the kids to bed,
we're all getting in the hot tub.
Jared said that a lot of you guys
have been asking what Jared got me,
when we were on the cruise ship
and he took me into the Tiffany's store.
So I do want to show you the necklace.
It was really sweet and thoughtful of him.
I will hold it right here.
Jared over the years of being married,
has bought me several really sweet items
that I will have forever,
and this is one of them.
It is a smiley little necklace
that goes kind of below my collarbone.
And it's really flattering,
it's really small and simple and pretty.
And that's what it looks like.
Thank you Jared.
I love it.
- Now I can see this going
a couple different ways.
Either it goes perfectly and
it's just a total disaster
or it actually is a disaster
and no one eats anything,
or they do eat it, and nothing happens.
So I don't know, I've had
a couple myself to see
if it actually does anything,
just to kind of lessen suspicion.
So we'll see.
This may totally backfire, I don't know.
We got to try it sometime.
And I think it's been long
enough that no one remembers it.
I'm like wait, let me turn the light on.
-  Are you ready?
-  Yes, ready, three two one.
Ooh eee ooh.
Wait, yeah, ooh eee ooh.
Do you have to do it for all of them?
-  I thought they were gonna like
-  I thought it was
- start moving and dancing
- or something.
- gonna be more grand.
-  Individually one by one,
and what was the pattern Ellie?
You started with that one,
you went all the way over there.
(laughing)
What is your pattern idea there?
- I was just trying to scare ya.
-  Ooh eee ooh.
- Very scary.
- That's cute.
- Very very scary.
Our house is scary.
Jackson comes up in the
middle of the night,
and he's like Mom and Dad,
there's ghosts in our house.
- Awww.
- Awww.
- Hey he loves them.
-  He does love them.
- They all watched Hotel
Transylvania today,
so they might have nightmares.
- Oh that was a little crazy,
that was Olivia's request.
- I love Hotel Transylvania.
- Well what's funny is like
what movies they do think about
in the middle of the night,
and what movies they don't,
because you're like Jackson
you just watched Spiderman
and you loved it,
and then you watched Curious George
and you have nightmares
about Curious George.
Like what the heck?
- He's a monkey, he's a monkey.
- I know.
(playful music)
We already have our first
victim, Ellie is down,
and I am dying right now.
I am prairie dogging like
crazy, holding it in.
-  Oh are you really?
- Yes I am.
-  You're not just saying that,
are you really?
- Yes I am.
I've had three and I'm dying.
I'm gonna go make 'em.
-  You're laughing,
but we're having issues.
- I know, it hurts.
Had you ever had one?
- Triple-stuffed
- Like triple-stuffed those things,
like I love stuffed Oreos
and I have a thin one
and I'm like mmmm.
- They have mega stuffed,
which are not that good.
-  No.
- Thin Oreos are like the go to.
-  The way to go.
-  We have so many good snacks.
Bonnie and Joel brought some over.
They're pretty good I guess.
Are you guys jelly-filled,
or just like regular donuts?
I'm regular for sure.
- Jelly-filled.
- It depends, because
if it's powder coated,
it has to have raspberry inside.
- I'm just not a creme-filled fan.
-  Creme-filled's terrible.
-  What?
-  Yeah.
- No.
- Lemon-filled, lemon-filled,
that's disgusting.
- What about like a Bavarian creme?
- That's where it's at,
chocolate and Bavarian
creme is our favorite.
-  That sounds good.
- But there's always like four bites
of plain donut and then all of a sudden,
one huge gulp of Bavarian creme.
- That's true yeah.
- And you're like, did I
just swallow a pudding cup?
- Maybe if they could distribute the creme
evenly through out the donut.
- I have had Bavarian
creme filled churros.
- That's a smart idea.
- That's good.
- You do it and then I'll do it.
Ready?
Nice.
- All of our machines were like
sliding into that position.
- That's three in a row.
Same time.
Did you catch yours?
- No, did you?
- Yeah, I barely got it.
- We got to throw it down, okay, ready?
(laughing)
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Did you choke it down?
-  Is it in your tonsil?
- It's like I regurgitated it.
-  Did you like hit it,
and throw it back out of your mouth?
- Okay, I think Landon has
had seven, seven gummy bears.
- Did you literally hear Julie.
- Did you ever get the ones from Amazon?
(slo' mo') Did you ever
get the ones from Amazon?
From Amazon,
from Amazon.
- She's like these aren't the
ones from Amazon, are they?
I was like, no.
Hot tub time.
Maybe it's stupid to get in the hot tub,
but we're doing it.
It's worth the risk, extra chlorine.
(laughs)
- A few moments later.
- How do you think the hot tub was?
- Amazing.
- It was so fun.
- Oh yeah.
- We have not been in it in a long time.
- It's not too hot,
and it wasn't too cold,
it was like perfect.
- I saw a shooting star.
But before we play our game for the night,
Landon you listening?
Those gummy bears are the ones
that we bought from Amazon, Miss Julie.
- I was like I swear you
bought some from Amazon.
And I swear these are still good.
-  Does anyone need to poop?
-  And Landon had a
ton, you've had a handful
and you've had a handful.
- Well I haven't gone
to the bathroom yet, so.
- So far Jared and I have
gone to the bathroom.
-  You haven't had to do anything?
- My bowels are solid.
- His bowels are solid.
- Seriously I've had like four of them
and I'm like, I cannot hold this.
-  Those?
- Yes.
- Yes.
-  No way.
-  No I'm dead serious,
Jared and I both went to the bathroom.
-  They're hard.
- I know.
-  They are.
-  She had to poop.
- Oh my god.
- She had to go poop.
- Literally I went to the bathroom before
we got in the hot tub,
and I did eat a few.
-  So no one got sick?
-  No.
-  Is this a bust?
-  It's a bust.
-  Are these busts.
- All those comments.
- Landon had like four.
-  Okay, we're
gonna keep eating them,
and let ya know.
(Ellie laughs)
Guys guys, it's working.
It's working, it's working, it's working.
Jared, it's working.
- We were just a little too anxious.
So I think the gummy bears
totally backfired on us.
I mean it really only
got me, Ellie and Julie.
Landon who probably ate the most,
didn't have anything happen to him,
but if you guys don't remember,
we ordered these from Amazon,
the sugarfree gummy bears,
they're supposedly supposed to make
your bowels explode, just
be totally devastating.
So we wanted to try and prank people
and we tried to lure them
in by eating some of them,
but it backfired on us,
and got us instead of everyone else.
Bonnie had some, Joel had some,
I think everyone had some,
but me, Ellie and Julie got it the worst.
But I don't know, have
you guys ever tried them?
Let me know in the comments down below.
It's probably not smart,
but I'll have a link to it down below,
if you guys want to try and get some too
and try and prank your friends.
We have to be quiet.
It's serious, kids are waking up.
We may have had a lot of fun
and laughed really loud,
and may have woken up some of the kids,
so we have to be quiet.
But Landon and Julie are
staying the night tonight.
We had a blast,
and that's where we're gonna end the vlog,
so thank you guys for watching
and we will see you next time.
Bye.
