- I wanna tell the story
of how we first met.
- See the shark!
- It's been a 10-year reunion!
-  Hammerhead shark!
-  You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna put my butt...
-  (laughs)
On the sand?
- Yep.
- Kay, let's see this.
We have kinetic sand in here
with their trucks and their rocks
and this has been an activity
that they have been playing with
for hours the last few
weeks, they love it!
It's just has kept them entertained
and spring is here, guys.
It is supposed to get
super warm this week,
but especially warm
with where we're going.
Ready to give me a sand
bath foot pedicure?
Is that what you're gonna do?
-  No.
-  Oh, it's cold!
(shivers)
- Mommy, you have to stand up and do it.
Sit your butt on it.
-  No (laughs)
- Why?
- I'm too big!
I can't fit in the bucket.
-  Okay, get out.
-  Ready?
On your mark, get set, take a break!
(laughs)
Good girl, Penny, you love
it out here, don't ya?
Come on, Ferdinand!
Let's get going on our walk.
We don't have all day to
stop and smell the roses!
Or in this case the tumbleweed, the weeds.
- Jared is just finishing up some work
before we head to the airport,
and I wanna show you the beautiful picture
that Jackson and Calvin drew.
Jesus. Jackson was so good, like,
he was going really slow and
patient staying in the lines
and then they got really excited,
but that looks awesome.
So we're coloring Jesus
and Jackson is tracing letters again.
(Calvin mumbles)
Oh, you're even tracing the
three, that looks awesome!
- Mommy, so tall!
-  It is tall.
(Calvin mumbles)
Wow!
Hello! Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
(upbeat music)
- Kay, are we going
straight or are we turning?
- Straight.
- Kay, go straight, keep
your eye on the road.
(giggles)
-  What do we do
at the lights, Jackson?
It's red.
(Ellie gasps)
- Stop.
-  Okay, whew.
Will you hit the breaks for us?
Good job.
Oh, it turned green, hit the gas!
- Hey!
(blows raspberry)
(upbeat music)
- Get this!
We um,
maybe are back in Las Vegas!
- But not in the camper!
-  We're not in the
camper, we're in a hotel
and we've got some fun
stuff for this weekend.
- And we literally are on a time crunch.
- Yes, this is a time crunch.
We are gonna go play.
(boys holler)
Hey guys, should we go
look at some sharks?
- Yeah!
Real sharks!
- We are here hanging out
with Jared's college friends,
it's been a 10-year reunion.
-  Yes!
- So we're gonna get together
with them and hang out,
but first, shark museum.
- Sharks are more important right now
than reunion time.
-  Hold hands.
- Are we gonna walk?
- Nope
-  Yep. We're gonna
walk, run, jump, skip
- Oh, I guess we are.
-  and all of the above.
And maybe take an Uber.
(upbeat music)
-  What's your name?
- What's your name?
- Shark!
- What?
- Shark.
- Shark? That's your name?
(Ellie giggles)
I don't see any sharks here yet.
-  What's your name?
- What's your name?
- Cal!
- Cal.
There's a wedding place,
so should we go get married over there?
- Jackson.
- No!
-  Should we get married?
- No!
-  Do you think mommy
and daddy are already married?
- Yeah.
-  We are?
- Yep.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Calvin, should
we go get married?
- Yes.
- Yeah!
- No!
- Are you getting a little nervous?
He says he doesn't wanna
go see a real shark, but,
he always asks if he can watch
real shark videos on YouTube
which I've had to, like,
pre-watch a few of them,
but he always likes sharks, so
you're just a little nervous?
Wanna hold my hand?
- No, I'm gonna run!
-  Okay, run.
- See the shark!
Go see the shark!
- Go see the shark.
-  Real shark!
-  What did you just ask me?
- How's your belly?
- My belly is good.
He asks that randomly.
He'll be like, "Mom, how are you feeling?"
Sweet thing.
- You can't put your finger
in the shark's mouth.
-  Why?
- Because he'll bite you and eat you off.
-  Oh, I won't put
my hands in the water.
-  What about our toes?
- No!
-  No, no way.
We'll just look.
-  What about your nose?
- No!
Not my owie!
-  He's serious about this.
'Kay, Jackson, do you wanna
give them the tickets?
Can you give them your ticket?
-  Come on, mister, no.
Stand up. (laughs)
- Ray! I saw the stingray!
I saw the stingray!
-  Look how big that fish is!
-  Whoa!
-  Oh my gosh!
-  Look at that one,
it's got a point on his
head like a unicorn.
It's a unifish!
-  Hammerhead shark!
- Did he just say that?
(Ellie laughs)
That's amazing.
-  We've been watching
shark videos. (laughs)
-  That's amazing.
- Where's the sharks?
-  They're gonna come around
the mountain when them come.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Calvin, what do
you think of the sharks?
- Sharks!
(gasps)
-  Great White Shark!
It's the Great White...
-  He's learning
all of these names, that's so cool.
- Two!
-  Two.
There it is again.
-  Hammerhead Shark!
-  Kinda looks
like one, doesn't it?
- What the!
Shark!
-  Oh,
Jackson!
- Hey Jackson, these are stingrays, right?
-  Yeah.
- Where do we not touch them?
- Not eyes, not tails.
-  That's right.
- We cannot go in there.
Look at that shark, mom!
-  What did he say?
Calvin, what did you say?
- It's going to eat me.
- Let's go.
-  It's not gonna eat you, bud.
Say hello!
-  Calvin!
(Jackson mumbles)
-  Oh, there it
is, there's the shark.
-  They've got their GoPros out.
Hey, I found a job for you.
- Yeah, how cool is this?
Scuba diving with the sharks.
-  Look at that shark
-  Whoa!
-  Oh my goodness!
He didn't even flinch!
What did you think of that?
-  He's coming
back, he's coming back!
(laughs)
Jackson, he must like you.
-  Calvin's outta here!
(laughs)
- He must like him. That was so crazy.
-  The turtle came out.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my gosh.
(Calvin babbles)
- I think I've got a squeak in my shoe.
(Calvin babbles)
Calvin...
- My pants.
-  Peeing in your pants?
- Yes.
-  Oh.
-  That was your
favorite part of the day?
- Mm hmm!
-  Jackson, what was
your favorite part of the day?
- Sharks.
-  Seeing the sharks?
- Yeah.
-  Good, mom,
what was your favorite
part of the day?
- Not peeing my pants!
-  Good, I'm glad
that that wasn't your
favorite part because it was probably
your least favorite
part when you did that.
- I think the airplane ride's always fun.
-  Yeah.
- That's always fun.
- The sharks were a lot of fun,
but I don't think my favorite
part has happened yet
and I'll tell you why.
12 and a half years ago,
I met my college friends
for the very first time
and every year at the end of the semester,
which would be in just
a couple weeks for us,
but 12 years ago,
we would go out to dinner
because it was right around
all of our birthdays,
we were celebrating the end of semester,
and we needed a break
from studying for finals.
It's been nearly 10 years
since we've done that
and since we've gotten
together, all of us,
and we decided that we
should do this again.
We should have a little reunion.
All of us live right around, like,
in a circular pattern around Las Vegas,
so we said let's all meet in the middle,
we'll come to Las Vegas
and we'll get together,
have a reunion for the weekend,
and have dinner just like
we used to in college.
So we're all getting together,
we're all gathering up tonight
so tomorrow we can have a wonderful day
with my college buddies,
their spouses, and their kids.
This is going to be a great weekend.
(upbeat music)
So my college buddies are here,
we're hanging out.
-  Hello!
- We got Nick, Kyle and Jasmine.
We're sitting around the table
just catching up on everything
and I looked at Kyle and was like,
I wanna tell the story
of how we first met.
And I told Ellie and
she's like, "Oh, geez,
this story again."
- Well, no, it's good for
especially kids and teenagers,
-  Yeah
let's just be friends with people.
- So, you had a roommate
from summer semester
and we're gonna see him
in a little bit, too.
I had a roommate who was
going to summer semester
and they were gone.
So I moved in, I was all by myself.
Kyle moved in and he was all by himself.
We were sitting, we did, like, the tour
and I came up late or I left
early or something like that,
the freshman tour around campus.
-  Orientation.
- Yeah, orientation, yeah,
I was thinking of the word.
And then we ended up back in our rooms
and I think our doors were open
'cuz we were like, we wanna
meet, you know, some people
and I remember looking at
you sitting you in your room
and thinking, like, this guy thinks
he's the coolest person in the world
because he's from California.
And what did you think of me?
Do you remember?
- I don't.
-  Okay
- So little recollection.
- Kay, well, you thought, you're like,
this guy left orientation early, he thinks
he's so stinkin' cool.
- Oh, yeah, I thought you were
I thought you thought you were
too cool for the rest of us.
- Yeah, and then, so we're
both looking at each other
thinking, like, this
guy thinks he's so cool,
and then we're just like, so,
do you wanna go get something to eat?
And then instant friends.
- Yes.
-  Like, that's how it happened.
- And then we went to Cosmo.
-  Uh huh.
- And then I do remember very,
I think there's maybe the week,
first week of college,
-  Uh huh.
- You came into my room
and were like, "Hey Kyle, I was just."
-  Yeah! Yes!
- "I was just wondering,
like, if it wouldn't be, like,
too much trouble if I could maybe just."
I'm like, "What is it, Jared?
Like I thought he was gonna ask me, like,
I don't know, for money or
take him across the country.
And he's like, "To borrow your syllabus."
Which is just...
- Just, yeah, it's like a
paper that we have in class
and Kyle was like, "Jared,
I'm gonna have you leave the room,
come back and ask again."
(group laughs)
- "This isn't how I function,
that's not how this
relationship's gonna work."
So I'm like, "Jared go
out and come back in
and have a little bit more
confidence in yourself."
-  Yeah!
- And Jared's like,
"Oh, okay."
- Timid little Jared,
Kyle set ground rules in
our relationship real quick.
- I love it.
- Well we did it like three times
-  Yeah.
- Because the second time it was, like,
"Hey Kyle, um, so,
can I maybe possibly, like,
can I borrow your syllabus."
And like, again, out the door.
- And finally I was like, "Give
me the freaking syllabus!"
- And that's how we're
gonna work from now on,
we just demand things from each other.
- That is...
I had not heard that part.
-  Isn't that so funny?
Yeah.
- That's fun.
- I forgot about that until just now.
And then Nick was the floor below us
and we didn't really like him
until the second semester.
(laughs)
- (mumbles) You didn't know me.
-  I'm just kidding.
- Get to know me!
-  Yeah that's right.
- Yeah, so I was one of the few
that jumped from the 2200
floor to the 3200 floor
to hang out with these guys.
-  Yeah.
- And it was like a barrier
we just didn't cross,
no one really did, except you.
- I honestly think I
was one of the only ones
that was friends with
people on the top floor
versus the middle floor.
-  Yeah.
And here we are 12 years later.
-  That's wild.
- Is it 12?
-  Shoot.
- Yeah, 12.
-  Yeah, 2006 so...
- 12 years later since we
met, can you believe that?
- And I actually live here in Las Vegas.
-  Yeah, you're the center point.
(laughs)
You're the reason.
- Everybody came to me.
- Yep, we're just hanging
out having some dinner
waiting for the rest of
the crew to get here.
Okay, the whole crew is
here, we've got everyone.
So what we decided to do is,
well, we already did this
with the first people here,
but we haven't seen each
other in, like, six years,
so we're gonna go rewind six years
and everyone's gonna give
us a full life update
-  Oh my hell.
of the past six years,
(group clamors)
day by day.
(laughs)
- It's gonna be a quick update
'cuz nobody's done anything! (laughs)
Hearing all of these stories and going
and remembering all of these
things with by buddies,
oh Ellie!
(laughs)
Just, it makes, it's fun going back,
whoo, hey,
in time and reliving
all of those experiences
and I can't wait to do it
for the next couple days,
but for now, we have to get some sleep
because we're gonna party tomorrow
- I'm so tired.
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Yeah, and it's like midnight,
and Ellie and I usually
don't stay up this late
unless, well, together.
-  (laughs) Never.
- I usually am working, but anyway,
that's gonna be it from us.
- Bye!
- Have a wonderful night,
we'll see you tomorrow. Bye!
