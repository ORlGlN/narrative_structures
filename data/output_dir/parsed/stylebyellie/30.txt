- This isn't even our final form!
Whoa there, cowboy! Whoa!
(kiss)
- (Ellie) Calvin? Who are you hiding from?
(murmurs)
From Jack?
(laughs)
So he doesn't take your cereal?
- And dad said to get him.
-  Dad said to
get him? He's hiding.
He's hiding from you.
Do you want me to help you do a dad?
- Yeah.
-  I'll draw it. D-A-D.
And now you try it next to it.
- Okay, I can't do a D.
-  You can.
- No I can't.
-  You do all the time.
You can trace mine first if you want.
Well, you got a little sloppy.
No, look, one down, go over.
- Like this?
-  Yep.
- I wanna make a X.
-  Good morning!
- Is this a X?
-  That is an X.
Look Jackson wrote that!
You're doing good!
- Okay boys, dad is
taking a break from work
and you know what we're going to do?
- Yeah
-  What are we going to do?
- Play in the snow
-  We are going
to play in the snow!
But here's the thing boys,
we've gotta figure out what we
wanna do so I have a
question for you, okay.
We can build two things,
we can build a slide or an igloo fort.
What do you want to build?
- Slide
-  A slide, you wanna
make a slide down the hill?
So we can go sledding?
- Yeah
-  Or do you wanna make an igloo
fort that we can climb inside of?
- A slide
-  A slide! Let's go
outside and make a slide!
Let's get all of our winter
clothes on, we'll get
nice and warm and we're gonna make a slide
and I think I know just how to do this.
Last time we've been having
trouble because there's too
much snow, it's not packed
enough to actually get
momentum and get going
but I think I can think of
something that will help us
get a nice run down the hill.
Hmmm, well we're all suited up.
Show me your outfits of the day.
You guys are all dressed and warm.
What do got on your neck there bud?
- Question mark Mario scarf.
-  Your question mark Mario scarf?
Is it keeping you warm?
And you've got your blue scarf on?
So we're out here in the
garage, I thought I had a
big like four by eight piece
of plywood that I could
mat down the sledding hill
so it would be like a nice
path with some barriers
that I could add to it.
But I can't find it, I
must have gotten rid of it
or something so I think
what we'll do, we've got
our sleds up here, up top
and I think I might just
use that to mat down the area.
The issue that we've been having with
our other sledding hills is that
there's too much powder on top,
it's not enough packed snow to get moving.
So I think I'll pack it all
first while these kids play
and then we'll have the
ultimate sledding hill
and I'll add some
barriers to make you turn.
And then we may go even
further beyond that.
This isn't even our final form!
Oh man, it's bright.
I think we've got about a foot
and a half of snow out here.
Grab the sled. What I'm
gonna do is pack it down
if I don't slip and fall.
(laughs)
All the way down to the bottom.
(light music)
I am out of breath.
Okay last but not least,
we have the final piece of the day anyway.
It's hard to tell, but
there's a ramp right here,
ah there it goes, right there
that little peak right there.
That's a big ramp for a little kid,
a huge ramp for a little kid and
that's going to give us some speed
off the top of the mountain,
the hill backyard slide.
The world's greatest
backyard slide at that.
Jackson, is this the world's greatest
backyard slide, sledding hill?
- Yep
-  You know, yeah, okay,
so let's put this guy to the test.
- I have to get on the, the fast part.
-  Yeah you do, pull
it over, oh you're so strong.
Whoa!
(laughs)
Okay, now are you guys
ready? Are you holding on?
Ready, set...
(screams)
Whoa, I think we are nearly ready.
We have built a little
course and it's only
gotten room for improvement but
most importantly we've got walls.
You can't tell, right over
there, there's a barrier
so they stay away from that fence line.
And go all the way down.
Jackson, are you ready?
Okay Jackson, give us
something good, give us a show!
Come on Mr. Olympics, let's go!
Okay, here you go, one, two, three, go!
Hey, we're getting there,
whoa, 360! 540! 720!
Oh my goodness, hey the
barrier worked, that's great.
Hey, that was awesome bud!
(light music)
Yeah!
Are you ready? Set, go!
Yeah!
Here comes daddy!
Okay, daddy's stuck!
(laughs)
Here comes daddy part two.
Daddy's stuck again!
Alright here comes daddy again.
Yeah!
Daddy's having a hard time.
Yeah! Good job bud, that was awesome!
Okay is this the first official run?
Take a seat maestro, I'm gonna pull ya.
So you go fast. Ready?
- Push me off.
-  Yeah I'll get you good.
- Turn too fast
-  You'll be okay, ready? Okay.
Look at me. I love you bud.
- I love you
-  Let's go! Here we go!
Oh no he went off trail.
Alright let's try that again.
Okay we've got some improvements to make.
How about, whoa!
(laughs)
You like that?
Okay let's try that again.
- Okay
-  You're ready for this?
- It made a X
-  It made an X? Yeah, okay.
Dad's gonna push you straight this time.
You ready for round two?
- Yep
-  Okay, here
we go three, two, one!
There we go! Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
-  Jackson and
daddy doing the drone.
Calvin couldn't stay out much longer.
I've got hot chocolate going and
I would say today is a huge breakthrough
with Calvin and potty training.
He has asked to go potty several times.
He's in there right now.
I'm so proud of him!
This process has been
pretty good this time around
just because we have been
like just more calm with
it, like it'll come when it comes.
When his potty watch
goes off, we are the ones
that are like, "hey it's time to potty!"
But he is starting to do that more
on his own and I'm so proud of him!
- Calvin poop!
-  Good job! I'm so proud of you!
- Thank you mom.
- You're welcome! Should
go pick out a prize!
- Yeah
(light music)
- Did you boys have fun
playing outside in the snow?
- Yeah
-  Yeah? Did you, Calvin? Good.
We had a blast, didn't we?
- Calvin kind of came in
before you filmed, huh?
-  Yeah, he was cold and kept
taking his gloves off so,
-  Stinker
- Yeah, he's a little stinker.
We're working on that aren't we?
What you missed, Calvin, was Jackson
and I built a ramp at the beginning
of the sledding hill and what did it do?
- It made us go fast.
-  Yeah it did.
- You were there for the
work but not the fun.
-  Yeah, I know.
(laughs)
That's kind of how I feel is like,
I did all the work but it's like the snow
is like too soft for me
to have any fun with it.
(laughs)
-  Jackson let's
see your guitar solo again.
(screams)
(laughs)
(screams)
-  Awesome!
Hey, how was shoveling the driveway
in your cute, little, tight pants?
- It's good
-  Hey, are you tired?
Did you get too much hot cocoa?
Did you have fun outside?
The boys are wiped out.
They're watching some YouTube videos.
To show you how cute this is
(soft music)
- When lips attack!
(kiss)
(kiss)
Hey stinky boy, it's time for your bath!
(screams)
You're naked, go get in the bathtub!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go get in the tub!
Well looky here, aren't
you a sight for sore eyes.
It is perfect timing
that we got this today.
My goodness gracious,
so with this pregnancy
when Ellie is up, oh my gosh, she is up!
And When she is down,
well, she's, she's down and
I think her energy is
just zapped today so,
I don't often cook, but
when I do, it's usually
with Hello Fresh because
the ingredients are all
laid out for me,
everything is just so easy.
I've got the instructions
ready to go, divided portions
and it tastes so stinking good.
Inside our box, we have
three meals to choose from.
We've got steak, stir fry and quesadillas.
Calvin, which one should we have tonight?
- Um
-  This one? Steak?
I think that sounds delicious,
oh yeah, that would be great.
On these cards, you have
all of the instructions,
all of the ingredients
and just some fun tips
and tricks for making these
the best way possible.
(light music)
-  My little heart
strings cannot take this,
watching Peppa, oh it's so cute.
Why did you ruin it?
- I walked over and she saw me,
and she was like "oh, hi dad."
-  Well that was
really funny, I just posted
the cutest Instagram story ever.
-  Hey, if you're not
following us on Instagram
or Twitter, you should do
it because I was just gonna
say like that's where we give
the most up to date things.
If you wanna know exactly when the
vlog is posted, follow us on Twitter.
-  Hey, I wouldn't
trust her around there.
(laughs)
- If you wanna get funny updates,
cute updates, real time, then Instagram.
And here is the final result.
(excited screams)
(laughs)
- Yay!
-  You're welcome.
Do you wanna know what the best part is?
It actually looks like the picture like...
(excited screams)
- We got my mom and dad
this for Christmas guys
because we've talked about
this like all year long.
We had subscription on our own.
We love it so I'm happy to have
Hello Fresh sponsor today's video.
-  Absolutely.
- It's delicious.
- And Ellie's parents
freaking love it too.
- And they're gonna be really sad
when their Christmas gift is up.
(laughs)
-  Okay mom,
what's the final verdict?
- It's, its how it always is.
-  So perfect and amazing?
- Yeah.
-  Oh I'm so glad you like it.
This tastes, it's so good, I love it.
Okay, round two tomorrow.
Alright full disclosure
here, you know that we've
had Hello Fresh for such
a long time but during
the holidays we actually
paused our subscription
because we were traveling,
we were with family,
we were cooking all the time
different things you know,
different plans that families
have but the beauty of
Hello Fresh is that you can pause it
and you can resume it, which we have done.
They continue to deliver for
free right to your doorstep
in this awesome box with all
of your meals inside of it.
What would you say that
took us, 30 minutes to cook,
I mean, I did the cooking,
I did the cooking.
Thirty minutes to cook
the whole thing and it was
oh, I just can't it's so,
sounds so weird to say but
it's quick and easy but it is.
Whoa there cowboy, you can't
wash the dog in the dishwasher.
- Oh my gosh, trash, garbage.
-  Anyway, what I was
saying, it took about thirty
minutes to cook the meal and
when you've got a pregnant
wife and you don't want to
have to think about your meals.
- You deliver.
- You have it delivered
to your front door.
Ellie literally had a breakdown
for thinking about what
to cook so this just takes
the whole thought process out
of it and into your mouth, it's delicious.

This kid, you are so hyper. Yee haw!
-  Calvin!
-  Giddy up cowboy!
- It's like, we know
if Calvin takes a nap,
especially in the later evening,
he's not going to bed at bedtime.
-  Yeah.
- But it's pretty hard
to like, you don't want,
I don't want to force my child to take
a nap but if he falls asleep...
-  Right.
- And I didn't even notice, like he will
just go up and fall asleep.
-  We've gotta see what he's
doing right now, he's into something.
- Hey! Oh my gosh!
-  How did you get that up fast?
- Get out of here.
(laughs)
- He is taking all my...you're
demolishing everything!
-  Hurry before he
demolishes the next room.
- No! Oh my gosh.
(laughs)
-  Thank goodness
for these magnetic strips.
I don't know why Apple got rid of them
in the newest one with
the USBC? Yeah, I know.
-  Won't be buying that...
-  These have saved so many...
Yeah.
See, how easy that is? I love it.
Okay, we've got two blondes.
We've got my wife,
Ellie, and Julie, Ruby...
- And the sweetheart
he always calls Ellie.
-  Or who could it be?
Could it be Jennifer, my sister?
It's Jennifer, my sister!
And Cannon! You know
what's funny, from behind,
you probably had no idea,
you probably couldn't tell
who it was but it's my sister, Jennifer.
Happy birthday last week.
- Thanks!
-  Ellie is doing some hair and
watching The Bachelor.
And Cannon and I, what are we doing bud?
Are we playing with cars? Yeah!
