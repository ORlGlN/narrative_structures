- Hi, you brought me the camera?
-  No I'm filming you.
- Oh you're filming me?
-  Yeah, okay.
- Okay come closer to me,
okay, lift it up, so you can see my face.
Good job.
I asked Jackson to go
grab the camera for me,
and he said he wants to be my camera man,
so I'm gonna let you.
I wanted to give you guys a
Okay, you can't push the record button,
leave it recording.
I wanted to give you an update on my hair,
since I recently cut it
and I recently colored it.
And I told the lady that I wanted
it to be pretty blonde.
So I had told my color friend
that I wanted my hair to be really blonde,
so she did a really
That wasn't working out very well,
but I told my hair stylist
that I wanted my hair to not be so gold,
so she toned it, and it
looked kind of almost gray
and I loved it.
It was like this white, platinum color
but it doesn't stay very long,
and so I've been using purple
shampoo and conditioner
to help keep it not go so gold.
And I really like it right now,
but I've had a lot of people ask
how I've been curling it
with it being short lately,
and if I liked the
curling iron that I used
at Bonnie's house.
It was called The Beachwaver.
And I'm gonna be really honest,
I haven't used Bonnie's
curling iron long enough
to know if I really like it a whole ton
to give like a good review,
but I still like how I do it
a little bit better,
because I feel like The Beachwaver,
especially if you're not
used to curling your hair,
you could damage it, because you insert it
and then you push the button to roll it.
And it's just kind of different.
But it's a beautiful curl.
But what I did today is
I just blow dried it,
and then I took the ends of
my hair with the flat iron,
and just went through
just my ends a little bit,
and then I have my curling wand.
This is the NuMe curling wand,
but there's also one on Amazon
that's Bedhead curling wand
that was like $30 dollars,
at least it was two years ago,
that I got, that I really liked too.
So I just have my curling wand
and I just warp it around
and I leave the bottom like an inch out,
so I don't curl it.
And then I let go, and
that's the curl I get.
And that's what I've
been doing with my hair,
so I wanted to give you
guys a little update.
- So I wanted to give you
a little update on my hair.
It's still going gray, crazy I know.
But I really am enjoying this hair cut
that Ellie gave me.
The part's really nice.
And my hair just feels
really healthy and strong.
So I just feel like this is a really
really nice thing that I
have going for me right now.
I'm gonna just try and keep it going
the way that I have been.
So I don't know, what do you think,
do I look pretty good?
Maybe throw a little product in there?
I think I will.
(laughing)
(crickets)
(laughing)
- What is this for?
- That's why I think banana creme
on a chocolate donut
would just be the best
kind of creme you could get.
Don't you think?
- I concur.
I'm glad we settled this.
- Raspberry creme is pretty good too.
- But only on
- We've been over this.
- Powdered donuts,
We've been over it a
hundred times already.
Okay, that's what this
whole meeting is about.
She just doesn't listen to me in meetings.
Bonnie will you go over
the notes real quick,
and tell me when Ellie
was actually listening?
- Well first of all, I just need to say,
all this donut talk is really rude,
because I'm trying not to eat donuts!
(Jared laughs)
- I ate the two that
you left on the counter
the other night, oh my god yeah.
- It was hard for me to refuse it.
- We are just hanging out here.
We had a meeting.
We had a meeting, can you believe it?
- Like an official one, too.
-  Yeah, this is not the first time
that we've done this before.
- We gathered and met.
- Before we actually
go, let's plan on when
we're gonna have our next
planning meeting, okay?
We need to make sure
that we're dead ahead.
Do you guys ever had that done,
like when you're in a
meeting, you're like okay,
let's plan on our next planning meeting.
- A meeting about a meeting.
- Yeah, exactly.
- That's my favorite kind.
- No it's the worse kind.
- Are you sad?
- Yeah.
- You're sad?
- I'm sad.
- Oh I know how to make it all better.
(kisses)
(laughing)
- Stop.
- You want me to stop?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
-  Hey Cal.
- Hey I'm busy.
He's wearing this.
He doesn't love it, but I do.
Is this not the cutest little jacket.
- It is, I want one in
my size, I really do.
It's so cute.
- But he's wearing it.
-  You wear it.
-  Come on, let's
change your bum bum.
-  Yeah, you're a stinky bum.
We've got to change your bum.
- Scarecrow.
-  Scarecrow.
(laughs) Did you hear that?
- I've a gift for Grandma Great.
-  Yeah, you're gonna
give her some seashells, huh?
- Should we go give 'em to her?
Where did we get those seashells?
- The beach.
- On the beach at North Carolina, huh?
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
- Oh my goodness, what do you have?
-  Hi.
-  Hi love.
-  Hi.
-  How are you?
-  I'm good, how are you?
- Hi you.
- Hi Grandma.
- Good.
- Hey Grandma.
- Good to see you.
- How's Calvin?
- Do you have a hug for Grandma?
- Can you give her a hug?
Yeah.
- Where did you get these?
- We got them from North
Carolina at the beach.
(Laughing)
- And did you gather those up for Grandma?
- For you and Grandpa.
- Awww.
- Awww.
- That's sweet.
- That was cute.
- He thought about you.
He said, I have to bring
Grandma some shells.
She asked for some seashells.
These are his.
- Yeah.
-  (laughs) He's
got quite the collection.
- So you have a little bit.
- Oh my goodness, did
you gather up all those?
- Yes, he, for days, he collected, days.
- Wow
-  And we brought 'em home.
- What a sweetheart.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Grandma has quite the collection
of seashells herself that she's gathered
over the years growing up as a kid,
going to all these different beaches
and traveling with her kids on her own.
So I want to show you some of these ones.
Look how beautiful these are Jackson.
Is that so cool?
-  Huge, big big big big.
- Yeah, these are so big in here.
Grandma Great has so many
wonderful trinkets and shells.
They're so cool.
- I want to get this one.
-  That's a big one, huh?
I bet you could hear the ocean
really good in that one.
(chill guitar music)
- You don't have your coat on.
-  I have, I do.
- Where is he taking Grandma?
- I don't know.
- That's so silly.
- We were in the middle of talking
and he takes Grandma somewhere.
- You are being so cute.
I looked at Jackson a few times today
and I thought, I know
what you're gonna be like
when you're 18.
Like it just popped into my head.
You just seem mature today.
Your body and your head.
You just look like a big boy,
eating all those M & M's.
(laughs)
Are you gonna be a nice boy?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  You are.
I mean like, (laughs)
I just feel like you'll look
just like your dad, huh?
And you'll be nice, just like him.
You're goofy.
- Bye.
(Ellie laughing)
(chill guitar music)
I told Jackson today he
looked, I just feel like
I know what he was gonna
be like when he's older.
- Yeah.
-  Doesn't he just look big today.
- Yeah, and I think it's the outfit.
That makes so much of a difference,
it's like you're bundled up,
you're dressed up,
and he's being a helper.
- You're helping.
-  You're starting
to learn how to work, huh?
- Yes.
- And if you work really hard,
I'll let you take me to dinner.
-  Ooh.
(Ellie laughing)
(upbeat piano music)
- It's a boutonniere.
Come on, that's from Grandma.
Does it smell good?
(Ellie laughing)
(bright music)
- Awww.
-  The music's over.
Music's over.
-  Why is it over?
(bright music)
- I always love going to visit my Grandma
and today was especially nice,
because we were able to help her out
with some things in the
yard that she was going
to do today, but she said it was too cold
to do herself,
so perfect timing for us
to make a visit there.
And it was especially sweet seeing Jackson
interact with her, because
it was just so tender,
the way he was talking to Grandma,
and how much he wanted to see her
and give those to her.
While we were down in town visiting her,
we made a stop at Best Buy
and I picked up another camera.
As you just saw, we've been dealing
with so many issues with these G7 X's.
I can't remember how
many we've gone through,
like four or five of them,
but I just had to get something new
to try it out.
I think I've tried the Mark IV once before
but didn't like it, but I
know a lot of my friends,
Ruby and Kevin, my buddy Dalen,
a lot of people use this.
I think Casey Neistat uses
this for his pocket camera.
But we're gonna try it
out and see what we think,
but I know with my luck, with my luck,
Canon's gonna come out and announce
a new G7 X probably this next month,
Sony's gonna come out with
another one this month
or something like that,
just because I bought this today.
I know that's gonna happen
and it's gonna be right
after the return period,
so cross your fingers that,
I don't know, maybe it's a
good thing, maybe it's not,
but either way, that's my luck.
Why are you so stinking cute?
You are just so cute.
Let's get some light on in here.
15 pumpkins.
- Do you think the moms will be okay,
if the kids put spiders on their pumpkins?
(laughing)
-  Are these like gothic pumpkins?
- I love them.
-  Oh good, you
got some googly eyes.
Googly eyes on anything is hilarious.
- And cute.
-  Do you think we should put
some googly eyes on Penny?
(laughing)
- Shh, Calvin's in his bed.
- Sorry oh.
- I have activity days
tomorrow for church,
so I have a bunch of girls coming over,
and this is what we're
gonna do is paint pumpkins.
- Awesome, this is so fun.
If you guys didn't know,
pumpkin carving is one of my favorite
all-time activities ever.
- We'll do it this year.
- And we will totally do it.
Here's a good question, okay.
Question for the comments down below.
Please vote for what I should carve
on a pumpkin this year.
If you see one in the
comments that you like,
give it the thumbs up,
instead of typing it again,
so that way the top ones go to the top
and that sort of thing.
And then I'll see,
I'm not gonna guarantee it,
because this is the internet,
but I'll see if the top rated one is okay,
I'll carve that.
-  If it's doable.
- Yeah, if it's doable and appropriate.
- You haven't done one really
since you've been on YouTube.
Have you done one?
- Well I have, but I don't
think it turned out that great.
-  It was because it
was in our old apartment.
- Yeah it was.
But I will have time this year,
and we'll make it happen.
- This year we will do it.
- So here's what you can do.
If you have a good idea,
type it in the comments down below.
If you see that idea
or anything like that,
give it a thumbs up.
-  Insert some
examples that you've done.
- Okay, I'll put some
ones from a long time ago
that I did, just to give
you guys some ideas.
(quirky music)
- Uuh.
Thanks for watching guys.
Have a good night.
