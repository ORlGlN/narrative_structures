- But when Jackson's done, he's come up
with some brother names.
(yelling)
How many people are
cringing of that right now?
Go get it girl, go get
it, go get it, go get it.
How did we do this last year?
-  This is me.
- This is our entertainment for the night.
We are running late for
an appointment today.
The tub is still full of water.
But I'm all dressed so
I don't want to drain it
right this second.
We're running late, we gotta hurry.
Our gender reveal is going up
tomorrow and we've had quite
a few people upset that
we are two days behind
and they've definitely
voiced their opinion
and just to reiterate, this
has been the best decision
Jared and I could have made for each other
being two days behind.
It's helped Jared a lot, not
being up 'til one and two
in the morning every single night editing.
It's just been refreshing for me and him.
I feel like we've been able to spend more
quality time together.
And so if we're going
to continue daily blogs,
it has to this way and
I've really enjoyed it also
because I've been able to
just sit and enjoy knowing
that I'm having a little boy on the way
and just really enjoy it
before I just like throw it out
and have, you know, lots of
comments or lots of attention
towards that and I really enjoyed that.
But when Jackson's done he's come up
with some brother names for brothers, so.
I'm gonna let him tell you.
- Jackson, Calvin and Mason.
- What other name did we think of?
- Charlie.
- Charlie, that's what Jackson
came up with this morning
was Charlie.
What do you like?
Do you like Charlie or Mason?
- Mason.
- Mason?
I like Mason the best too.
- Hmm.
- I think you're so cute.
When we were, let's go get our shoes on.
When I was, when we were
pregnant with Calvin,
(whining)
You need more chocolate milk?
- Yeah.
- Let's go get our shoes on.
When we were expecting Calvin
we came up with a few names,
Dalen.
I brought up, sorry the
lighting's kind of bad.
I brought up Mason a little
bit, but Jared didn't love,
love that.
I still really like the name Mason.
I think it's cute that Jackson,
I didn't even tell Jared, Jackson came up
with the name Charlie.
- Charlie.
Aw.
-  You look cute.
- Do you love this hoodie?
-  Where'd you get it?
- I just ordered it online.
Well I didn't just order it.
But I got it in the mail
from Dicks.
-  Looks good.
- Like isn't this awesome?
-  Yeah.
- Love it, it's comfy.
-  Yeah, Charlie.
- That's cute.
- Jackson, Calvin and Charlie.
Jackson, Calvin and Mason.
Do you like Charles?
- I like Charlie better than Charles.
But I like Charles as in Charles Drippy.
- I like Charles a lot.
No, no I don't.
Nope, I said it and I don't.
(laughing)
I mean I like the name
but not for the baby.
- Where's my gray orichi shoes?
-  Okay, gotta find them.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Literally, okay so we
worked with a company like
six months ago and it was,
it was the Orishi shoes that had come out.
And Jackson's shoes
aren't the Orishi shoes.
My shoes were called the Orishi shoes.
And Jackson every day, I
wanna wear my Orishi shoes,
and he calls those his Orishi's.
I think it's hilarious and so cute.
(laughing)
We were in a little bit of a
rush getting out of the house.
And our car seats are out of the other car
because we took Bonnie and Joel
to Mom and Dad's last night
so we got in this car.
And this is the car,
- That I take penny in,
all the time
- Everyday.
(chuckling)
- And Penny goes
(yelling)
- How many people are
cringing of that right now?
I am too, it's like all over your back.
We just need to clean it, that's all.
Just clean it.
- You know, it doesn't
matter if we lint roll it.
If she's in here one
time that's what happens.
-  I know, I know.
And then there's like bird poop
all over the car.
-  Eli, our image!
(laughing)
Our image.
I can feel it melting.
- Has anybody else been
letting their chores slack off
before Christmas?
And is everybody else
running around trying
to get their chores done?
This is what a week, or
two weeks looks like.
I'd say about two weeks.
What it looks like with
me not doing laundry.
(sighing)
K, I'm in for some work.
I'm going to fold laundry
and put a smile on my face
even though this is what I want to do.
(fake crying)
Cry, but I'm gonna put a smile on my face.
(laughing)
There's so much laundry!
And to think, here's
Jackson's, here's Calvin's,
there's gonna be another little boy's.
So much laundry.
That's the hardest thing for
me to keep up, is the laundry.
That's the hardest part.
I need more lint rollers
because having Penny around
like, especially during the
Winter, cause she's inside
a lot more.
I'm like, okay, we need to
like, lint roll everything
and everyone and every wall.
So that's one thing I'm
gonna put on my list
is get some lint rollers.
Look at the icicles that
are in the snow, people.
That is so crazy.
It's so like, soft.
Hello.
-  Hello.
-  Hello.
-  Hello.
-  Penny did you spot something?
Go get it girl, go get it,
go get it, go get it girl.
(laughing)
-  My turn.
This is me.
-  This is our
entertainment for the night.
Jumping onto a balloon, onto pillows.
Everyone's happy, dandy and dory.
- Just keep swimming.
(cheering)
- You better hurry and move.
(yelling and laughing)
-  My turn, my turn.
-  Okay, my turn.
- You gotta get out of the
way, gotta get out of the way.
-  My turn.
- I told Bonnie we have not
done this in a very long time.
Where we sit in her basement
and just watch the kids play.
We played a hide and seek game with them.
And now they just found something
that will entertain them.
I feel like there's 1,000 voices.
Can you hear me?
(laughing)
- It's kind of, I know, I know.
- I think it's funny.
Well I told Jared and I
told you guys the other day.
I was like, yeah, we're totally
going to decorate our tree.
Like, it would make me sad
if I just didn't decorate it.
And it's like, it's nighttime now.
We've been running around all
day and I'm like, you know,
it's not going to get decorated.
I'm a flip flopper this year guys.
And it's not going to, and that's,
unless I change my mind
again which I might.
But for now, I'm going
to watch my kids play.
And we're going to go home
and go to bed and then Jared
and I are going to watch
some of the IVF Grant videos.
We gotta start doing those,
and I'm excited about.
-  I feel like
you shouldn't do that.
- Just make a lavia dosa.
-  Oh my gosh, okay, thank you.
(laughing)
- I wasn't going to put bulky on there.
My luck, I'd fall right on my belly.
-  Mom, never watching me.
Mamma, record me.
- Bonnie just made Olivia go.
And I was like, Olivia I'll go with you.
K Jacks, let's watch.
Yeah, he goes on his feet.
(laughing)
- Well, it is officially official.
Eli and I have sent out our
Reddit secret santa gifts.
I'm really excited about this year.
Last year was a lot of fun
and Eli was really excited
to do it this year.
We sent out our gifts.
Eli's secret santa has shipped her gift.
And we're just waiting to see
if mine makes it, we'll see.
But I'll keep you posted.
I think secret santa things
like this, especially when
you have no idea who the person is.
You just have like a few
questionairre things to go off of.
It's so much fun.
Sam from, Samaca and I were
talking about it, and he has
a really cool person
that he's giving a gift,
a really sweet gift to also.
So I just, I love this kind of stuff.
- And was that it?
Was that the blog?
I'm sitting here editing
the blog that you are
watching right now.
Jared is getting a ton of work done.
It is, my eyes are so
tired, it is only 10:30.
We've been going over a lot
of the IVF applications.
Last night and tonight we
need to go over a lot more.
So I'm trying to help Jared
out here while he's getting
work done then we can go work together.
Thank you guys so much for
being patient, especially
with today's blog.
As I was editing it I was
like, this is definitely more
of the simplest blogs we've had.
It was just like, kind of
like loungy, what we did
for the day.
We didn't like do anything
extra special but I hope
that you guys did enjoy it.
I thought Jackson was sure sweet coming up
with the name Charlie.
And just to let you guys
know, I did end up decorating
the tree.
I got some energy in me and
the kids and I decorated
and it was so fun and it's so beautiful.
And I'm so glad that I did that.
I hope that you guys
are having a good week
before Christmas.
I hope you guys have
some really fun plans.
I think just the preparation
is one of the funnest things
for me, just like you know
getting the tree decorated,
having energy to do that,
going grocery shopping,
getting everything that
I need in the house
so that we can just have a really
at home enjoyable Christmas
just with my family.
I'm so excited for that.
Last night when Jared
and I were going over
the IVF applications,
it was very draining.
But I don't say that in a
bad way, it's just emotional,
it's draining, it's people
putting their stories out there
for us to watch and listen.
And after like the third or
fourth video, I looked at Jared
and I was like, how did
we do this last year?
How did we get through this?
Like, how are we gonna
get through it this year?
Like, how to possibly choose,
and it just, there's a lot
of amazing people out there
and there's a lot of deserving
people out there.
And one of my absolute
favorite things is in all
of the videos, at the
very end the people say,
we don't deserve this more
than any of the other people
that applied for this grant.
We wish everyone the best.
And that's what everyone
was saying last year too.
And like just, it really just
goes to show you that there is
a lot of good in the world.
And it's hard to see that when it's like,
social media's just such a
huge thing, it's like you hear
and you see a lot of negativity.
And negativity's always been
there, always will be there.
But we just see it so much
more because it's out there.
You know, and at church
they were talking a
about balancing life
and how it's really hard
to balance life because like
if you're at work, well then
your family, and if
you're with your family,
sometimes you're neglecting work.
And it's just like you're
always being pulled
and it's just like a really
good reminder, like when
you're with your family,
really be with your family.
When you're at work, make
that time your work time.
And when you're at church or
if you're doing something,
like make sure you're
time is in that time.
And I've been trying
extra hard to do that.
Like, if I'm with the kids,
to not have my phone around me
just so I don't even answer phone calls.
So I don't even be tempted
to look at like social media.
Just be with them.
And that's something that
Jared and I have been working
on a lot lately, is when
it's time to work, we work,
but then we'd be done, and
we have to just turn it off.
You know, and I really enjoyed that.
And I don't know how I got
into this pill but I did.
But,
(laughing)
that's just me talking.
So, thank you guys for watching.
Can't wait to watch some
more of those videos.
Get it in the blog, finish
editing this last clip,
and then we'll get going with our night.
Bye guys.
