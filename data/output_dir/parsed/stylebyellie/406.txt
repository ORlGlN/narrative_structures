Lincoln I want you put back over there
hurry bossing leaking in this book side

watches that watches they're educating
sounds good that's a good helper you're
watching best gear you decided to stop
helping huh
you wanna go home there you go good job
you're such a good helper this face is
like so nervous but excited it's a good
awesome but you did touch how I feel the
end of something has dropped and then so
at our church I actually teach a class
and so most every Sunday night I
actually team teach with someone so we
switch off every once in a while but
it's my Sunday to teach this class I've
just been kind of going over all of
these notes and these lesson manual and
then it being and preparing this lesson
I felt like a big book to like go
through like as a lesson guide and
everything the cool thing about where we
go to church is no matter where you go
all of the churches are on the same
lesson so if we were in Washington we
could go to church and we still have the
same same exact lesson that we would
have here in Utah so I'm preparing the
lesson right now and it's pretty cool I
have a lot of fun with it and I'm
excited
when I was a kid I always loved on my
teachers like in school or a church I
love women too teachers would have a
video I'm definitely putting a video and
today's lesson because I want to be the
cool teacher right that's the way with
me to do know it's awesome I'm an
awesome feature and just like that we
are back from church and we are getting
ready for the Super Bowl we've got some
snacks here all set out Bonnie and Joel
brought like a seven-layer bean dip
we've got some soda pop and we've got
the most important thing Joel I mean the
Super Bowl the Super Bowl is on getting
ready for the coin toss I am so excited
I don't know if I've called this a Super
Bowl party but this is like my first
Super Bowl gathering at my house I'm so
excited
got the big screen surround sound we got
a bunch of snack upstairs it's going to
be great excited but who do you want to
win the Patriots and Falcon do you want
the Falcons to win
Joel I don't know this isn't terrible
papa
Joel's team is not in so that's that's
the thing as far as me like I wouldn't
call myself a Patriots fan or a Falcons
fan like those are not like my go-to
teams but I'd love to see Tom Brady win
a Super Bowl another Super Bowl but I'd
also love to see the Falcons take it
from the patreon so it's like I just
really want to see a really good game
