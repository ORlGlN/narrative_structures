-  Morning, Mr. Jackson.
(lively music)
Morning, Miss Penny.
- Now I can talk.
-  Now you can talk?
Oh, cause you were eating?
Jackson, last night you slept
with Calvin, how was it?
- It was good.
-  Did you sleep all night?
- Mhm.
-  And he slept all night?
- Mhmm.
-  Wow.
- He got out.
- He got out?
You know, the kids actually
did really well last night,
they woke up once and
both of them were crying,
and Jared went downstairs
and told them both,
he goes, "Lay down,"
and then walked out, and they did great.
But they did wake up
early, they woke up at six.
That's not too bad though,
they slept through the night
and I am so proud of them,
and they had fun,
and then they've been playing all morning.
So, last night, I would
say, was a success.
You know how it took me forever to get the
Christmas decorations?
Well, it's taking me
forever to get them down,
and I'm okay with that.
I guess one day at a time, right?
Like, one thing put away a day,
so by the, by February first
everything will be put away.
That's my goal.
Penny, girl.
Penny (chuckles).
I went in the bathroom, I was like,
Jared, is Penny in here?
He's like, "How'd you lose her?"
I literally was like,
I lost her, like,
with Penny, she's still a puppy
and we definitely do not trust her
just to wander the house
if we're not by her.
She will chew up
something, like (chuckles),
she's still just a puppy, so.
I was like, where did she go?
I went in there, I was looking for her,
and then I came out and she
was just sitting by the stairs
watching Jackson come up.
She disappeared from me.
Crazy, huh?
Miss Penny trying to trick me.
Trying to trick me,
you little stinker.
You were quiet and sneaky,
you were probably behind
the Christmas tree.
Trying to break some bulbs, huh? (laughs)
Belly scratch time (laughs).
Belly scratch time.
(laughs)
- What is this?
-  That is her nipple.
You know how mommy breastfeeds?
That's how Penny will
breastfeed if she has babies.
- Hey, belly scratch time.
(laughter)
-  She thought it was
time to scratch your belly.
(laughs)
- Scratchin' her belly time.
♪ Scratching her belly time ♪
♪ Penny loves belly scratches ♪
We're getting the snow back,
snow is coming like crazy.
Ellie just went to go get some groceries
from the grocery store and she said
the roads are so slick,
which is super disappointing
because I had some fun
plans that I wanted to do
with Ellie and the boys today,
and we'd have to drive through
the canyon to get there,
and I just don't think
it's as smart to do that
because we kinda have to hustle,
and hustling in the snow
is not what you wanna do.
But, this is very good for skiing,
because I think Jackson and I,
his birthday is next week,
I think we're gonna try and
go skiing early in the morning
on his birthday.
We'll see about that.
So, snow, I love the
snow, but I hate snow.
You're giving me more
plans for the future,
but you're taking away
from my plans right now.
This is a very big conflict right now,
and I don't know which side of the fence
I want to be on.
Oh, what a strong boy--
- I'm coming.
-  Are you helping
mom get up the stairs?
- I'm coming.
-  (chuckles)
- We're not really going anywhere.
You want me to hold you,
while you're (laughter).
Who's holding who? (laughter)
-  Do you wanna go up?
- I'm getting there, I'm gonna go slow.
- Grab mom's hand.
- We just put away
Christmas and now I'm like--
- Yeah.
All of the trees are finally gone.
I had to show you this,
because I am so dang stinking proud of us
for this organization.
Like, it is ridiculous.
You should have seen
what it was like before,
in fact, I'm kind of upset
that we don't have a before,
but this room was a disaster.
Like, I'm talking everything
was just filled up to here.
But look at what it looks like now.
We organized the crap out of this room.
Like, look.
This is all Christmas right here,
and it's all neat and organized,
and this is all Halloween right here.
All of our costumes and
decorations that we have.
We really, really did a great job,
and I'm proud of myself,
and I'm not trying to be like,
big headed or anything, I'm
just proud because it was a mess
and it was a disaster
and now it looks great.
When we were in St. George,
I was taking a picture of
myself, just as a joke,
and Carl and Ginger took a picture of me
taking a picture,
and they said, I wonder
how long it will take
for Jared to notice.
And I was doing this face, I was going.
It was something like that,
I'll put the picture in here,
and so many people thought
that I looked like Jim Carey
and I was like, oh, that's so funny.
But they said, you look like
Jim Carey as The Grinch.
(laughter) So Ellie--
- Hey, I've always told you
that I thought, in a way,
he reminds me of The Grinch.
- And it's because of my bum.
I guess I have skinny legs and a bum,
and I look like The Grinch
- From behind, like the first time
Jared and I saw each other, I was like,
you look like The Grinch!
-  Yeah.
- And it was so funny,
and people might think that's really mean.
Do you think that's mean?
I thought it was really cute.
- I don't know, I think
it's a little interesting,
a little weird--
- Well, and this.
The Meekum nose, like this of the Meekums.
-  Yeah.
- Their nose and their mouth.
-  Uh-huh.
- Remind me of the Whos a little.
-  (laughs)
- It's cute!
It's cute!
- I'm a grinch, I'm a Who from Whoville.
I don't know, but it's
funny, just the way,
and, because I love Jim Carey,
Jim Carey is one of my
favorite actors of all time,
but his face, just the
whole Grinch face, the.
I don't know, I don't know, I can't do it,
but I thought that was funny.
-  Okay, I'm
gonna turn the vacuum on.
- We're vacuuming everything up.
I like, it feels like something's missing,
like the Christmas tree is gone,
but this is out house now.
-  I love it.
I know I Instagrammed it, but
I don't know if I vlogged it.
Jackson is wearing Calvin's
pants today (chuckles).
That was so silly.
Okay, hold this over here.
-  Okay.
-  I'm gonna pour
some more on there.
Okay, pour that in.
Perfect.
I'm trying another recipe
in the Instant Pot, guys.
We're gonna see how it turns out.
-  And salsa--
-  Okay, dump that in.
-  It's so heavy.
- I know, you're doing good.
I'm getting ready to cook my soup,
I just found a recipe on Pinterest--
-  What's a recipe?
- It tells you what to make.
So I just found a really good recipe.
(blaring harmonica)
There are some that are
not as simple, where it was like
freeze this the night
before, and I was like,
I ant something really easy.
Calvin, do not eat his hair.
So I found this recipe,
it is Lentil Tortilla Soup.
It's a cup of diced onion, a bell pepper,
jalapeno if you want, I didn't do that,
two and a half cups chicken broth,
a can of tomato sauce,
half a cup of salsa, a
table spoon tomato paste,
black beans, pinto beans, corn,
dried lentils, chili
powder, garlic powder,
cumin, whatever other seasoning you want,
and then after you cook it
you just add some heavy cream
and then it's done.
I'm excited to try it, it's really easy,
you pretty much everything at home anyway,
except maybe a bell pepper and an onion,
which is what I just needed
to grab at the store today.
So I had everything.
I used all of out lentils.
I used to make tons of
lentil stuff in the summer
cause I would a lot of what
The Healthy Grocer Girl,
what she would post.
She'd post tons of fun stuff like that,
and I just had stopped cooking lentils,
but that's what it called for.
So we're gonna see how long,
I don't even know how long
it goes for, let me look.
High pressure for 15 minutes,
walk away, freedom, and
then allow natural release,
and then you're done.
So, 15 minutes.
That's it.
(screams) Hope it's good.
-  (mumbles) will be!
-  If it's not we're getting pizza!
-  Woo!
- It's gonna be good (laughs).
Does anybody else just sit and stare?
I mean, how many of you
have an Instant Pot?
And how many of you like
it or don't like it?
I've been sitting here
the whole time (laughs)
just staring at it.
And the pressure just
released so I'm assuming
it's gonna be done soon.
I haven't used it enough to like
get to know it.
(whirring)
- There it is with cheese on top,
sour cream and avocado.
We can dip chips in it if we want.
Come here you crazy.
(yelling child)
Hey!
Go get Jackson, say time to eat!
You blowing on it?
- Yeah, it's hot.
-  It's hot?
Thoughts, Mister?
Do you like it?
Did you eat just the chip or
did you eat the other food?
- I ate chip and more food.
- Okay (chuckles) let's
see you take another bite.
Calvin, I put chips in your soup.
Jackson likes it, let's
see what you think.
Let's see what mom thinks.
Do you guys like this?
Do you like seeing what we make?
I enjoy vlogging dinner and what we make,
because I always want
to see what other people
are eating and making.
Thoughts?
- Hot.
- It is hot.
Good girl, Penny.
-  It's good.
- She's been very good today.
Some days you're not, some
days you're like a toddler.
-  You like it?
- Literally, we have three toddlers.
Four now with little baby.
Mmm.
Mhmmm.
- Mhmmm.
-  And mine's even
better because it has sour cream
and avocado and cheese in it.
- Mmmhmm.
- I love it.
This is very, very good, guys.
Yay.
Thanks for my Instant pot.
- You're welcome.
- Seriously, not every
dinner goes this smooth.
Penny, you have been so good.
She's been good all day, like,
there are some days where
we are like, (screams).
(laughs)
Sometimes we don't film a lot with her
being around, because
it's like we're teaching
and training her, it's like so much work--
- Well, she knows when
we have the camera out,
she'll start--
- Oh, she get's--
- Hyper when the camera's out.
So we're treating her and rewarding her--
-  For just being so good.
- She needs to learn that
it's okay do this kinda stuff.
- Like, the kids have been
playing and petting her,
I just took a bajillion
photos of Calvin and her,
and she's just been so
good, I'm so proud of her.
- She does not always need to be up,
like hyper, that's, it's okay
to just ake a chill pill.
-  Yeah.
-  And she's doing so good.
(mumbling)
-  She scoots off.
- Chill pill!
-  Yeah, chill pill (laughs).
-  Look at her
noble face, I love it.
- Because sometimes the kids
don't just go up and pet her
because she just won't let them,
cause she's just too busy.
But she's like, look, she
just backs up in her place.
Oh, Penny, I'm so proud of you girl.
You've been so nice with the kids.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, that's cute.
(laughs)
I love this.
I hope you guys enjoy this footage,
this is so, like, just us being at home.
Like, Jared takes Penny on a walk everyday
and I'm like you should film that,
I almost get mad, I'm
like, why don't you film
how fun that is?
But he's like, well, it's just repetitive,
and I'm like, um, hello?
I show what I film everyday
for dinner, almost.
So you need to, okay?
- The kids went to bed
so much better tonight,
I think they're gonna
sleep really, really great,
and I'm really excited about it.
They were excited to go to bed.
Hi, are you waiting for me again?
They were excited to go to bed,
and we, oo...
(popping)
are about to go ham
on some snacks.
Ellie and I are gonna watch a movie.
Oh, hot hot hot hot hot hot!
(clattering)
Oh, not in the sink.
Shhh! Jared.
The babies are trying to sleep.
We're gonna go ham on some snacks
and have a wonderful Saturday night.
Today was an awesome day,
it turned out to be awesome,
but it wasn't starting out.
I had some fun plans for
the kids and for Ellie
that we have to postpone
but we will do them soon.
So, all in all, still
a good day even though
it didn't work out the way we wanted.
And that's the best kinda day, right?
Anyway, thanks so much for watching, guys,
if you enjoyed the video
give it a big thumbs up,
make sure you hit that subscribe button,
as well as the notification bell.
There's been things
going around saying that
YouTube only pushes certain
videos when you have
the subscribe button,
but when you have the bell
notification it tells you
every time we put out a video.
Kind of frustrating, I know,
we're still working with
YouTube about these things,
but...
Thank you for doing that.
We appreciate it.
Thanks for sharing with
your friends and family,
and we will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
