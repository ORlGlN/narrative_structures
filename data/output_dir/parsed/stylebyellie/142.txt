- Let us get close together
for this video today.
- Should we just
- Who have you kissed?
- Huh?
That is the discussion today.
We are going to be talking about--
- This is Jared's idea by the way.
- Yeah, I think this is a great idea.
We're gonna be talking
about our first kisses.
Do you remember your first kiss?
- Yes.
- You do, okay good.
Because I'm kind of surprised about that,
because you've had so many first kisses.
What?
Oh, sorry, is that too revealing,
is that too controversial at this time.
- Its okay.
Hey, as long as it's okay with you,
it just happened.
- You know I think you
are my last first kiss.
(bell dings)
- Well I've very happy to say
that that's the same with you.
- Is is?
- Yes.
(laughing)
- So I thought it would be fun
to talk about our very first kisses
and the experience we had
and what it was like,
and if you liked it or you didn't like it,
or if there were any kisses that you had
that you just didn't
really like, so go ahead.
- I think for me, I
would rather just share
the most awkward kiss I have ever had
in my entire life.
- I want to hear that story.
- I think that's the one
- that I would like to share.
- Okay.
- You start first this is your video.
- Sure okay,
- Whatever you want to
share, lay it out there.
- I'm gonna lay it all out there.
So I was dating this girl,
which it's funny, because one,
she's probably watching this video,
two, you guys are like
really good friends now,
so it's almost like weird for me,
but it's not, because I
honestly think she's awesome.
- She is,
- Like she's so so wonderful.
- Jared's old first real girlfriend
- My first real girlfriend, yeah.
- is now really good friends with me.
(laughing)
And it's not weird
- No it's not.
- Your family really
likes her, I like her.
I text her
- All the time.
- All the time,
- like we text all the time
and she's actually moving,
and I cannot wait
To hang out.
- She's moving to Utah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Well no, we love her,
our family loves her,
so it's kinda cool,
- Yeah.
- it's kinda fun,
but I'm gonna tell you
about our very first kiss.
- Okay, lay it out there,
how old were you?
- I'm trying to make sure
I'm not mixing up two stories.
But I might make up the two stories.
Or I might miss the two stories.
I'm not gonna make 'em up,
(laughing)
this is good enough as it is.
So I was 16 years old, okay?
- Okay.
- I was 16 when I had my very first kiss,
which is not to be ashamed of,
that's totally fine.
I was with my buddy and
he was older than me.
No maybe I was 15, because I didn't have
my driver's license, or maybe he was just
driving us around, because
I didn't have a car.
Both are very true.
So we, after a stake
dance, which is a dance
where all of the kids
- a church dance
- in the church area get together
and it's like this big get together
hang out, it's a lot of fun.
After that, we hung out,
and then my buddy was taking me
and my girlfriend a the time home.
There was me, my girlfriend at the time,
my buddy, and I think
there was another girl
in the car too.
So we were driving home
and it was in my front yard,
like my driveway.
We got out of the car and obviously
we'd been dating for awhile now,
and like I was anticipating,
we were both anticipating
this very first kiss.
And my buddy cranked up the music,
his name's Matt.
He's so funny, like he's so funny.
He cranked up the music
and guess what he played?
- What?
- Little Mermaid's Kiss the Girl.
- Awww, that was cute.
- And he rolls down the window,
he rolls the window down and he says,
♫ There you see her.
♫ Do do do do do do do
- I've never heard this.
- So it was funny,
- because we had all been talking
about this first kiss,
and that it's just never happened yet,
and so we laughed and we
just looked at each other
and then we kissed.
- Cute.
- And it was a very very sweet kiss.
- Oh that's cute.
- Yeah, it was really fun.
- I've never heard that story.
- No actually, all of that is true,
except it wasn't at my house,
it was at her house.
It was at her house.
- Okay.
- I mean it's so long ago,
it's hard to remember.
- Yeah, this is more than
10 years ago, holy crap.
The one at my house
was our first make out.
(gasps)
- On the couch?
- No no no, in our driveway.
Very similar experience
and I think my buddy Matt
and that same girl
were in the car while that happened.
(laughing)
I think that's true, so anyway.
- Awww.
- We dated for two, three
years I think in high school.
- Exclusively?
- Mmm-hmm.
- So you didn't date other girls?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Did you go on single dates with her,
did it have to be a group date.
- No we were always in groups.
Yeah, it was always in groups.
- I always had to be in groups.
There were a few times
where it was single.
I think I was the youngest and it wasn't
(laughing)
- Your parents were like, I don't care.
- For the most part,
I was supposed to be in groups.
And we did a good job of doing that.
I had the worst kissing experience ever.
- Aww.
- It was--
- Please tell me it's not me.
- No.
(laughing)
or else I would not have kids with you.
So I was working at the ice cream shop.
I met a few different boyfriends
at the ice cream shop.
His sister actually asked if I was single
and got my number for her brother.
- That's a good sister.
- It was fun
and they were a really nice family
and I really liked them.
And actually, I liked her,
the other sister was not very nice to me
and I didn't feel very comfortable
and that made me feel bad.
So I'm grateful for nice sister-in-laws.
Because you don't ever want
to feel uncomfortable.
- Right.
- So he asked me out,
and we went on a few dates.
And he was older than me,
and I was younger,
so I thought he obviously likes me
or he wouldn't keep asking me out.
The first few dates
were really consistent.
And then I would always,
like he never texted,
and it was weird because
that was kind of the thing,
like you always were texting.
He never texted.
I think one time I texted him and said,
hey, thanks for the fun date
and I never heard anything back
and I was like, okay well,
I'll just not text him,
it was weird.
- Yeah.
- But he called me at 10 at night
and he's like, put your prom dress on
and we're gonna all go hang out.
- What?
- It was really weird
and even my mom, I remember her face,
she was kinda wondering
if she should tell me
not to go.
I think she kinda didn't want me to go
but she let me.
- Yeah.
It was a group,
and so we ended up putting
our prom dresses on.
He's like out of high school, by the way.
And we just made a fun date out of it.
It was fun, we had fun,
we drove around town,
I think we grabbed food,
went to their house and watched a movie.
But it was really weird like--
- And this is not prom night.
- No, and we were watching a movie
and I knew he wanted to kiss me
and so we went to kiss,
but it was awkward.
I was just like, are you
even wanting to kiss,
like he's the one that kissed me,
but it was just like
- Like what I did at the beginning.
- It was so weird, yeah, just exactly
what he did at the beginning of the video.
It was so weird.
And then I was like, well okay,
and usually once you kiss someone,
every time you see them,
- You do a greeting kiss.
- on a date,
- you'll kiss once,
- Yeah.
- at least at the end of the night.
- Right.
- And so we went out on a few more dates
and he didn't kiss me,
and I was like, well that's weird.
And then one night, he did kiss me.
I was like, oh my gosh, he kissed me.
And then again, not, and I was like
this is the weirdest guy.
- I think I know his strategy here.
He's thinking I'm gonna kiss her
in the most awkward situations
in the most awkwardly way possible.
- And then the very last
time that we kissed,
he had brought me soup,
because I went home from work sick,
which again, if he didn't like me,
- He wouldn't have done it.
- He wouldn't have done it.
And I though oh that's really nice.
It's not like I was sick,
I just was like, I don't know,
maybe that's why he
didn't want to kiss me,
because he thought I was sick.
- Well yeah, I don't think you probably
want to kiss when you're,
well maybe you're just like
- You would've kissed me
no matter what.
- I totally would have.
- Because my thinking on that,
is like, I don't care,
I'm gonna kiss you because I love you.
- And so I went to kiss him,
and it was the weirdest thing.
- Did he go like?
- Oh he totally was like
and I was like, nevermind,
it was so awkward.
I was like, I think we're done.
And I think we went on
one other date after that.
And then he moved for college.
And I was like, that was weird.
- Yeah.
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah, I've never really had
a bad experience with kissing.
I've kissed like four girls before we met
and got married and everything
and none of them were like bad kisses,
I never had a really bad experience.
So I don't have anything that tops that.
- I had one other that
was really weird too,
the last one.
- I think with how many
guys you've kissed,
you're bound to have
a couple bad (laughs).
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- I think I only kissed him twice
and we didn't kiss anymore.
But I just thought,
I don't think this is how you're supposed
to like make out.
- Yeah.
- I think he just went,
and shoved his tongue
in my throat and I was like (gagging).
- Yeah, that's weird.
- I literally went like that,
I went like (gagging),
like what are you doing?
- Well and my thinking is,
it's not that difficult.
I don't know how people can
be like really bad kissers.
- Weird kissers.
- Yeah.
- Which I guess I should say that
with the caveat,
I only know that Ellie has told me
that I'm not a bad kisser.
I don't know what the other girls
have thought about me kissing, so.
- Jared's a good kisser
and he's really nice.
You took forever to kiss me.
- I did, should we talk
about our first kiss?
- I think we have before.
- Let's talk about it now.
- Sure.
- I told Jared's friend
that I was a little
disappointed that he didn't kiss me,
because Valentine's came and gone
and he didn't kiss me.
- I did not kiss her on Valentine's Day.
- So it was the day after Valentine's
that Jared kissed me.
- Well it's not because I
didn't want to kiss you,
because of Valentine's Day.
Of course I wanted to kiss you.
The reason why it took me a long time
to kiss you, is because I wanted
to take things slow,
- See?
- I really did.
- I know.
- Because a couple of my relationships
progressed really fast
and crashed and burned
and I did not want that
to happen with you.
And I said, I want this
to go really really well,
so I'm going to take my time
and not base things off
of physical feelings
and do more outside of that.
- You're cute.
- So kissing, while it's very very fun,
and kissing is not a contract.
That's a Flight of the
Conchords restaurant, reference.
I wanted it to be more than
just physical attraction,
and kissing and everything,
so I waited and I got to know you
and fell in love with you,
before I fell in love with your lips.
You know, that's profound.
- Yeah and then when he went to kiss me,
I turned my head.
- I remember that, I was like what the?
Maybe I did wait too long.
- I think I was just a little nervous.
And I think it just happened,
I really did not purposely try to be
a brat or, I think it just
happened, and I was like
- And it wasn't like
that was the end of it.
You turned your cheek and
then you went in for it,
just right after it.
So at first, I was like (gasps), ahh.
(laughs)
So that leaves us with a question,
what are your first kiss experiences like?
Do you have some amazing ones?
Do you have some terrible ones?

experiences have been like
