full good-morning guys I hope you're
having a good day I recently found out
that the average person takes about six
thousand steps a day and I think that
just sounds like a lot I think six
thousand sounds like a lot but I feel
like we take more than that especially
with the to kit let's get the kids okay
let's go about our day okay and we'll
see how many steps we take
sounds like a point challenge accepted
say Jackson come here yes you're coming
