- It looks like it's getting worse.
-  Your mole?
- Do you think there's
a zit under my mole?
-  Is that possible?
- I don't even know.
I just turned on the
camera and I was like,
my face looks worse than it did yesterday.
(coughing)
We're so happy to have Jared home.
- Woo ooh!
Party when Dad is home.
Party when Dad is home,
party when Daddy's home.
Aww.
-  Don't hit.
- I'm leaving.
- Jared is editing.
I'm sitting here eating breakfast
and Mr. Calvin, of course,
follows me wherever I go.
- Ah!
-  Take a bite.
- Ah!
-  You want a bite?
(Jared mock gobbling)
(Laughs)
- So he can get his second breakfast.
You ate right when you woke up,
but mow you want more, huh?
-  Haven't you ever
heard of second breakfast Ellie?
- Oh yeah, hello I'm pregnant.
-  Don't show me, because
my offices is really dirty.
- It's okay.
Hi Calverino.
(Jared laughing)
(laughs)
Jackson just brought me this picture.
This is a picture of me at church
when I was going into
Sunbeams just like Jackson is.
You're my baby boy.
You are so cute.
Did you see that and wonder
why Mommy was so little?
- Mmm-hmm.
-  He's like Mom,
why were you so little?
- Why are you wearing these?
-  Because I was a goofball
and wore my regular shoes.
- Why were you wearing these white things?
- Those were my tights to keep me warm.
That was my favorite
dress, I still have it.
I have it folded up.
I only have two childhood clothing items
and that's one of them.
Why are you being goofy?
Okay guys I know I just
talked about my skin,
but I feel like it's getting worse.
Look at this half of my
face looks pretty good,
this half of my face, look,
look at everything.
(laughs)
Pregnancy does weird things to your body,
weird things to your hormones.
La la la oh that's my lipstick.
- La la la la la--
- You keep finding stuff under there.
Pregnancy does some weird stuff to you
and I do have an appointment set up
for a dermatology appointment
to look at this specifically.
This is a zit, that's a bad zit,
but this, you can just see around it,
I haven't touched it,
but around it is weird.
This is not a zit, I don't
even know what that is.
I seriously just kind
of look like a hot mess
and I'm hoping everything is good,
but that's just crazy,
because Bonnie had the
cancer spot removed,
my Dad had a cancer spot removed.
I can't remember if Bonnie's
was cancerous or pre-cancerous.
Jared's dad had a cancerous spot removed.
So that's why I'm like,
that is just weird.
Thank you and the horse,
can you put it in your bucket?
Go put it away, thank you.
Prefect.
Good job.
I'm not getting ready
today, because Bonnie called
and she's like oh--
that's a marble, thank you.
(laughs)
He's finding stuff under the couch.
Bonnie's coming over today, she's like,
what are you guys doing today?
I was like, nothing we want to take Penny
up on a walk, up on the mountain,
just kinda hanging out
but not really any plans.
And she's like can we
come get in your hot tub,
she's like, my kids want
to get out of the house.
And I don't want Jackson to hear,
because I just want him to be surprised
when they come over.
But they're gonna come over,
we're gonna get a lunch,
we're gonna get in the hot tub,
we're gonna hang out
and it's gonna be a fun Saturday.
Jared is editing the vlog from,
is it two days ago Jared?
- Yes, CES day one.
- CES day one?
And in that vlog, you
can see that this spot
is just a freckle.
It's just a freckle.
And then in a matter of a day and a half,
it went from a freckle
to an inflamed mole, weird.
Okay, you guys are probably done
hearing me talk about this,
but it's just part of my life right now
and it's crazy.
Okay, let's get ready.
Let's get ready for our
cousins to come over, okay?
Hello.
- Ready to party.
- Hi Jackson, we brought our swim suits.
- Hi.
- Yay!
- We're here and we're
ready for the hot tub.
-  Bon, Happy Saturday.
-  Happy Saturday.
-  I wasn't gonna tell Jackson
and Jared was like, Jackson was like,
can we get in the hot tub?
And Jared's like we gotta
wait for our cousins
I'm like, why did you say that?
- I had no idea.
I've been in my office all morning.
-  Hi Link.
-  Ellie was like
look at your outfit.
(Bonnie laughs)
-  Did you like your trip?
- I did, thank you so much for asking.
- Are you guys starving?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- So frigging hungry.
- I'm sorry.
-  There's no way that's a mole.
-  It is, look at it.
- Pardon me, but do you happen
to have any Grey Poupon?
(laughing)
-  What is this?
- Not poo poo, Poupon.
Not even pupa, Poupon.
- Oh my gosh.
- I really want to do a video
where we do dad jokes.
Where you fill your mouth with water,
and then we do dad jokes
and we try to see who can not laugh.
The try not to laugh challenge.
- That would be so fun.
-  We should do that.
(funky atmospheric music)
(funky atmospheric music)
Okay Penny, you've got a ball,
but you want this one more.
You ready for this?
You ready for this?
One

(Jared laughs)
She's trying to get both in her mouth,
there we go, good girl.
Woo.
- I want to throw something for her.
-  Okay, that's a great idea.
Here's her football.
Are you ready to throw it?
- Wait, this one's slobbery.
-  Oh it's wet from the snow.
Can you do it?
Okay throw it as hard as you can,
like a football.
Ready set go!
(Jared laughs)
Did you have so much fun
in the hot tub today with your cousins?
- Uh-huh.
-  Yeah, okay I got this ball,

want to throw it from there?
- Yep.
-  Okay.
Go!
- One two three!
- Woo, good throw bud.
Okay watch this bud.

so incredible, you will
not even believe your eyes.
Okay?
- Okay.
-  Okay, you ready?
-  Yeah.
-  Here we go Penny.
Here we go.
Boom!
-  How did you do that?
- I'm magical.
-  You're not magical.
- You're right.
-  You're not too magical.
- You are too strong
for your own good Penny.
(yells)
(grunts)
Whoa (laughs) woo.
(bright music)
Ready set go.
- Wow.
- You are running me out of energy.
You just have so much energy,
I can't even keep up,
but maybe I'll be able to.
Sneak attack!
No she's too quick, she's too quick,
I can't keep up.
- I'm helping him do this.
- You're so fast.
- Ah ah ah!
(Jared laughs)
(Jackson grunting)
Whoa ooh!
Is that eight seconds,
ladies and gentlemen?
Did he get it at eight
seconds on the clock?
We will find out if he is the winner
of the championship tonight.
(Jared laughs)
Were you getting on
Penny like a bull rider?
Or something like that?
- But she's not letting me have it.
-  Do you want me to get it for ya?
- Yes.
- Okay, I'll do my best, but she's tough.
Okay, she's tough.
It's Saturday and that
means it's date night.
We're going to see The Greatest Showman.
I just got off the phone with Dan Markham
from What's Inside not too long ago.
And he's seeing it for
the second time today
and he said it was amazing.
- In one day?
- No I just think second time overall,
but he was--
- I got lots of snacks.
- Yeah we got snacks
proving we haven't had dinner yet.
But he was saying that so
many people in the theater
were seeing it like the third, fourth time
since it's came out.
So even better than Star
Wars and everything.
Hi how are you?
-  I've seen you before.
-  Do you have our tickets?
- Did you go to the bathroom?
- Yeah.
So I'm really excited to see this movie.
We've got all the goodies
and Bonnie and Joel are grabbing theirs.
We're going in the theater
because it's packed, it is jam packed.
♪ Whoa ♪
(dramatic music)
♪ Ladies and gents, this is
the moment you've waited for. ♪
- Holy freakin' crap.
- I've never gone to a movie twice,
but that would be worth to go again.
- The Greatest Showman
was so incredibly good.
Joel, where did you park?
(laughing)
Hey, you guys are just
copying what we did.
- What?
- Seriously, so--
- Where's your car?
- Dan said this is the
second or third time
he's seen this movie.
And I was like, man that--
- It must be really good.
- He must really like it.
- And holy crap.
- I can see why.
- I can totally see why.
And this is one of those movies
I said the last time when
we saw was like Star Wars,
or something like, ooh
careful guys, jeepers.
(laughing)
- Who claps at the movie?
- Yeah, there was applause
at the end of this movie,
but I always want to be
in these superhero movies,
and be the superhero,
but it's like, no I
want to join the circus!
I want to join the circus!
- You can be the bearded lady.
- Yeah, wait, it was so good.
- It was amazing.
-  So good.
- I liked the applause.
- Yeah, I'm hyped up.
- What was the quote at
the end of the movie?
- The noblest art is that
of making others happy.
-  I love that.
- I love that and I hope
we do that too sometimes.
Let's make out in the back.
Thanks for watching guys.
(laughing)
Have a wonderful day,
thanks guys, okay bye.
