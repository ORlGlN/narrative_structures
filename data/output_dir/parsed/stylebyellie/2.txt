- Pregnancy brain at it's finest.
- Dang that was a cool
scene, we were just--
- I know!
- Aw man, do you know what that means?
- I love you buddy.
- Love you.
-  Okay, so all of
his dogs and dog blankets
were right here and then
he's like "errrr, no!"
Okay, you're putting them all right here.
I got it. I see!
I see it now.
I see the inspiration.
Now you and Mommy and
Calvin are going to do
some fun stuff today and I need you
to be Mommy's helper, okay?
If Calvin's like "No
I don't wanna do that"
you say "Calvin we're gonna
be Mommy's helpers today
and we're gonna be good for Mommy."
Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Good, I love you.
I love you so much!
(laughs)
Oh I got one!
I got one where you wiped away.
You know what Grandma always says?
You can wipe away the kiss
but you can't wipe away the love.
(laughs)
You can wipe away the kiss
but you can't wipe away the love.
(big kiss)
I'm gonna try and kiss you!
I'm gonna get you.
(kids laughing and squealing)
You're so fast!
(kids laughing and squealing)
Gotcha!
(laughter)
-  Got you!
-  Thanks Calvin,
you're a good helper.
(laughing)
- Don't wipe away my kiss!
- The kids and I are in
town and we are going
to try and find something
extra special today.
Do you remember what
we're gonna find, Jax?
- Baby car seat.
-  What is it?
- Baby car seat.
- A baby car seat!
- Excuse me, sir.
I'm supposed to be doing that to you.
- No, I'm supposed to doing it to you.
- All right, whoever
spots the car seats first
gets to choose the treat.
(laughing)
You know where my mind is.
It's always treats.
Can we find a car seat?
Calverooni, can we find a car seat?
-  Hello.
You got your RC car?
- You wanna play?
-  Yeah, mine's in the trunk.
- Ha ha.
- Guys! It's time for another segment
of "Joel and Jared go on a date."
Before we go on our man-date
we had to make one stop.
Ahem, queue the music.
♪ Joel and Jared go to Maverik. ♪
- Should we toast our burritos?
- Boop
- Toast 'em.
- Delicious.
- Clinky.
- Okay, seat belts?
Check.
Safety first, ladies and gents.
-  Do you see 'em?
- Yeah!
-  Right here!
All right, looking at car
seats can be overwhelming.
We don't have an infant car seat anymore.
We always used the Graco Click Connect.
I think this is the one
that we had with the boys
when they were younger but
now that they've gotten
older we've really liked the Chico one.
So I was looking at this infant car seat
but then I saw this one.
This is from Graco and it's says it's new
and it's the only "impact
protection properly positioned
to help protect your growing infant."
But I really did like
this cause I feel like
a lot of times when your
infants are in the carseat
their heads are so everywhere
and I kinda like that this is like
built-in to help protect your baby
as their heads grow so I'm kinda leaning
more towards this one actually.
I just sent a text to Jared
to see if he has an opinion.
But it's kinda between
this one, this Graco
or this Chico one
- (child yelling)
Owie!
Between this one or that one.
So I'm gonna wait to hear back from Jared.
But in the meantime I
did find a little basket
here at Target for the baby
for all of the little toys
and stuff in the corner of the baby room.
I like to have a little basket of toys
which I had one in there for Calvin
but we actually moved
it into the living room.
Now let me go chase my toddlers.
- So the date today is
all about... (groaning)
Jeepers! RC cars.
Brian got me this RC car
for my birthday last year.
Thanks Brian.
But the first ride that
I had it at my house
I crashed it and broke it.
Joel has Cody's RC car...
- Since Christmas.
- And it's broken too.
So our goal today is to get
these fixed at the hobby store.
So there's a Guitar Center right there
and we might sneak in there after.
Joel, you should play the
drums and I'll play the guitar!
- We might have to jam for a second.
- We should!
If you guys didn't know
it, Joel plays the drums.
Or did. Or does. Or did.
Did?
- Did.
- Does today, in just a few minutes.
(energetic guitar music)
(wheels squeaking)
- We just upgraded to
the coolest cart ever.
This will fit more stuff right?
Is that why you went and grabbed it?
(laughing)
They're out of stock but this
is the one we're going to get.
So I'll have to go home and order it.
Dang it, but we at least
we got some other things
we needed, like a basket.
-  That's my cart.
(Ellie laughing)
- Calvin, I said we can
eat it when we buy it okay?
- I wanna take this one out.
- I wanna hold this one.
-  Okay you hold yours,
they got their little snack.
-  Okay Joel.
Here it is, let's see it.
- But I didn't come prepared.
Oh if I must.
(Jared laughing)
(drumming)
-  Yeah!
- I don't know.
(drumming)
-  Um yeah, I'm not prepared.
I haven't played, I
don't know how to do it.
That was amazing.
You know what I think we should do?
- What's that?
- I think we should start a band.
(drum roll and cymbal crashing)
- It's a good idea.
- You want some salad with your chocolate?
(laughing)
That good?
- Mom I didn't record that whole thing.
- The whole thing?
- I hit the record button after
to turn it off and then turn it on.
- I hate it when that happens.
- I know!
- Well you guys look
like you're having fun.
- We did have fun, yeah.
We went down to the RC
store and all that, but--
-  They didn't have my parts.
- Nah, they had my parts
but Joel had to order his.
- Well dang that was a cool scene!
- I know!
- We were just dragging down Main Street.
- We were, yeah!
It was fun.
We saw Mom.
We're looking behind us and
we're like "Is that Mom?"
Like "Is it?"
We could barely tell cause
the sun was reflecting
on your window and we're
like "That is Mom!"
- Well when I first saw
you I thought "Is that Bo?"
(laughing)
I thought "When are you gonna
put some hubcaps on your car?"
- Hey! I've got one I think.
One out of four ain't bad.
Yeah, see one right there.
It's a good hubcap.
It's stayed long.
Okay, you're gonna get your hair cut?
- I am.
- Okay well have fun.
- Can't wait.
- Okay, we'll see you later.
- Bye bye.
- Bye Joel!
Thanks for going on a date with me.
- It was a fun day.
-  Bye Bon!
- We are playing a Surprise
Slides Lightning-Fast game.
This is pretty much like Candy Land but
with race cars is what we're doing.
Oh, you got the flip sign so take
any two pieces and move them.
Yep, switch 'em, there you go.
-  My turn.
Blue!
Who's winning?
-  Me!
-  Where's your guy?
You're holding your guy! (laughs)
- Red!
-  Red? You got red? Let's see.
- I'm almost to the finish line!
-  You did get red.
Okay where's the red square?
- (screams)
-  He is screaming and then
telling his dog not to scream (laughs)
- (screams) No screaming dog.
-  Good I'm glad
you told him not to scream.
- No.
- Hi puppy! Aww.
Can I give you a kiss puppy?
Oh he's going to bed?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
-  Hi! Did you guys have fun?
- We did.
We'll have to order the car seat.
-  Oh no!
- Wasn't in stock.
-  Darn it.
- I like that one a lot.
- Here's the cars Mom.
- My head hurts.
What?
- Here's the cars.
- The cars?
-  Cool. We had
fun on our man-date.
- Oh did you?
- Did you guys go eat?
-  We did.
- The kids and I went to Zupa's.
-  Aww, fun.
- They ate chocolate
strawberries and salad.
- And Kinder eggs!
-  Oh my goodness!
Did you guys have fun with Mom?
- And eggs!
-  Were you good for Mommy?
- Yep.
-  Were you good boys?
- Yep.
-  Calvin were you good for Mommy?
- Yeah.
- You were very good
or I would not have let
you got a treat, huh?
- Good.
That is so good to hear.
I'm so happy.
- I like going in town when it's like..
I mean, it's fun when we
all go but when it's just me
and the boys I have a lot of fun.
- Good, yeah it's a lot of
fun without Dad isn't it?
- Sometimes it's different
cause it's just me
and it's like...
-  Special time.
- It's fun.
-  Yeah it is, for sure.
I love my family.
- Love you.
(gentle soothing music)
-  Bye Grandma.
- Bye bye!
-  Bye bye Grandma!
- Bye Grandma!
- Bye!!
- That was such a fun
surprise seeing my mom today.
I just had a really good evening.
We all went out to dinner with my friend
but I wanna show you guys...
Do you remember the other day in the vlog
where Jackson was looking at
baby brother's little jammy
and he was confused on
why the feet were enclosed
and then he said he wanted
to find a jammy like that.
When we were at Target
today we saw some and I told
Jackson to pick out a pair of
jammies that had feet in them.
And so these are the
ones that he picked out.
And these are the ones
that Calvin picked out.
-  And more of me.
- Huh?
-  And more of mine.
- And more of yours?
They came in a set of two.
The moment I got Calvin's on Jackson goes
"Oh, he's cute in those." (laughs)
Okay, let's see how they fit.
Oh these beat your
winter jammies for sure.
Do you want me to help?
Okay let's see.
Whoa!
Jackson you look awesome.
How fun! You haven't
worn jammies like that
since you were really little.
But you really wanted to
get some feeted pajammies.
(laughs)
- Oh my goodness gracious.
Look at your new pajamas,
they look so good on you boys.
Do you like 'em?
What do you say ohhh...who got 'em for ya?
(Calvin yells)
- Mom did.
- Mom did, that's so fun.
Okay now listen, here's the deal.
Here's the deal, I have a deal
to make for you guys okay?
(laughs)
We have to go to bed at a good time.
- No!
- Yes.
- No, no! (laughs)
Because I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow we're gonna wake up.
We're gonna get ready for the day
and we're gonna go on an airplane
- No!
- To a special place.
Shh, don't say where it is.
Don't say where it is.
I know you want to but we can't
cause it's a surprise okay?
We need to get some sleep so we can get
on the airplane and go okay?
Sound good?
Give me a thumbs up.
I love you buddy..
- Love you.
- Good night.
- Can (mumbles)...
- Well I'm gonna go get him and I'm gonna
make sure he gets back in bed.
That's the opposite of
what I told you to do.
- I'm gonna go with you.
- You stay right here and
make sure the bed stays okay?
I don't want the bed
getting up and walking away
cause you need to sleep on it.
- No, no.
Beds are fake.
- What do you mean?
The bed could get up and walk away,
you've gotta make sure and you stay
so it doesn't get away okay?
- No.
- Yeah, do that for Daddy.
Do that for Daddy while I get Calvin okay?
(kids laughing)
- Weee!
(kids laughing)
- I know we should go to bed
- We're not.
- But I think we're gonna
continue our ritual of...
We'll just do one show, okay?
Just one show.
And that one show may turn into two shows.
(Ellie laughs)
But that's all.
And then it may be three, I don't know.
- Got my strawberries.
- I think we'll end there.
- That's my favorite fruit.
Did you say we're gonna
end there? (laughs)
- No, I think we're gonna
end all three shows--
- They're like "Hey,
good bye guys." (laughs)
- Sudden ending (bumps camera)
- Thank you guys for watching.
I cannot wait to order the car seat.
- Yeah, I'm excited about that.
I can't wait to go on
an adventure tomorrow.
- Tomorrow. So excited.
And thanks for my sweet mom
for stopping by just to say hi.
- It was a really sweet
moment you guys had.
- I loved it.
I know I looked up and
you were filming it!
I was like "Hey you sneaky".
- Sneaky dog.
Have a wonderful night guys.
If you enjoyed the video
give it a big thumbs up
and we will see you next time
as we embark on a brand new adventure.
Bye!
