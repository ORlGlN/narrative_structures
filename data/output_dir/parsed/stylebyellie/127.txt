- Alright.
(laughs)
I ran and grabbed the camera.
It is five in the morning
and I am so mad at myself,
I've been up since one, cannot sleep.
And I don't know if it's jet lag or not,
I don't think it is,
because it's like day five.
And I haven't done this
once, I can't imagine it
yeah, I don't know if
it's really it or not,
but I can't sleep at all.
Calvin just woke up and I'm proud of him,
because he just said he needed to go poop.
Are you going?
-  Yeah.
- Are you done?
My screen looks funny, big white teeth.
I'm so proud of him.
So instead of being
mad, I'm gonna be happy.
And we're all gonna take naps later.
(Ellie laughs)
You are doing so good.
- Huh.
-  I'm proud of you.
- Puff chit chit puff.
-  It just happens.
- Yeah.
- Good morning, I am here
with a special buddy of mine
and we are working on a few things today
and I want to show you
what we've been practicing.
Hi Penny, how are you?
We've been working on loose leash walking.
Just so it's so much easier
for her to walk around
and we've had some good success
and some not so good success.
So I'm hoping that what I show you,
is the positive side of it.
(bright music)
Okay, are you ready to rock and roll?
Should we start?
Let's start really slowly, okay?
Okay.
Good girl.
See how loose that is, that's so great.
I don't have anything in my hand.
You just stay right there,
we're not pulling, good.
That's a good girl Penny.
You only get as much as I have, op,
okay, so now you pulled a little bit,
we're gonna come this way.
And we'll come back here,
and we'll sit, good girl.
Okay, let's try again.
Good girl.
So what we're practicing now
might be the hardest thing
that Penny has to deal with.
(barking)
We are walking past a neighbor's house
who has a dog, you can
hear the dog barking.
And the whole point of this exercise
is that Penny does not
proceed with her walk
while she's pulling.
If she pulls, we go back to the beginning
and we progressively go,
until she's loose leash
walking all the way past
the dog who's barking.
So this is tough for Penny
because she loves dogs, oh, see?
So we go back a little bit further,
we go back further and we start
from the beginning, loose leash,
and then the further she can loose leash,
the better, the more we go,
the more she's rewarded with
walking with a loose leash.
So here we go, you ready?
Let's go.
Oh okay there we go, let's
start at the beginning.
Good girl.
Oh okay, let's start over.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Let's try again.
Easy.
Nope, okay.
Nope.
So you can see this is
very difficult for her,
which is why we're working on it.
So a day at a time at this,
she'll be good in no time.
Alright Penny, let's go home.
Come on (clicks tongue).
Yes, good girl, that's a
good girl, look at that.
Standing right next to me,
checking in every once in a while.
Yes, good girl.
That's a good girl.
(music on radio)
(laughing)
You were doing good Jackson, keep singing.
He was singing to this song.
He was doing the
♪ I had a dream da da ♪
He was singing that.
Like our little boy singing,
that's so cute, he knows the words
to the song on the radio,
but as soon as the camera came on,
he's like no no no.
What a cutie.
We're going over to my parents house
right now to visit them.
You might want to keep
driving, so we hear him.
(laughing)
You caught me.
- What happened to Grandpa's eye.
-  I had a thing that
he had to cut out of my face.
- What was it?
-  It's called cancer.
- Oh.
What does cancer mean?
- Cancer means that something is growing
on your face that shouldn't grow there.
- Oh.
- So the doctor got it off.
-  Hi.
-  And then he cut it open.
(Calvin vocalizing)
- Yeah, I have an owie on my face, huh?
- Ooh.
- Oh.
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah.
He's like.
- Are you okay?
-  Yep, I'm doing great.
- That's good, well I'm glad to hear it.
So my dad had skin cancer,
and I don't know if we showed before,
but he was wearing a little bandaid here
for awhile, and that's
where the skin cancer was
and he went in for surgery today
and they removed it,
and I guess, the longest
part of the procedure
was seeing if they removed everything.
But apparently the news is that
- They got it all.
-  Oh good, so you
are cancer free right now.
- That is correct.
- When you were talking, I can't remember
you just said it, did he mention anything
about it growing back?
- No he didn't, no he didn't say that.
-  So there's a chance
that it could grow back.
- You know, I'm of the skin type
that is very susceptible to skin cancer.
-  Which is like the fair skin,
blonde hair, blue eyes.
- Right, right.
- Dad had his procedure today,
but everything looks like
it's going really well.
It's crazy that, you know,
this has never been
something I've thought about,
like cancer in our family.
Like on my side, we don't have
a lot of people with cancer,
so when we heard Dad did have cancer,
like that's nerve wracking a little bit.
- Yeah it was a little scary.
-  Yeah.
- I was a little worried.
- It's something that
we have to worry about,
because your dad had some skin cancer,
Bonnie had pre skin cancer.
So it almost makes me like, okay we got
to make a dermatology
appointment, just to make sure.
Well I'm glad you're feeling better
or at least, you're gonna feel better.
- Yeah yeah.
-  I don't think
you feel all that great.
- Plus I'll have a huge scar
and I'll make up some really good stories
to tell about it.
-  Oh and then
I can call you two face
or even just Scar like The Lion King.
- Scarface.
- Scarface, yeah.
I think one thing that
surprised me the most
was that Dad did have that
tiny little bandaid on,
and the skin cancer didn't appear
bigger than that tiny little bandaid,
- Correct.
- But the scar that is there,
is the size of that bandage.
I have a picture,
warning, it's a big scar.
So, careful, but I'll show it.
All the way down Dad's face,
and it's pretty intense,
but they had to do that
to get all the cancer.
- Right.
- I mean that's crazy.
- And not only to get the Cancer,
but then to make something
that they could sow up
and reduce the scarring.
- It's just because of your
skin type, just because of the--
- Well yeah, I'm more susceptible.
- Yeah.
- If I would've worn
sunscreen my whole life.
- Okay, so sun scream would've helped
- Yeah.
-  in this situation.
- Yeah, it would've, but you know,
when you're growing up, back at the time
that I grew up, sunscreen
wasn't even a thing.
-  Yeah.
- Shade wasn't even a thing.
(laughing)
- You had to work in 90 degree heat
with sun blazing even
during the wintertime,
that's what it was like.
And then in the wintertime
you walked uphill both ways in the snow
-  That's right.
- to school.
-  That's right.
- I hope you feel better.
- Aw, thank you.
(laughing)
(thud)
- (gasps) oh.
- Oh.
- You okay?
- Is your foot okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay, so this is their
favorite thing to do,
is to jump.
Okay, so I got my Christmas onesie on
and Jackson saw it and goes,
you have a Christmas jammie?
And he was so excited I said,
maybe next week we can go as a family
to the store and we can all pick out
Christmas jammies together.
And Grandma I noticed,
Grandma bought this for you.
That is so and warm.
Did you tell her thank you?
- Fox!
Thank you Grandma.
-  That was so nice of her.
You look so cozy and warm.
Okay go jump.
So Jared and I, we just
got our fall winter
merch that's up on Teespring right now.
We have some really fun designs,
some really funny Christmas sweaters,
ugly Christmas sweaters
I guess you could say.
They're really cute, I hope you like them,
but for those of you that are interested,
we'll have that in the description.
But right now, we have
a little family activity
we want to do that I've been
wanting to do for a minute,
but we're gonna do it now.
We have the paper,
and we have, upstairs in
the pantry is those markers.
-  I was gonna say, we
need something to write with.
- Yeah, I'll go grab 'em.
Every year, Halloween, the holidays,
Thanksgiving, then Christmas,
it comes and then it goes so fast
and I have learned that if
I do not write things down
and I actually prepare my month out,
I don't do everything
that I really want to do.
And so tonight, I told Jared,
I thought it would be fun to make a list
of a bunch of things we want to do.
Go see a few movies, go ice skating,
go do a few crafts with the kids.
There's a lot of things that I want to do,
and I feel like if I don't write it down
and have a check list, I won't do it all.
And even at Halloween, I wanted to watch
so many more movies with the kids,
like certain movies,
and I didn't end up watching them.
And it sounds so silly,
but I feel like if I see it,
I'll do it, you know?
- Yeah.
You gotta have a plan.
- I don't know.
- You gotta execute.
- Yeah,
- Execution Ellie.
- Even if you don't do all of them,
at least we'll have some
fun things written down
that we know we want to do.
Like even making cookies,
it comes and goes so fast,
like it's already the end,
we're almost at Thanksgiving
and I kinda want to start a new tradition.
We don't have a whole
ton of traditions yet.
Our kids are just getting to that age
where they're remembering stuff,
it's just more fun to take them out,
because they're enjoying
the experiences more.
And I think that it would
be really fun to set up
the Christmas tree before Thanksgiving,
because I feel like it will bring in
that holiday spirit even more.
And I know there's like a huge thing
like don't skip Thanksgiving
and jump into Christmas,
but I think that it just brings
in that spirit, you know?
- Yeah, throughout the whole time.
You could have the
holiday spirit throughout
all of the holidays.
- Yeah, I just think it would
be pretty to have a tree.
I remember one year my mom,
she didn't have a Christmas tree up,
but she had a few pine
trees that had lights,
and I just remember it
feeling really special.
So I think maybe here in a few days,
we'll do the tree.
We won't decorate it,
we'll just have it up for the lights.
And then we'll decorate
it after Thanksgiving.
- I totally thought you
said the trees had lice.
And I was like those are not trees
that you want to have in your house.
No lice please.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Did you just draw an S?
-  Mmm-mmm.
- Are you gonna trace the
letters like you do at school?
Jackson overheard what we were saying.
And when I went upstairs
to get the markers,
he goes, am I gonna do a
list, a list for Santa?
And I said well yeah if
that's what you want to do.
-  That's so fun.
-  So he's gonna
make a little list.
And we've talked a lot already
about Thanksgiving and giving, huh?
Do you remember those talks?
And we have some fun things
that we are going to be doing,
but think it's really cute
that he wanted to do this.
- That's not a list.
Calvin, that's not a list.
You have to do a list for Santa.
- Jackson,
- Mommy Mommy look.
- what do you want from Santa?
- A remote control race track
with loop-de-loops of
boats and remote cars.
- He's thought about this.
So are you gonna write it down
and we'll mail this to Santa Claus?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Okay, Calvin you make sure to write down
what do you want
What do you want for Christmas?
- Eat.
- You want to eat?
- Yeah.
- I did this one.
- You did an A, good job.
- That looks so good.
-  A, he A.
-  Yeah it is an A.
We got three percent on here so.
That's a wrap.
- This is Jackson's very first letter.
And I had no idea that
this was what we were
gonna do tonight, but it just happened
and it was so cute.
- Because he wanted to do it.
Like how fun is that.
- Yeah.
- That he wanted to
write a letter to Santa.
- And you better believe
that Mama's gonna take
a good picture of this
and keep it forever.
- Dad Dad Dad.
- He has his G's
-  over there from school.
Calvin this is your first
letter too, let's look.
-  Look at this.
- That's so pretty.
- Wow.
- Biggest!
- The biggest.
-  Okay, you did small, medium,
let's go on to the biggest.
- Yeah, I'm gonna start with the S.
-  Okay, I am so proud of you.
You want to hang it up there, Cal?
- Oh my gosh.
Here let me help you buddy.
Let me help ya.
There you go.
- Wow.
- Mine.
(laughing)
-  That looks good.
-  Aww, how sweet is that?
-  And Miss Penny, we
are going to be celebrating
- The one year anniversary
of us bringing you home.
-  When was that, it was just not--
- Was it before or after Thanksgiving.
It was before Thanksgiving.
-  It's not already past, is it?
- I hope not.
-  It might--
- We gotta check the calendar right now.
22nd when we brought her home.
-  Okay.
- Phew that was close.
-  I was like nooo.
- Oh my gosh.
-  I'm gonna write that down.
- Yeah.
Well that is it from us today.
Here are the results of what we did.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
It is time for bed
and I will see you guys next time.
Bye.
