(dramatic groovy music)
-  Is that not the
coolest shirt you have ever seen?
Calvin's gonna wear that.
You have a cool one too.
You have the mummy one.
- Why do I have the mummy one?
- 'Cause that's what you have.
They didn't have your size in this.
We are getting ready for the day.
Calvin is going to have his first official
play date today.
Just him and just kids his age.
Are you excited Cal?
No, that's his personality.
(laughs)
It's no at first.
He doesn't want to leave his brother,
it's cute, or me.
Okay, I gotta grab him,
and get him dressed.
- This is my dress.
This is my dress.
-  He's gonna eat your bum bum.
Calvin, did you sleep in my bed?
- Yeah.
-  You did?
- Yeah.
-  I want you to say something.
- It's so cute.
Lay down, we're not done.
-  You say something.
- This is the cutest outfit.
(crying)
You don't think so?
-  Hi Calvin.
Hi Calvin.
- No.
-  You found the pocket.
Did it eat you?
- Yeah.
-  Did it eat your hand?
-  You tell
something to our friends.
- You want me to say
something to our friends?
Calvin there you go,
look how cute you look.
I like that, should we go
put on your good shirt too?
-  Daddy.
-  Hello.
(laughing)
(drawing blinds)
- Good morning guys,
so I just got out of the
shower as you can tell.
And I noticed something
and I wanted to tell you about it.
I was washing my hair
and I was just using the
cheapo hotel shampoo.
And I was doing my hair and I was like,
oh my gosh, this does not feel
like my hair normally does.
And then I realized it's because
I'm not using the shampoo and conditioner
that Ellie has at home.
Ellie always makes sure,
she's a cosmetologist,
so she makes sure to get the
good stuff for your hair.
And I'm just like running
my fingers through my hair,
and I'm like uh,
and this is the first time
I've made that connection,
it's like wow, good
shampoo and conditioner
actually makes a difference.
So I wanted to take this opportunity
to thank you Ellie,
thank you for not only taking care of me,
but my hair too.
- There are so many scarecrows.
- There are so many scarecrows.
Here show me what you got.
Jackson's my little buddy today.
- I got bubblegum.
- You got your very
fist pack of bubblegum.
I used to remember eating
that in my back yard.
And I put it all in my mouth,
and I had too much to eat.
- I'm not gonna eat too much.
- Okay, you'll eat it slow, okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay well Calvin's at
his little play date.
He did so good, he just went in
and played with his friends.
It's cute, sometimes he
doesn't really want to,
and then sometimes he does really great
and today he did great.
Let's go.
Should we go home?
- Yeah.
(playful music)
-  No pomegranates!
- What do you mean,
we're not gonna get food?
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- I'll go hang out with my dad.
- Hang out with your dad Chaz.
- Okay.
- Have a good time.
See ya buddy.
- Today is the last day of VidSummit
and it has been awesome,
but there's two things that I need to do
before we take off on our airplane today.
Aside from all the classes,
which has been awesome,
there's like an electric scooter here
that's kind of like a snowboard,
and I need to ride that.
I've seen people ride it
and it's been amazing.
Also, number two, Garrett
from the Bucket List family
is here, he's speaking today.
And for the past year or so,
we have been talking
about getting together
and meeting up and we've never been able
to make anything work,
but we finally, I think
we're gonna be able
to talk today.
Oh look hey, hi how's it going?
(laughing)
I love those guys, that's
Jake Larsen and his wife.
But I think we're
finally gonna meet today,
and maybe we'll talk about
doing something together.
I don't know, we'll see.
- Mr. Calvin, did you have fun?
Mr. Nosepicker?
Did you have fun?
- Yeah.
- Did you dance?
And did you sing?
Wow.
My friend said that he was rocking out
with the music.
And then they made these.
I'm so glad you had a
fun little play date.
- Can I have one of those Calvin?
-  You want one too?
We could share.
He has a treat that he
could share with you.
And you can share with him.
We need to wash our hands.
Sometimes we pick our noses,
and if you just wash your
hands, that's okay right?
We need to learn to not do that,
he's gotten in the habit.
- Okay I found the scooter,
but not only that, I found the creator,
the owner, the most amazing
person in the world.
Hey, how's it going.
- Hi.
- So this is the scooter
and you're gonna tell us
a little bit about it.
- Yes, this is the Scooterboard.
It's not a scooter, it's not a skateboard,
it's a brand new electric
rideable category,
because it combines the standing stance
of a skateboard sideways,
with the scooter's handle,
although not quite,
because it's one handed.
From a beginner, you can
ride with it in one session,
but with an expert,
you can basically do a lot
more riskier moves with it.
-  Dad you hear that?
You can probably do this
and survive to tell the tale.
- Yeah, if I actually had balance.
- 15 miles per hour,
that's almost as fast as I can run Dad.
- Almost.
- The Scooterboard is out.
The Sher brothers are here.
What's up guys.
- What's up?
-  So you just road it, how was it?
- I just rode it, it was awesome.
It rides like a scooter, like a snowboard
and skateboard mixed together.
- Okay, I'm not good at any of those,
but I'm gonna try it.
Okay here I go.
- A little bit more on the pressure.
- A little more?
Come on Jared.
Here we go, here we go.
Whoa whoa.
(laughing)
Here we go.
Okay I think I've got
it, I think I've got it.
Take the camera.
Here we go.
This is so nice.
It feels so good.
I feel like I could go anywhere.
Do you want to try it Dad?
-  I don't think so.
- I haven't found Garrett,
but I think I found myself in a place
where he might be.
And I found some other people around here,
some pretty cool people.
And we're all actually hanging out here,
Garrett's actually gonna go up on stage
and we're gonna listen to him.
So I'm anxious to hear what he has to say.
-  If you were
able to sell your company
for 54 million dollars.
- I am late for this shuttle.
Oh my goodness gracious.
The fire department's here.
Dad you didn't have to
call the fire department,
I was just in the conference, okay?
- That's our airport shuttle.
We're gonna be in a hurry.
- Oh, expedited service.
We are actually running pretty late
for our flight.
Our flight leaves in just a little bit.
But I have to tell a story about that.
So we just finished The
Bucket List family conference
and I got to meet him.
And we've been talking
through Twitter DM's
off and on a little bit
for like a year now,
and it was cool to finally meet him.
And the reason that I'm late
to come out for the shuttle,
is because the conference just went long.
The last couple speakers
went over on their time
and we're cutting it close as it is,
and so I go up to talk
to Garrett afterwards
to say hi to him and like let's plan
one time when we can get together,
your family and our family,
and Derral calls me up on stage.
- No!
- Yeah he calls me up on stage
and he's talking about
this specific strategy
and he's like, Jared has a perfect example
of what not to do.
And I'm like Derral, you're
throwing me under the bus.
And he's like, I tend to do that, don't I?
And I said yes,
so I gave the bad example of what I did
for this YouTube strategy
and then went and talked Garrett,
and I came out here.
There's a fire department,
Dad's waiting for me.
We've missed one shuttle.
We're waiting for a second shuttle.
- We've missed two shuttles.
- Two shuttles, oh jeez, I'm sorry Dad.
Should we call an Uber?
Should we call an Uber?
- No I think we're good.
- We're gonna go home and see our family.
Overall though, how was VidSummit?
- Good.
- I learned a lot.
It was really really great
to have this experience.
This was my first one.
And if you're a creator,
a business or brand,
I think going to VidSummit,
you'll get more information
than any other convention out there.
- Well here I am at the end of the night,
the kids are in bed.
I really hardly filmed today.
We did lots of snuggling,
we played outside the whole
time with our friends.
And something that I want to capture
and show you but I'm gonna tell you.
It's so fun, every day,
every day at like 3:30,
the neighborhood kids
will knock on our door.
I finally put a sign that said knock,
instead of ring the door bell,
because sometimes they wake
Calvin up if he was sleeping.
And they always ask to ride the Segways.
And I am so glad that they think
that it's fun and that
it's okay to come and ask.
They always ask.
They ride the Segways and
at the end of the night,
they put 'em back.
And it's just something fun
that I enjoy having something
that like the neighborhood kids
can come and use and play with
because that's what they're for,
just to have fun with,
and Jared and I don't
use them a whole ton.
So that's fun
and so the kids played with their friends.
But I wanted to show you this.
And we have showed you
guys this 100 times,
so if you're kind of annoyed with it,
definitely skip this part.
But it's something,
it's a work in progress,
especially the office,
because we just have a lot of cords,
a lot of equipment,
and so, we showed you this last time,
like our little system
and the organization
and I like it.
This is what I worked on today.
These are the drones that we have
and then all of these cords
that are in a box.
And then up here, is
just some lingering stuff
up there, I mean it's not
like crazy artsy organized,
but it works, and it's a
lot better than it was.
And then in this cupboard,
we just have tons of batteries
and tons of chargers,
and tons of cameras in there,
and just all that stuff.
All the GoPro stuff's back there.
So it's just like organized
a little bit better.
And the biggest thing
that I did today was,
I got a fireproof, waterproof safe
and I put all of our paperwork in there,
so everything is in there,
and then we obviously
have a ton of house stuff,
like these are our house plans
and a few other house plans that we had
but that we didn't go with,
I have in that box.
So today I did a little bit of organizing
and a lot of playing with the kids.
(dramatic groovy music)
- Rock paper scissors for the window seat.
- Rock paper scissors.
Ready?
- Best out of three?
- Okay.
- Rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors.
Oh!
(dramatic funky music)
You want to meet the pilot again?
- No.
- No, you don't want to
meet the pilot this time?
Okay.
There's about four or five firetrucks
and a couple ambulances
outside the airport.
(flight attendant speaking)
- A show that Jared and I really like,
is This is Us.
And they just came out
with their second season,
so Jared and I have watched
a few episodes of that,
but I feel really like I shouldn't watch
without Jared, so I've been watching a lot
of Parenthood and it kind
of is along the same lines
as This is Us, like the storyline.
And I really like it.
This is another show that
Jared and I would watch,
but we really like This is Us,
so I saved that,
and we'll watch it together.
But I've watched 10
episodes of Parenthood.
When the kids go to bed,
I've stayed up to like one
o'clock watching Parenthood,
because I can't sleep.
So that's what I'm gonna watch
until Jared gets home.
(dramatic groovy music)
- Holy crap, you can
tell we're back in Utah.
It is a blistering 40 degrees outside.
Blistering, that's usually hot, isn't it?
- Yeah, that is.
- It's a frigid 40 degrees outside,
nearly half the temperature in California.
It was 80 degrees, I think, when we left,
40 degrees here in Utah.
Don't worry, the only issue
we're having right now
is Dad can't find the car keys.
We'll see about the car
battery in just a minute.
(laughing)
Did you find the key?
- I found the keys.
-  Okay, let's check the battery.
Come on little car,
little car, little car.
(car dinging)
Yes, we're on our way!
My sweet sweet wife.
- Oh Jared, the second time
we're reunited for you guys.
- Yes, we're staging this.
(kissing)
- How are you?
- Oh I'm so good.
What I said,
I actually did say that,
but what I said is like, it
is so good to see you smile,
I love you so much.
I do, it's true.
- I know.
- I missed you.
- That was kind of awkward
- I was only gone
- for a little bit.
- That was awkward saying
hi the second time.
It was better the first
time, if you were there.
- Yeah, you should've been there.
I've got something fun going on tomorrow.
I'm taking you shopping for
something fun tomorrow okay?
Are you excited?
- You should be excited,
because it's exciting.
It's exciting.
You look like cousin It,
that's what you should be for Halloween.
We will se guys tomorrow.
Thank you so much for watching.
I'm so excited to be home with my family.
- Bla bla bla bla bla bye.
-  Bye.
