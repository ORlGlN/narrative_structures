(jack-in-the-box pops)
- Aay!
- Oh my gosh, is everything on fire,
is everything good?
-  You can't walk anymore?
- No I'm tired.
- You and I personally
haven't really talked
about it that much,
is this right here.
(playful music)
(bell dings)
-  Why are you so cute?
- Because I am.
-  You just are?
- Uh-huh.
(jack-in-the-box pops)
- Aay!
- We are back from church
and it is finally time
for me to try the roast
that Ellie has been raving
about for three days straight.
- I saved a little bit,
so it's the last day.
I hope you like it.
- Well I'm sure I will,
but I don't think you went into detail
about the first roast that you made
that turned out so bad.
- Oh we've talked about that before.
- We've talked about it,
I'll do a quick little summary.
It was one of the first
months that we were married,
maybe even the first week.
- Oh I think it was within the month
we were married.
- Yeah.
We had the Crockpot out,
or not even the Crockpot, it was the--
-  It was in the oven.
- The Corelle oven,
and we had a roast in there
and then we set it for a bunch of time,
just like you normally would,
we went to church
and when we came home, we smelled smoke.
It just smelled so burnt.
Then we went inside
and we were like oh my gosh,
is everything on fire?
Is everything good?
Nothing was on fire.
We looked in the oven,
it was still cooking,
we pulled it out,
sure enough, burnt to a crisp.
Even the carrots were burnt to a crisp.
- Yeah I set it three settings too high.
- Yeah.
So what we had found out
was that Ellie actually turned it
100 degrees higher than
it was supposed to,
but that was a funny
first marriage experience
that we will never ever forget.
And it's important to have those Ellie.
It's important to have moments
where you can look back at yourself
and laugh and compare.
- And that was the first time Jared ever--
I was like aw, eff, son of a.
(Jared laughs)
I was pissed.
- She was so upset.
But now that we have this,
it's just we can look back and laugh on it
and it's a funny experience
and that's how life is.
- Totally.
- It's important to have those moments
where you're having a hard time,
but then you can look
back and laugh on it.
And here we go.
Mmm mmm mmm mmm,
that's a good roast Ellie, good job.
- Was it?
Is it?
- No yeah.
- Or are you just saying that?
- No it's so good,
it's stinkin' good.
- Like the best I've ever made?
- Yeah definitely up there with the best
that you've made.
Probably the best, but
definitely up there.
- Oh my heck,
I think it's the best that I ever made.
And I didn't do anything different,
I just put it in the Crockpot
for four and a half hours.
- Hey wait!
Hey wait!
-  These kids are playin'.
- Coming back to the starting line.
-  Go back to the starting line.
-  Bee!
(Jared laughs)
-  I have no idea
what they're playing,
but they're playing together.
Oh you went past the starting line,
you gotta go back and wait for him.
Calvin you give him the cue when to go.
-  Okay one two three.
-  Bee!
(Jared laughs)
- We are out in the sun.
It feels so good.
(dreamy guitar music)
It's January and it feels so good.
We're taking Penny on a little Sunday walk
in the mountains.
This is our second route,
the first one was a little too cold.
Mister, what's wrong?
- I can't move.
-  You can't walk anymore?
- No I'm tired.
-  Aww dangit.
I think we're almost done, okay?
♪ In circles prance along the ground ♪
We just got done seeing
the cutest little puppy,
our neighbor's little puppy.
And I forgot how, Penny is
still in the puppy stage,
'cause she's a year old,
but that new puppy stage
where they jump on the
kid, knock him over,
kinda maul their face a little.
You know, Penny doesn't
knock the kids over
and then continue to be
around 'em, you know?
It's usually an accident,
by her running too fast or something.
So we left that little
puppy and I was like,
I'm really grateful we're in the stage
of life we're in, just all around.
So cute puppy, but puppies, ah!
What?
- Come.
-  You want me to hold your hand?
- Yeah.
-  I love it
when Penny finds friends
and when the friends are friendly.
That's a big dog.
Look how big that dog is.
Come on Jackson?
You want me to hold your hand?
Wow.
-  How fun is that?
-  I always wanted to ice fish.
-  I know that's like--
-  Some day.
It'll be on our list.
- Bucket list.
- Yeah, I've always wanted to ice fish.
We are listening to the soundtrack
of the Great Showman.
It is amazing.
The kids are asleep,
we're on a Sunday drive.
Just driving around, looking
at the beauty of Utah.

- One thing that we failed to talk about
and you and I personally
haven't really talked
about it that much,
is this right here.
You had an ultrasound while I was gone--
-  I did.
- and we have some pictures
of our baby little boy.
- And he is so cute.
-  Tell me about it,
because you haven't
really told me about it,
going through it.
- Well I did film it on my phone.
It was a really quick one,
like I wasn't scheduled for one,
but my doctor's really good.
And he knows I've been having nerves,
so he did it really quick.
It's hard to see,
because I think he was
flipped a certain way,
because it was hard to see his face.
-  Yeah.
-  But he is a boy.
(Jared laughs)
He is wiggling, I saw his
little hands by his face.
-  Awww.
- The first thing I saw was this
and I was like oh my gosh.
-  How sweet.
- And his profile looks
exactly like the others.
-  Yeah.
-  Look at his profile.
This ultrasound picture
looks so much like the others.
-  It almost looks
like he has a helmet on,
like a football helmet.
- Well look at his nose and his mouth
and how it kinda protrudes out,
like his eyes, it goes in.
and then it sticks out right here.
-  It's just cute.
- That's totally how
Calvin and Jackson looked,
it's gonna be so fun
to see this little guy.
- Yeah, and I love that you can see more
as time goes on, like at
the 20 week ultrasound-
-  Yes.
- And then on after, how fun.
- Hopefully, we'll get better.
- Yeah we totally will.
We haven't had a good 3D ultrasound
with any of our kids.
-  No.
- I think we did it with Calvin
and it didn't work out,
his hands were in front of his face,
so it didn't work out
as the way we wanted.
- Maybe this time we can get one.
- Yeah, I just love that you went in
for an ultrasound and got this.
- So sweet, I'll keep it forever.
-  Little heartbeat, I know.
- I am 16 weeks this week
and it has flown by.
Jared, I asked if he was able to at CES,
to look at some of the
baby electronics stuff.
And he said he wasn't
able to get to that area,
but hopefully, I think
there's something in the works
with me going somewhere
really cool with Jared
and it's kind of like the same thing
as electronics, but it's for babies,
so if that pans out, hopefully I can find
some really fun bassinet,
or just some fun baby stuff
that's new, just electronic stuff.
That would be cool, huh?
- Oh yeah.
- For me.
- And for you, like baby.
- Yeah.
- Well and I really wanted
to try and get over there,
but I found out that it
was in the Sands Expo Hall,
which was not in the same
convention center area.
-  That's a bummer.
- Yeah, so I was really bummed.
- Hopefully this works out.
Did you bring your loot up?
- Uh-huh.
(playful guitar music)
-  Wow, what are
you guys gonna build?
-  A garage.
-  Wow, I heard all the ruckus.
You grabbed everything, piled it up
and brought it up here.
- Wow.
-  Wow.
- Can you make it for me please?
-  I can help you.
- I want this to be the top.
-  Okay, now put the top on top
and we'll finish it off.
Back here.
Perfect.
Some of it will be a covered garage
and then you'll have
space to drive into it.
Like the garage doors.
- Cool.
-  Did I just blow your mind?
(Ellie laughs)
- Mom, here top!
-  You got the top?
- Yeah.
- This is the top.
-  Let him put a few on,
to make him feel like he's helping.
Woo, that's cool.
Okay, put your cars in.
- I want this with the red one.
(beeping)
- Chase?
Where's Chase?
-  Where'd your Chase go?
Say goodnight to Chase.
- Goodnight Chase.
Gone.
-  He's right here in the wagon.
-  Did you put him in there?
- Goodnight cars.
-  See you in the morning.
- Goodnight Chase.
- Calvin, he can go night night in here.
- No, night night is top.
-  He wants to put him in the house
or on top like a guard dog
like (gasps) Rock Dog?
- Yeah.
-  You know how
Rock Dog watches out?
Maybe Chase will watch out.
(high pitched verbalizing)
He's talking so high.
Calvin, what color is this one?
What color is that?
- Red.
-  Red, what color is this?
- Blue.
-  What one's blue?
- This one.
-  What one's green?
- This one.
-  What color is this?
- Blue.
-  Green.
Say goodnight.
- Goodnight.
(crashing)
-  Night.
(Jackson mock crying)
Oh no.
(mock crying)
- My garage is open!
-  It's over.
You broke it.
Here, I have an idea.
Let's see who's fastest at putting them
all in the bucket.
Pick 'em up, pick 'em
up, as fast as you can.
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.
Calvin you're slow, stop break dancing.
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, pick 'em up.
Can you put the cars in?
Go put Chase to bed.
- Well guys that is a wrap on the day.
Thank you so much for watching.
I am so glad to be home with my family.
We had such a great weekend together.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
