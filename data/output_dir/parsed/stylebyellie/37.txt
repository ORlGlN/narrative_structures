- I'm so baby hungry.
He has more shoes than I do.
(mumbling)
- It's just, I just don't enjoy it.
And I don't do it very often.
Good morning, guys.
A couple days ago I said just
because today is terrible
doesn't mean that tomorrow
isn't going to be great.
Well, today is going to be terrible.
It's terrible, Ellie.
We have to go to the dentist
today and get a lot, a lot,
a lot of work done.
- All for eating
crap every night.
- It's true, but-
- Worth it.
- Hashtag worth it.
Hashtag also I'm eating
a salad for lunch today.
So hashtag making improvements.
- Hashtag Jared's gone to
the gym this week with Joel.
- You know that's right.
Good morning, buddies.
What are you guys doing today?
- Drawing.
-  Drawing?
Calvin, are you coloring?
- No.
This one.
-  Oh, you're coloring that one?
Good.
- I'm doing letters.
-  Yeah.
How are you feeling, Jackson?
You feeling a little better?
- No.
- No.
-  No?
Your throat still hurts a little bit?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm sorry bud.
I do think Jackson is on the mend.
He did sleep a lot better last
night than the night before.
So all things considered, even though
we're going to have a
terrible day at the dentist,
Jackson's getting a little bit better.
So that's a thumbs up.
See?
It does get better.
-  Okay, ready to eat Mr. McGoo?
Ready to eat?
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me right now?
Are you kidding me?
It's starting to snow.
Oh my goodness.
Do you see those little flakes?
- I'm not even going to complain.
Do you remember last year when
we couldn't get the fence?
-  That's true.
- I think we annoyed everyone so much.
We couldn't get the fence
'til like, was it April?
It was like snow and frozen.
Just a flurry.
-  Yeah.
What are you guys doing, daydreaming?
- Yeah.
Do you want to see what we're looking at?
-  Yeah.
What were you ladies looking at?
Patio furniture.
- We're looking at patio
furniture and rugs.
Do you like that rug?
-  That's pretty nice.
- Like that rug?
Like that rug?
Dig all of them?
- Yeah, I do.
You can daydream about that all day long.
- And this.
The egg chairs.
-  Ooh, yeah.
That looks good.
You can daydream about that all day long
so long as I can daydream about my Tesla.
Okay?
Ouch.
Ouch.
I'm just gonna back away slowly
and assume that everything's
gonna work out okay.
I may run into another bar
stool, but I'm backing up.
Gosh dang it.
Are you ready for this?
I don't have a fear of the
dentist, I just don't like
getting fillings.
- You have your wallet?
- Yeah, I've got
my wallet.
- You'll pay for me?
- I'll buy your fillings, too.
How many do you have?
- I'm not telling you.
- You have just as many as I do.
I think you do.
It's just, I just don't enjoy it.
And I don't do it very often.
- No one enjoys getting
their mouth prodded.
Let's go.
Do you think they'll let me
sleep when I get it done?
I'll just lay like this.
- This is our Valentine's date by the way.
- Happy Valentine's Day.
We're at the dentist and
you're getting fillings.
That's my gift to you.
- Thank you.
- And we'll come back and do more later.
- Okay.
-  Two hours later.
- Smile.
- Smile.
Gosh dang it, my lips.
This one side-
- I feel like you're overdoing that a lot.
- I am not overdoing it.
Listen, like-
- No, really.
- Listen.
Like I'm doing the best I can.
I'm serious.
- Okay, do this.
Try to rub your lips.
- Did you see that right there?
- You did pretty good.
- So here's the thing.
- Mine are hard to rub.
- Gosh dang it.
Here's the situation.
I'm not joking in the slightest.
I'm trying to talk as best I can.
-  I feel like you're exaggerating.
- I swear.
(laughter)
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
This is joking.
(mumbling)
I'm being as serious as I possibly can.
Like I'm not trying to joke
around with how I'm talking.
The S's are hard.
So I had four cavities.
Okay, I had four cavities
and Ellie did too.
Don't even think you can hide it.
It's the truth.
You did.
But Ellie and I both
opted not to get numbing
on three out of the four cavities.
So I had one here, here,
and I only got numb here.
-  Good job.
- And you did too.
That's what they told me is
you only got one numb shot.
Cause we're tough.
- Okay, guys.
I have a huge baby haul that
I want to share with you guys.
If my smile's crooked
it's cause of the dentist.
But I have a haul and
I just want to show you
some of the items that I've
pulled out for the baby.
This is probably the
biggest haul I'm gonna have.
Maybe I'll have a few more
items that I'll talk about
before baby comes, but like this is like
everything that I've got and
I'm so excited to show you.
If you look over here we
raised the crib the other day
and my mom made this blanket for,
she started with the
oldest and ended with me
and so now this is gonna be
in my little baby boy's crib.
I have his little blanket right here.
And for all of my boys they have had
the infant Minky blankets and then now
they're four and three
and I just got them like
a bigger sized blanket from Minky.
I've bought like four or five
Minky blankets over the years
and this baby is no different.
This is his blanket that I
picked out specifically for him.
And then I got one right
here for the rocking chair.
And I just think the color is beautiful
to go with the chair.
I spend a lot of time here.
A lot of crying from me and the baby,
a lot of sleeping for me and the baby,
and a lot of throw up from the baby
just happens in the rocking chair
and like long nights are spent here.
So I'm excited to have some cozy blankets.
And then I have the cutest clothes.
I cannot wait to put
Jackson and Calvin in these.
I'm really hoping that the boys
will grow a hair so
they'll fit into these.
I got these from Sugar
Babies I found online.
And moms have made these clothes.
Like look how cute and perfect
that is for a newborn body.
Like that is gonna be so sweet
and tender on my little guy.
I wish I had a name for you.
We just call him baby M.
So I have those.
From Sugar Babies also I got this
little outfit and this
little sweat outfit.
It's gonna be pretty warm
when we bring him home.
But when we're in the
house and the AC is going
they like to be cozied up,
so I have this for them.
And then I actually got something
for me and Jackson and Calvin.
I thought these were just
the cutest hats ever.
So I have a momma hat.
Jackson has a little stud hat.
And Calvin has a momma's boy hat.
I think that fits them so perfectly,
so I just got that for us for the summer.
And then my favorite bottles
that I used for Calvin
when I transitioned from breastfeeding
to bottle feeding was
the Comotomo bottles.
And I got these also from
the Sugar Babies site.
And I got two of them.
I plan on nursing, but I also would like
to have these on hand
if I try and not nurse
or when that time comes
when I switch if I do.
With all of my babies I have wanted
like a baby bath of some sort.
We have the coolest, biggest
farm sink in the kitchen
and so I thought this was perfect.
You put this in the sink.
It's a Blooming Baby bath.
And it's just more cozy
for the baby to lay on.
So I thought this would be
really fun for the baby.
I didn't even show you.
What do you think?
-  I like it a lot.
It looks really cool.
- I have a bunch of little baby toys
that I need to get in the room.
The is a teething toy
that I bought for him,
but he's gonna use a lot
of like the other baby toys
that Jackson and Calvin had I
need to bring up in the room.
One of the things that I really
wanted to get for the baby
is a bassinet and I also really
have been wanting one of these.
It's DockATot.
I got this from the Sugar
Babies site as well.
I kind of went ham on there.
And I didn't know quite
what I was expecting.
I didn't realize that
this was gonna be so firm.
This is for ages zero to eight months.
It's a breathable material.
It's like a portable, lightweight.
The baby can do tummy time on here.
He can do play time on here.
I thought this would just be perfect
because when we're together
a lot with the family
we're on my bed, we're on the
couch, we're watching shows.
I just thought that this would be nice
to like have the baby
have his own little space.
So if the baby's on the
floor it's not just like
the baby and then the kids or something.
He at least has something to like kind of
sit in for us to watch him in.
So I am really excited for that.
Are you guys ready to see his closet?
He has more shoes than I do.
Baby M has more shoes than momma does.
This is his closet.
(upbeat music)
I'm just starting to put stuff in here.
This is his closet.
The first thing I have in
here is actually for me.
Mom of boys.
I got this from Etsy.
I just thought that this
would be really cute
and I haven't put it in my room yet.
But with all of my babies I have not
purchased these dividers.
Zero to three months,
three to six, six to nine.
It goes on and up.
I've never purchased these because
I've never felt like I needed them,
but with him he has a ton of
extra clothes from Calvin.
Pretty much Calvin has
worn Jackson's old clothes
so they don't really get hand-me-downs.
This actually was Jackson's.
This was Jackson's.
So there's a couple of Jackson's,
but these mostly are all
Calvin's hand-me-downs.
So I wanted dividers for that reason.
I have a bunch of baby clothes here.
I got these at Old Navy.
So he has some just little onesies.
Just kidding.
They're from The Gap.
I've gotta make sure that's right.
It doesn't matter.
These are from The Gap and then
over here these are from Target.
These are some good night jammies.
For some reason every
baby is so different.
I was really attracted
to blues with Jackson
and this baby it's been
like brown and black
that I've just like, it's felt good.
I got the baby a ton of burp cloths.
These are from Copper and Pearl.
Thank you guys.
You guys gave me the huge recommendation
for Copper and Pearl.
I know Jilly just got a bunch as well.
So these are just awesome burp
rags and the kind of theme
that I'm gonna go for is
like foresty and animals.
He has burp rags.
He has a ton of bib, bandana bibs.
Like how sweet are those?
Like isn't that gonna be cute?
Can you imagine him
wearing that at Christmas?
-  That'll be so sweet.
- So he has those.
With every baby I get
a pack of wash cloths.
These are from Copper and Pearl as well.
Just like when you're bathing them
or if they happen to have
like a really bad rash,
I'll just use them for their bottoms
or giving them a bath so
I have some washcloths.
And this is just a bath towel for him.
So I've already talked about this a ton
but I'm gonna do it
again cause it's my haul.
I got this from Time Maternity.
It's some nipple cream.
I don't know if it's good.
I haven't heard anything review wise,
but this is what I have so we're
gonna try that bad boy out.
I'll let you know if it works.
And then I also got this
from Time Maternity, too.
It's a teething silicone
toy that is a camera.
It's a camera, people.
It fits his alley.
So I can't wait.
Won't that be a cute picture, too?
To take a picture of him doing that.
These never, ever work so
don't even know why I got them.
But I got them from Target.
They're little hand mittens.
They might work for him.
It's kind of like something that I buy
knowing they don't work
hoping that they will.
They usually rip them off and fling
and then they scratch their
faces and it's a hot mess.
So hopefully.
I think maybe a lot of people recommend
putting little sockies on their hands too,
so I might have to do that too.
Over here I have some swaddles.
This is from the Ollie Swaddle.
When I was asking
recommendations of new swaddles,
I was recommended a ton
about Copper and Pearl
and Ollie Swaddles, people love these.
This has come up on my
recommendations on Facebook
a whole ton is the Ollie Swaddle.
People love them.
The material is soft and stretchy
and it comes in like the cutest box ever.
And I'm gonna save cards
and put these in his box.
Every one of my babies has a box of cards.
I'll show you this one.
This box, it was Jackson's that somebody,
a sweet viewer had sent
us a gift for Jackson.
It had a Burt's Bees clothing outfit in it
and I saved the tin and we have
tons of cards in here for Jackson.
That is yours.
He's excited about his.
I decided this box was so sweet,
so I'm gonna save this box
for baby and put all of his cards in.
I also have a nursing cover
slash cover for the car seat.
This is from Copper Pearl.
It is the same matching
print as his towel.
And then I also got some hats and tell me
this is not the cutest color of hat.
And they have little
matching swaddles too,
but I thought these
hats were really sweet.
And this color, like it's so funny.
I would never have picked this color out
for Jackson and Calvin but for some reason
it stood out a lot.
Maybe it's like times have
changed or I don't know what's
popular right now, but I just
saw this and just thought
that looked really sweet, so
he has some hats right there.
And then we are definitely
pulling out our Owlet.
We got this for Calvin
when Calvin was a baby.
I highly recommend it.
I really enjoyed having it with Calvin.
- So basically what you do.
I still have my dentist appointment too.
You put this on their foot
and it reads their heartbeat
and even I think some other levels.
Maybe oxygen.
So it sends all of that
information to your phone
so if anything does happen
you are notified right away,
so it's a good reassurance for parents.
I pulled out the Tula baby
carrier that I had for Calvin.
I love the Tulas.
The Tula and the Ergo
are very popular brands.
I do have both.
I have the Ergo more of like if
we were to go camping or something.
Or like really getting dirty.
It's just like an older one that
I have but it still is good use.
The two I really like, I
love the head strap on it
and I love the way it fits
my body a little better.
Especially it covers the
baby a little bit more.
I feel like there's like an inch longer
than it like cups the
baby's neck a little better.
I feel like the Tula's a little nicer,
but to be honest I feel
like if you were to get one
or the other you'd be
really happy with either or.
So I pulled that out for the baby.
I have a few diapers, a
ton of wipes down here.
And then down in our
basement we have a whole ton
of baby wipes cause you
go through those fast.
But right here is just like
a little section that I have
for now, just of like the baby's needs.
I have butt paste, I have
Orajel when the time comes,
I have gripe water, I have
Tylenol, I have gas relief drops.
I do have a teeny bit
of formula in the back.
Each baby is different.
The Mam brand is what Jackson
totally used for binkies
and I thought these were so cute.
It's a fox and a little raccoon.
And then this is the brand
that Calvin really liked.
The Soothie.
I love binkies.
It soothes the baby.
It helps them.
I do feel like this shaped Calvin's mouth.
He had to suck really hard on
it to keep it in his mouth.
I did find that with
Calvin that I didn't love,
but the dentist said that after two years
once they're off of it their mouths
are so shapeable and
malleable that it's okay.
So I did notice that
with this one, though.
So we'll see which one baby likes.
I remember with Calvin
it was like I had Calvin
and I had everything I needed
but there was one night
where he was fussy and
I wasn't feeling well.
And it's like oh, what do I need to get?
And Jared had to run to the
store and get gripe water.
And so I'm just trying
to remember those things
that would be nice just to have on hand,
rather than wait for the
moment that he needs it.
It's like teething gel.
He's not gonna use
teething gel for months,
but it's just nice to have on hand so that
that one night when he is fussy
that it's like oh his gums
are swollen, oh it's teething.
And I already have it.
So I'm trying to just stock
up on stuff that I know
I'm gonna need even in the
months to come with new baby.
So he also has a ton of shoes.
Look at all of his baby shoes.
These are from all of Calvin
and these are just shoes
that Calvin literally wore
these like for two months.
Those are so dang cute.
I love those.
These church shoes I think
Calvin wore these like once.
He definitely wore these
for a month or two.
It's like come on, Ellie.
I couldn't figure out sizing.
But he just has a ton of church shoes
and a few shoes mixed in there as well.
Okay.
The last thing I'm gonna talk about,
which was very sweet of you.
I didn't even know that
this was what I wanted.
I've been wanting, not like a diaper bag,
but just like a bag, like a book bag.
And Ryla, they actually gave this to me.
They sent it in my P.O. box.
I really appreciate it.
They did not have to do that,
but she gave this to me.
I thought that was so sweet
and I've been looking for
like a little diaper bag anyway.
And I've gone through
a lot of diaper bags.
And not that I've had to, just cause
it's been fun and I wanted to.
My last diaper bag, my
Ju-Ju-Be bag, I really loved.
It was a backpack.
It was like when we were traveling a ton.
And that actually turned into Penny's bag.
We have a ton of toys and
food and stuff for Penny
in that bag and we usually
throw it in our car
for if we're going on a hike
or if we're going somewhere
we can grab stuff out of Penny's bag.
So that kind of turned into her bag.
And I really liked it, but
I don't need a huge bag.
I have learned that when I'm
going out, even when I have
more kids, I actually feel
like I want less space.
I don't know if it's because
I've adapted and known
what I like to use when I go out,
but I think this is gonna fit me perfect.
They have a pocket right here
just for like momma stuff,
keys, phones, and then on the inside
there's two insulated pockets for bottles.
There's a huge area.
Like this would totally be just
diapers and a swaddle blanket.
Like that's pretty much
what the baby needs.
Bottles if I'm using bottles at the time.
And little pockets
right here for my stuff.
And then they have like a
little secret pouch in the back.
So that was really cute
and it was something
that I've been looking for, too.
So I've never heard of them before.
I looked them up.
They're really cute.
It's Ryla is their name, so
I really appreciate that.
That was nice.
What if when the boys come to see the baby
in the hospital they're
wearing their shirts?
Isn't that cute?
And we can dress this on the baby.
-  That would be sweet.
You're so baby hungry right now.
- I'm so baby hungry.
I can't believe I'm at
21 weeks this week, guys.
-  That's insane, Ellie.
- Baby, we can't wait to see you.
And that is my ultimate baby haul.
I have been loving, look Jackson's in it.
You little stinker.
That is what I've been
accumulating for baby.
He definitely doesn't
need any more clothes.
I may grab a few more boxes of diapers.
And then we are still just
debating between the bassinet.
We're going back and forth right now.
I have been loving looking on Instagram
and Pinterest at new baby item websites.
I love the things that I've got.
I'll make sure to post a link for where
I bought these things down
in the description as well.
Thank you guys so much for
helping me out as well.
It's really fun when I sit down on Twitter
and I'm like what is your guy's
favorite swaddle blankets?
What do you guys like for this or that?
It's just been really fun for me as a mom
to kind of communicate with other moms
and other people that
like have information.
Like as far as like even the
bottles, the Comotomo bottles.
When I bought those when
I was trying to figure out
nursing and bottles with Calvin,
I was recommended that
through social media
and it was very helpful for me.
So I do appreciate it.
I hope you guys love this haul.
Can't wait to bring up some of
the baby toys and finish up the room.
New blinds, new curtains are coming in
and a few more bedding items
are coming in for the bed.
So thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Now that my face is like not numb.
Awesome.
Bye.
