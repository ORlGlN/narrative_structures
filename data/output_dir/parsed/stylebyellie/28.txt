- If you're from Louisiana,
my mom speaks the truth.
- This is so fun.
- I just got a message
from one of our IVF couples.
See, it's funny.
(laughing)
Thank you.
Good morning guys.
I found you right where
I left you last night.
I'm up bright and early
at six in the morning,
which I actually get to sleep in today,
because usually I wake
up at five in the morning
to go to the gym,
but I am going to be in Salt
Lake City today all day long
for meetings and I'm very excited.
It's someone that I've never met with
and I'm anxious to see some things
that they have to say.
A little company called
Facebook and Instagram.
Ooh, Facebook owns Instagram,
so it's kinda same same,
but a little bit different.
Anyway, but I have to hit the road
in order to get there on time,
because traffic and snow is
a little cray cray today.
-  He wanted to poke your eye.
Okay run dinosaur run, run!
Go get him.
(Jackson laughing)
- Ball.
- Ooh wait, what about we hugging
and run together.
(Ellie laughs)
(laughing)
-  Who's gonna fall down first?
Oh they both did.
Who won?
- I did.
(Ellie laughs)
- Me.
-  You won?
I think you both won.
(laughing)
(Ellie laughs)
(bright music)
You okay?
(Calvin vocalizing)
What did Mom do?
- Bumped my head.
- Well why were you
standing right by the fridge
when I opened the door?
- I don't know.
- I totally just bonked his head.
Sorry.
This is Jack, Calvin's favorite drink,
which is chocolate milk.
And Jackson, what's your favorite drink?
-  Chocolate milk.
- Yours is chocolate milk?
And Mama's lately has
been strawberry water.
I love Gatorade.
I've been really trying
to just drink water
and I've always had a hard time
drinking just plain water,
but if I have strawberries in it,
I will drink two or three of these a day.
Which is my goal is to drink
at least four a day,
I think that would be perfect,
but if I get two in, I'm happy.
Every morning, I just cut
up fresh strawberries,
I fill it up throughout the day
and then the next morning I do it again.
I cut up a few strawberries
have ice and then that's my whole day.
I've been feeling really good
as far as keeping hydrated.
Calvin, will you grab that sock?
(upbeat guitar music)
- No no no!
- Sorry Calvin, I didn't mean to do that.
(upbeat guitar music)
- Choo choo train.
-  When I see messes
left over from the kids,
I think it is the cutest
thing in the world.
Like what was Calvin thinking
as he was playing with
his horses over here?
I think that mess is so cute.
With Jared and I in the photo
organization life right now,
trying to get all of our photos organized
and into books,
that is one thing I want to do more of
is take a picture of what
the kids have left behind,
whether it's the rock in the dryer
that came from Jackson's pants
or the horses that are on the table
from Calvin playing with.
Just once in a while, when I see something
that's really cute, take a picture of it
and just have it in a little file
in our computer and
eventually print a book
that's called the kids' nicknacks.
These cute moments that the kids
aren't even in, but just something
that they've left behind.
That's just so funny to me.
I don't know, maybe it's
just a parent thing,
you think it's cute if it's your own kid.
But that's just really sweet.
I'm going to be 22 weeks tomorrow
and baby will be the size of a coconut,
is what my app says,
and I can't believe I'm gonna be 22 weeks.
I am moving really slow.
I think I'm definitely moving slower
this pregnancy than I ever have
and I definitely think it's because
I have two other toddlers that I have
and just other stuff that's going on,
but just pregnancy, I'm moving slow.
I can't wait to go to my
chiropractor appointment tomorrow.
My eyes have been hurting for a few days.
And it's like clockwork,
if I don't go every Monday,
if I go any further, I'm miserable.
And I didn't go on Monday,
so I have an appointment tomorrow,
so my head's killing me.
I'm just feeling very pregnant,
but little baby is doing well.
I feel him kicking
and I feel good other
than just the typical
tiredness and headache stuff.
This is so fun.
I have a lady here, she's going out
to get some more prints,
but we are finally getting some shades
on these windows.
Especially this summer,
last summer I was like
how did we go all summer
without shades on there
with the sun blaring through.
But I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna go with clamshell.
But we're gonna do a fun pattern
in my bathroom.
So this is gonna be for the windows
and then I'm gonna do a fun pattern
for my bathroom.
(gentle music)
-  Calvin is asleep.
- I have returned from
my meeting with Facebook.
Is our lens super dirty?
I think it's super dirty.
Don't worry, I'll clean it, just a second.
It was fun.
I had some one on one time with Facebook,
which was very really cool
to talk to them about
some things they have
up and coming.
But that's not the
important thing right now.
I just got a message from one of our
IVF couples Aaron and Rylie.
They had their baby a few months ago
and they said, hey Jared,
we're in your town,
would you like to see the baby?
And we said, yes absolutely,
come over for dinner, because
we just picked up Costa Vida
and they are going to join us.
I am so excited, this is so cool Ellie.
This is so cool.
- What?
That we get Costa Vida for dinner or?
-  Oh yeah yeah, that's cool.
Yeah.
(Jared laughs)
- I'm hungry please.
-  Keep singing it brother.
- No.
-  Caught ya.
- I think the red, there's the baby.
- Is that the baby?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Do you like him?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you gonna be nice when we have baby?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna want to hold him?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay, sounds awesome.
(laughs)
- Guys, Aaron and Rylie are here, yay.
- Hey.
- Yay.
-  And they
brought their baby Declan.
- And Calvin is being really good.
-  Yes he is.
Hi bud, can you give us a smile?
Look at him look right into the camera.
- Well thanks for coming over,
because it is February
and we washed our hands.
- I know.
- Yeah.
- Right.
- It's kinda scary bringing a baby out.
- Well he already had RSV, so.
- Aww, how's he doing?
- That's awful.
- He's doing good.
- Is that scary?
- Good.
- We actually have just gotten over it.
- I didn't know that.
- It was so scary.
- Like last week.
-  I didn't know that.
- Yeah, we were worried about him having
to go to the hospital.
Or dying or, yeah.
-  Babies, yeah they die with that.
- After the baby gets here
and then it's three months later.
- It's okay.
- We all get busy.
- It's okay.
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, it's life.
I do not blame you and
it's winter, so it's okay.
- Oh look at the smile.
- He is so handsome.
-  Oh thanks.
- I can't believe this.
-  He looks a lot
like her side of the family.
- My side of the family.
- Really?
-  Well I was gonna
say, I see some blond,
but there's some red in there too.
- Yeah that's what people tell me.
- The fair skin,
the really pretty fair skin.
- Yeah yeah.
- He's so cute.
-  Oh my gosh.
- I just can't believe how stout he is.
- Yeah.
- But maybe it's because
Calvin was this little--
- Calvin was tiny and Jackson was a chunk.
Like looking back at our photos,
that was like Jackson.
- Yeah.
-  He's got the
chubby cheeks and everything.
- It's kinda nice to hold a hearty baby.
- Yes yes.
(Jared laughs)
- I think he weighs as much as Calvin.
(laughing)
- You know it's been a really long day
when Dad is falling asleep at the table.
(Jared laughing)
- I'm not.
- Mom?
Yeah, he totally is.
Dad and I actually both droved out.
I went to Salt Lake,
Dad went even further
down into Utah county
is what we're calling it
and he had a meeting
with his brother today,
which was pretty cool.
And you know, driving in Utah,
with the worst drivers in
the world, it's tiring.
Wouldn't you say Dad?
- It is, absolutely.
- So Ellie, I'm sorry to
throw you under the bus.
- Oh it's okay.
(laughing)
Get it, because we're
talking about driving?
It's funny.
(laughing)
Thank you, thank you I needed that.
It's tiring driving with
some of the worst drivers.
Honestly, I think in a national ranking,
like a poll,
Utah was number four
worst states to drive in.
- Well they're mean.
The other day, someone flipped Jared off
out of the middle of
nowhere, and we're like,
we're going 15 over, and
he still was ticked at you.
It was really bad.
- Louisiana has worst drivers than Utah.
- Yep yep.
- I'll say that.
Oh my goodness.
- Look if you're from Louisiana,
my mom speaks the truth, okay?
(laughing)
I'm sorry if you're from Louisiana
and you're a good driver,
you're not included in that.
-  Did she snort
a bone or something?
She sounds nasally.
What, you are sick of me?
Were you sick of me today?
- I missed my doggie today.
-  She missed you.
- Yeah.
- Aww see, she does like me.
Seeing Aaron and Rylie was so fun
and seeing their baby.
And seeing Jackson and Calvin
with the baby was so cute.
Calvin went and got his binky
and gave it to the baby
and was so sweet and soft.
It makes me excited to see what he's like
with our little guy coming.
And then when they left actually
at the dinner table, it
kinda shocked us all,
Jackson goes, is our baby gonna live?
And I said yes, our baby's gonna live.
It struck a chord, it was just like ahh.
Just hearing a toddler say that,
it's like he knows that I
did have the baby in my tummy
and the baby didn't live.
And it was just really weird.
Would you say weird?
Another word, sad, I don't know.
- It kinda takes you out of your body,
just making you think about everything.
Because we were open
about it with Jackson.
He knows what's going on and--
- But it was a good conversation to have.
It was sweet of him.
I don't know really what to say
other than that's what
happened, just yeah.
Broke this bad guy out last night,
it was the best sleep
I've had in a long time.
Pregnancy pillow, for the win.
Maybe that's why babies
like those bassinets
or what are they called?
Rock and plays or the
DockATots or something,
Docadots or something like that,
where it cocoons then,
because I had the best sleep ever
sleeping with my pregnancy pillow.
I should've busted it out weeks ago.
This little guy today is so sore
and so tired.
Oh my gosh, my stomach
has not been this tight.
- Well when Aaron and Rylie were here,
you were like oh, I
pushed my tummy too hard.
- Yeah I was pushing my stomach
and it hurt so bad and I didn't mean to.
- That's okay, our little guys growing.
- It was crazy, but my stomach
feels super tight right now.
We'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Thanks for watching, bye.
