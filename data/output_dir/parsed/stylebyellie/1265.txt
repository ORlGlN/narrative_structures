really focusing on ass all the
I think I heard the question right
online while you are wanting to interact
and share our story one of the main
reasons why I want to share our story
was because we were going for something
that not many people and my family could
relate to and so I was trying to figure
out how I can relate to somebody and so
we started sharing our videos online and
in that way we were reading into
thousands and people and I could hear
doubt people's stories on them trying to
conceive and trying to have a baby
and that was actually made my family
realize like why we were why we were
doing this and they realized how cool
the community it is to interact with
people
oh boy
you guys are the best everybody want to
go to you I Drive you could wrong or
