- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Are you okay to do this video with me?
Okay.
So it has been a year
since I have saved
little notes in my phone
of what you had said.
- Ugly?
- Jackson had said some really sweet
funny, tender things over this last year.
And several of those
things I've tweeted out,
but most of them I've
just saved in my phone.
Come here, hon.
You just up and left our video.
(laughs)
Our friends wondered where you went.
So I have saved these cute little moments
and I don't know how I want to do it.
I'll kind of tell you the situation
and then I'll retell Jacks what he said,
for him to repeat to tell you guys,
because he obviously doesn't remember
all the things he said.
The first thing he said
- Butt crack.
- Butt crack?
(laughs)
- The things almost four year olds say.
So one time, there was
a noise in the bathroom
and you ran to the bathroom and you said,
- Is that my baby Calvin?
- He did say it.
He said is that my baby Calvin?
And I thought it was so cute,
when we first moved into the house,
Calvin was still little,
he would cry quite a bit
and Jackson would always
say, is that my baby?
It was so tender and cute.
One time Penny was outside barking
at like a neighbor cat,
and Jackson came running
to the door saying,
- I'm coming Pen, it's okay, I'm here.
- Yeah, he said Pen I'm coming, I'm here.
And you were gonna be there for Pen, huh?
- Yeah.
Oh yeah, web psssht!
Probably I love you.
- He says that a lot,
probably I love you Mom.
This is one time Jackson was leaving
to get in the car to go
over to Uncle Joel's house
and Jackson, you said,
- Penny, I'm going to Uncle Joel's house.
Be happy?
- He said, Penny I'm going
to Uncle Joel's house.
You happy?
You were sad to leave Penny.
- Yeah.
- Are you sad sometimes
if we have to leave Penny?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
This was when we very first got Penny.
She was laying down and
Jackson was just observing her
and kinda poking her,
and kind of petting her
and you looked at her and you said,
- Oh Penny, you have an
awful lot of eyebrows dude.
(laughing)
Who would want two ears?
- Jackson expresses his love quite a bit.
And one time Jackson, you said,
- I love Daddy, probably Penny and Calvin.
- Yeah you were telling me
how much you loved Daddy.
And mmm, you don't want to
forget about Penny and Calvin.
Oh this was hilarious.
This was hilarious.
I love that I wrote this down,
because I almost forgot this.
We had just gotten done
hanging out with Aspen
and Jackson asked, who's my husband,
Aunt Bonnie or Aspen?
And I died laughing.
- Who's my husband, Bonnie or Aspen?
(laughs)
- I kind of want him
to repeat what he said
so you can hear it from
a four year old's mouth.
One time we left Aunt Bonnie's house
and it was a little stressful,
the kids weren't listening very well
and I was trying to
talk to Jackson about it
and I said Jackson, what did you do
to Aunt Bonnie's basement?
And he looked at me and said,
- I made a mess in Bonnie's basement.
- So sometimes
- Butt crack.
- when I go to the store,
the kids are really good
and sometimes when I go to the store,
the kids are not very happy.
So I went to Kohl's one time
and I was walking around
and in the middle of walking around,
Jackson yells, as loud as he can,
- I don't want want to look at Mom things!
- He said, I don't want
to look at Mom things!
And everyone looked at me
and we all laughed,
because it was coming
from a three year old
and it was hilarious.
So sometimes I ask Jackson,
what's your favorite thing about Dad,
what's your favorite thing about Grandma
and I ask him what he thinks
about other people.
And one time I said Jackson,
what's your favorite thing about Dad?
And your response was,
- His chin!
- His chin.
You like Dad's chin?
That was kinda funny.
Jackson was in gymnastic class for a year
and he ran up to his teacher
yelling one time, and he said,
- Teacher my hero is Spiderman.
- Your hero is Spiderman.
Is he still your hero?
- Yeah, he's my favorite guy ever.
I need to go get my mask
and come right down to film.
- Let's get your mask when we're all done
and we'll say goodbye with your mask.
One time I was getting ready
and this is probably something
- Mommy, give me your hand.
- This is a story I'll just tell you guys.
One time, this is the
sweetest innocence of kids,
I was getting dressed
and Jackson walked in and he goes,
Mom, is that a freckle?
And I said, nope, that's not a freckle,
that is a nipple.
And that is when we talked about
a few private parts.
And that is when Jackson learned
about what nipples were.
One time I was expressing to Jackson
how much I loved him
and I said, Jackson what
would I do without you?
And his response was,
- Vacuum.
- You think I would vacuum without you?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you see me vacuum a lot.
- Uh-huh.
- So do you remember when
we used to have no grass?
- Yeah.
- Well, when the snow melted,
I said, Jackson it's summer.
And he said,
- We get grass and a trailer.
- He had overheard Jared and I talking
so much about getting grass and a trailer
during the summer
that he was so excited to
get grass and a trailer.
And I thought that was so cute
that he'd yelled that.
That he was so excited.
(whining)
- I'm trying to button it up goof ball.
Can you feel it on your back?
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to button it up.
Say thank you Mom.
- Thank you Mom.
- You're welcome.
So this summer there was a lot of fires
in Utah, and especially in Montana,
California, and the
one I was talking about
was in Montana.
I was talking to Jared about the fire
and how tragic it was
and Jackson was very adamant, he said,
- We have to blow water and go there.
- He said Mom we have
to blow out with water
and go there now.
He overheard me talking about the fires
and he was like, let's
just blow it out with water
and let's go there.
And you were just ready
to help people, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So when I was expecting a baby
before I had a miscarriage,
Jackson asked me, he said,
- Is my baby gonna turn into Boss Baby?
- He said is my baby
gonna turn into Boss Baby?
Because you had loved watching Boss Baby
and you were a little worried
that the baby would
come out like Boss Baby.
So Jackson's favorite
game is a motorcycle game.
He asks to play it quite a bit,
but we're almost done.
Let's answer two more questions okay?
- Okay.
I'm ready.
- Okay, Jackson said and
this was just recently,
he actually told Jared this.
I've been writing down
everything that I've heard.
I haven't written down anything
that like he said to Jared.
So what did he say today?
- Remember at our old house
Dad flushed Mom in the
toilet, down the toilet?
- Did you think that Dad
flushed me down the toilet?
- Yeah.
- When did he do that?
- I don't know.
- Well I don't know either.
I was shocked when you said it.
He told Jared today, he was
like, remember at our old house
when you flushed Mom down the toilet?
I was just like what?
And last but not least,
this is a little clip I saved on my phone
to send to my family
and Jackson was very
concerned about his bike
and it may include a swear word.
- Where is my
- What did you say?
- Where's my damn bike?
-  I didn't hear you what?
- Where's my damn bike.
- Oh.
And that is the video from Jackson and I
to you guys.
Those are some funny, cute,
bad things that he has said
over the last year
that I thought were worth noting
and writing down.
I've been wanting to do
this video for awhile
and now is the perfect timing,
while Jared and I headed
out of the country.
So I hope that you got a little giggle
out of that, I will
cherish this little video,
because I'll look back
and think of the things that he said.
And I'm gonna continue
to write things down
that Jackson has said.
If your kids have said
anything that is funny,
definitely write it in the comments below.
It is always funny what kids say.
And it's a learning time,
I mean especially when
I was in the bathroom,
I was like, okay, I'm not just gonna say,
no it's not a freckle
and not say anything,
I just thought well this
is a good opportunity.
I'll just tell him what it is,
and it hasn't been a big deal since.
Kids are cute and kids are funny.
Kids are innocent, and I love them
and I love you.
- Ahhhh.
- So thanks for doing this
video with me Jackson.
- (muffled) Okay.
- Okay, should we say goodbye?
- I need my mask first.
- Oh, where's your mask?
- Upstairs in your bedroom.
- Oh Daddy will go get it.
We could not find Jackson's
Spiderman mask anywhere,
so we're just gonna have to end it
with your Spiderman costume, huh?
- Yes.
- We'll go find it, I looked everywhere.
Okay, thank you guys so much
for watching this video.
And we will see you in our next.
- Okay bye.
Pssht!
(laughs)
