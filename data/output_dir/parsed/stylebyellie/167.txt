(happy upbeat music)
- Alright, the kids are not feeling
all that well.
They're getting over a
little cough that they have
and so Jackson is having
a sick day from school.
So I thought it would be fun
to do something extra
special for breakfast.
So I'm gonna make breakfast.
Just watch, you'll see.
(upbeat happy music)
I have breakfast for each of you.
Here you go, Cal.
- Are we gonna eat them in our tummy?
-  Yup.
- Oh, they're not real!
-  But this is for you.
I made it.
- This is not real.
-  Well, at least drink the milk.
- It's not real!
-  There's no milk in there?
I poured the milk!
Here Calvin.
Will you eat?
-  This is not real.
-  Oh, do you need real food?
You don't wanna eat what I made you?
- No, this is not real.
- Okay.
Well, let me tell you something.
I have something very special
for you for breakfast.
So, if you don't like this,
maybe you'll like what
else I have planned okay?
(happy upbeat music)
- This is my dad's first flight.
He wants to get a picture with the pilot.
Is that possible?
Do you wanna get a picture with the pilot?
(laughter)
He's so embarrassed.
I'm sorry.
- We don't need to do that.
-  Yeah, go ahead.
- Go ahead, Dad!
Good how are you guys?
-  Good!
-  Hi!
- Hi, how are you?
- You one of our Delta pilots here?
- No, he wants to meet you guys.
(laughter)
- Okay, Jackson, Calvin it's ready!
I'm down here, okay?
I made the kids a better breakfast
that I think they'll like.
The first one obviously was a flop.
I knew they probably would be like,
"What? This is weird?"
I thought it was funny.
But I made them breakfast in here.
And we'll see what they think.
So they can eat breakfast
in their own kitchen.
Come here!
Where's Calvin?
- Is it real?
Or the toy one?
-  Is it the toy one?
I don't know.
Let's wait for Calvin, okay?
- What?
I want syrup.
-  Do you like it?
Is this okay to eat in your
own kitchen this morning?
- Yeah, I wanted syrup.
-  Okay.
What did I make you?
- Pancakes!
-  What kind?
- Mickey Mouse.
-  Did you have those on the ship?
-  Yeah.
- These are cough drop suckers,
I guess for kids.
And as you can hear,
mama needs some too.
Do you want me to cut it for ya?
-  No.
- No?
- I want to.
- Okay.
(happy light music)
- Well, we made it to Los Angeles.
And Dad said, "I'll try
not to embarrass you."
I said, "Okay good.
Because my goal is to
embarrass you as much as I can"
- And you did!
- And would you say I've succeeded?
- I'd say you have succeeded.
- Okay, good.
Mission accomplished.
Hey Jarvey.
- Hey!
(laughs)
- Come here, Calvin.
Do you wanna play with it?
So this one's Calvin's
because there's only four.
But this one has more pieces.
That one's yours.
Do you wanna take it out?
And build it?
Good job.
Hey Jer.
Good, how are you?
While Dad I gone doing a little
bit of business right now,
we are kind of having a low key day
where I broke out some puzzles.
Jackson really like puzzles.
And you do.
He usually plays with an
airplane one at preschool
but I broke the puzzles out.
And I thought Calvin would like this one
a little but more than,
more than he's doing.
But he's watching.
(laughs)
What do you think, Mr. Cal?
- It goes right here.
-  Yeah, good job.
- I did it!
- This morning has been just,
one of those mornings.
And when you say, "just
one of those mornings"
most people know that it's just been
one of those mornings
where it usually is just like so-so.
Not that well.
Kind of along that route.
The kids have just been really whiny.
Just because they're just
getting over their coughs.
They're really tired
and I've been in the kitchen cooking.
Jackson was kinda whiny and
he was kinda done with puzzles
and wanting to watch a show
but we've watched lots
of shows this morning
and I was like, I'm not
letting you watch TV
you're just gonna have
to just not watch shows.
We're done.
And he's like, "let me
just lay on your bed!"
And I'm like, okay
and I went and looked on him
and he put himself to bed.
So cute.
And I feel bad that he was so,
we're not gonna go in there.
I just felt kinda bad.
They're just kind of,
you know that stage where
you're getting over a cold
and you're just kinda grumpy
and your nose has been
stuffy for a few days
and you're just done with it?
I think that's where the kids are at.
- Oh look!
You dropped your name tag, Dad.
We'll just put that chip
right on your shoulder.
(laughter)
We are at VidSummit today.
My dad and I flew out
today to go to VidSummit.
VidSummit, if you didn't know,
is all about creators learning
more about what they do.
Specifically, the business
side of everything.
Oh that light is so bright and blue.
So I'm excited.
I think it's very important to
learn more about
anything you can.
And especially when it's in your field.
So the next couple days
is going to be filled
with some people who are
very inspiring and motivated.
And just even tonight,
we've had so much fun.
Learning and talking with people.
And one of the best parts
about all of this is
seeing your buddies.
- (in unison) Hey!
- I just got into our hotel room
but I don't think my
dad knows I'm here yet.
Boo.
(laughter)
How did you not hear me?
- I got--
(laughs)
I came into the room
and I was like, "howdy!"
And I was sitting here and I vlogged
and I was like, I just
walked into the hotel room
but I don't think my
dad knows I'm here yet.
(laughter)
Did I scare you?
- No, not at all!
- Oh please!
- No, no, no!
- You jumped.
You went pale.
- Nope.
(laughter)
- We are all up from naps.
And I feel like sometimes
I need to give my kids
a little better
like, understanding
cause sometimes when I
don't get enough sleep
I get cranky, you know?
And I think that that's part of it.
But we're all up from naps.
We gonna put your shoe on?
Jackson, did you have a good rest?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah?
Did you dream about anything.
-  I didn't.
- You didn't?
Okay, let's go play with Penny, okay?
You guys wanna give her a carrot?
I made a chicken pot pie for lunch.
And dinner ha!
Because that's what we're
gonna eat for like two days.
And I have left over carrots.
Here, Cal, do you wanna
give Penny a carrot?
You gotta give it to
her or she'll take it.
Here you go, Pen.
Soft.
Good girl!
(laughs)
You want another one?
Let's see if Calvin will
let you give it her.
He doesn't seem...
- Penny!
Come here, girl.
- Come hold this for me.
(happy acoustic music)
I'm trying to show Jackson
and he doesn't see very excited about this
but I think he'll like it once I show him.
You take the leaf,
you put it under the paper,
and you put the paper on top.
And look.
He has a bug in his hand.
You take the crayon,
and you color over the leaf.
These are kinda like your stencils.
- Can I do it?
- Isn't that cool?
Can you see that leaf?
Right there?
(Calvin crying)
You wanna try one?
- No.
- Do you wanna try it?
- No.
- No?
Ugh, well today's kind of a bust.
You just wanna play
with bugs and eat them?
- No!
(laughs)
- That was fun for me.
Come here!
Come tell me.
Jackson's finding bugs in his jar.
And he's like Mom, I found this bug.
(gasps) Penny!
Mom, Penny ate my bug!
(laughter)
What happened?
- Penny ate my bug.
- Penny Girl.
Aw, I'm sorry.
Why does that make me laugh so hard?
(laughter)
Oh.
- Everyone, desserts
assemble!
- Ah!
- Whoa, Choco Tacos!
- Yes we did.
We hit up the gift shop
and we got desserts.
Choco Tacos remind me of my childhood.
Have you ever had one before?
- Yes!
- They're like the freaking best.
It's just like this perfect mixture of
cholcolatey goodness and vanilla ice cream
and waffle something or another.
- This is what we do when
we don't have our kids.
- Yeah!
- We hang out and eat ice cream
- In a hotel!
- In hotel rooms.
- Whoa!
That was quite a jump.
Okay, let's go to bed.
We can not find Jackson's bike today.
Huh?
Where was your bike?
- Somewhere.
- Somewhere.
We don't know where his bike is.
And the Batmobile.
We've had the Batmobile for like,
a year and
where you take it out to charge it
was jammed.
Like it got backed up into something.
And I cannot get it open
to charge the battery.
That is the best toy we have.
Like, the Batmobile.
We might have to get another one sometime.
- Yeah.
- Cause that's really fun.
Yeah.
- And I get a Batman-ville.
- A Batman-ville?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Maybe we'll get a different one this time.
Maybe we'll get like a truck.
- I think it's one of those.
- Yeah.
- For Christmas.
- Yeah.
Okay, put your arm together.
Say goodnight to our friends.
- Goodnight.
- Say goodnight, daddy.
- Goodnight, daddy.
- So, Carl made the obvious observation
that Brian and are matching shirts.
- We are wearing the same shirt, huh?
- So we were laying on the bed.
I think you posted it on
Twitter or something like that,
Carl posted on Twitter like,
Oh sleepover!
We're all in the bed.
It was funny so.
It's like almost midnight.
We've got an early morning tomorrow so
I'm gonna call it a night so
goodnight to you.
- Night, man!
- Goodnight to you.
- Good seeing you, buddy.
- And goodnight to you.
