- What's up guys?
I am driving to the airport right now
because I am heading over to CES,
the Consumer Electronics Show of 2018
and it is pouring down rain today.
Why isn't it snow?
I don't know, but it's making the drive
a lot easier than driving through snow.
(upbeat music)
- I feel like a traitor this morning.
I'm not eating boiled eggs,
I'm eating scrambled eggs.
I'm not using my Instant Pot,
I'm using my Crockpot.
Ah!
(laughs)
I'm making a roast today
and I actually didn't want it to be done
right way, I just wanted
to throw it in the pot
and let it sit, rather
than use the Instant Pot.
So that's the Crockpot.
Mister Magoo is following me around.
- Hi.
-  You want more eggs?
- Yeah.
-  What do you want more of?
- More eggs.
-  More eggs.
Arrr.
You're my Hulk baby.
Why do you always come up
to me and Hulk-smash me?
(Ellie laughs)
Huh?
And dance, you're a good dancer.
And go to sleep, goodnight (snores).
And clean my floor.
- So CES is basically the
world's largest tech convention.
Actually maybe it's the second largest.
Maybe the one in China is the largest.
Anyway, basically it's my place
that I've always wanted
to go to, even as a kid.
And I went last year
and this time I'm going again,
but not just as an attendee,
as a speaker and I'm
so excited about that,
because basically what this is,
is Jared, you're a kid in a candy store
and you're gonna have tons of fun.
I'm meeting up with a couple
of my very good buddies
and we've got some fun stuff
that we've got planned
for the next couple of days.
I'm an idiot, I forgot
my wallet in the car.
That could've been really really bad.
Don't forget your wallet, Jared.
I know you do that a lot,
but just a reminder to yourself again,
don't forget your wallet.
(atmospheric music)
(beeping)
-  Hi.
Thank you.
-  Thank you.
- Hi, welcome aboard.
-  Hi, thank you.
-  Can I see your ID please?
-  Yes.
-  I have your name here,
but it's not until tomorrow.
- So I don't know if you
heard the conversation,
but apparently the company that invited me
to Las Vegas only booked me for one night
and it's tomorrow, not today.
So, a little bit of an issue
that we ran into tonight,
and we've got some work to do.
But for now, I've got to charge my phone
because it's dead,
and you can't communicate or book a hotel,
at a booked hotel, without a phone so.
- It looks good, that looks good.
- Okay.
- Do you think?
- Well I think so.
- So before you get like--
yeah, don't let it drip onto the bowl.
-  I'll try not.
I'm just trying to get some good stuff.
-  Potatoes, yes.
-  Okay, here we go, one two three.
Woo.
You want a pretty one on top?
- Yeah let's pick a good
broccoli to go right here.
- Mom used to make homemade bread bowls
and it has been years.
I forgot about 'em.
They're beautiful.
So Mom and Bonnie right now,
they're doing a little photo shoot
and here next week Mom's
gonna come to my house,
and we're gonna do a pie photo shoot.
And then we're gonna wrap up.
We pretty much have all the recipes.
Have you gone to Ruby's yet?
- We're going--
- Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
-  Next month.
- Yeah next month we're all going
to Ruby's for a photo shoot.
They went to Beau's,
so fun we are wrapping up
on this family cookbook.
And it's been so fun to just hang out
and watch you mostly cook.
(laughs)
- I have to say I was
super nervous for a second.
I didn't think I was going to have a room.
Luckily the company that I am speaking for
saved the day, they really did.
So I'm here at CES
and I'm going to be speaking
for one of my favorite companies.
And this is so cool to me,
because all my life I've
wanted to go to CES.
Last year I came to CES as an attendee,
this year I'm speaking at CES
for one of my favorite companies
and that's DJI, the company that makes
these incredible drones.
They have asked me to
speak about their products
to all of these people at CES.
And I'm so honored and privileged
to be able to do something like this
and it's just childhood dream come true.
Like if I told Little
Jared that I'm doing this
tomorrow, he would freak out,
and he wouldn't believe it.
Anyway, they saved the day.
I have a room now (laughs).
I can go to sleep.
But I'm not going to sleep yet.
I'm not going to sleep,
because I'm meeting up
with my good buddies,
Zack and Dan.
And we're going to do something
absolutely crazy tonight.
- I've spent most of my morning
with my mom and Bonnie
working on the cookbook
and the cookbook, it's not
just gonna be a cookbook,
it is a story.
There is emotion in there,
there's humor in there
and I kept telling my mom, I'm like,
even if it's just for the family,
this is so worth it,
because so many times I have called my mom
over the years and I say
how do you make this.
Bonnie makes awesome Sloppy Joe's,
she's given me the recipe,
I don't know where it is.
So to have a book of all
of our family's recipes is amazing.
If you guys don't have your grandma's,
your mom's, your neighbor's
chocolates that are so awesome,
some sort of recipes that
you love written down,
seriously write it down.
My mom, she's like if my mom was alive,
if she could have even more recipes,
she would love that.
So sometimes it just gets lost
down from generation to generation
and I just really like that
we're gonna have a spot,
one spot with all the recipes.
So it's been fun, I can't
wait for the next month,
we have a bunch of photo shoots
that we're gonna finish up
and then we'll be done
and then we're gonna get into the whole
making of the book, so I can't wait.
I'm gonna have to say that Jackson's
most used toy that he's
ever ever ever received
already in a matter of just 24 hours,
this toy he has played
with for hours and hours.
He went to bed late, he woke up early,
played with it, he's been so entertained.
He loves loop de loops,
place to store all the cars.
This is so fun, even Calvin
loves playing on it, huh?
Woo, that one flew off.
- This one can fly.
-  What's your
favorite part of your toy?
Because there's so many parts to it.
Do you like the loop de loops?
Do you like the storage?
Do you like where it pulls the cars up?
- I love the rocketship.
- The rocketship, that's pretty cool.
I never thought I would say this,
because the most toys we have are cars,
like we have plenty of cars,
and all the cars in there.
So I never thought I'd say I think
I want more Hot Wheel cars.
But I think next time we
go to the grocery store,
I want to get some more.
Because I think it would be really fun
to fill this bad boy up.
How fun.
I just love this and I love that I can see
my old toys in here, my old
Hot Wheel cars that I had.
- You know what Dan?
It's always good to see a
familiar face in Las Vegas.
- That's right, on the Strip at 3:00 AM.
- At three in the morning.
- That's what we do,
- two Utah boys.
- Yeah, we're actually right in front
of Planet Hollywood
right now with Mercedes.
We just came up in one of
these Mercedes shuttles.
And we're on the Strip.
And they have closed it down, like I said.
They shut down the Strip.
There are police officers over there.
- This is legit, Jared.
Just for us.
- Yeah, yeah.
- After we're done, they're
gonna open it back up again.
That may not be fully true, but--
- It's partially true.
There's some truth to these statements.
They've invited us to
come test drive this,
well not even test drive,
test ride this new autonomous vehicle
called the Mercedes Smart
Vision EQ fortwo smart car.
- So the question is,
I officially invited
Jared to come to this,
- Yeah.
- But will Jared choose
me or Zack to be his
second person in the
car, that's the question
or will you just ride alone.
- Or will--
- It's for two, though.
- Or will I sit on Zack's lap
and we all ride at the same time.
That's the big question.
- I don't think Zack's
gonna go for that one.
- So you can tell from
the name of the car,
EQ fortwo, that actually
means it's a two-seater car,
but it's completely autonomous.
I just looked at it, there's
not a steering wheel.
- No, nothing.
- Let's see if we can
get just a little closer
and see on the inside of it.
Look how tiny it is in the first place.
But there's no steering wheel.
It just drives itself.
I was talking to the guys
at Mercedes over here
and they said this is
the first concept car
from Mercedes in 135 years.
There's no steering wheel,
there are no pedals whatsoever.
That's kinda crazy to me,
because that's just so foreign.
Like I said on the videos,
watching those videos on the screen,
they're promoting something
that we're actively prohibiting
against right now.
And it's just cool to see the future
and being a part of it right now,
such huge dramatic changes in the future
and I'm glad I can be a part of it.
So we're gonna go inside
of that pretty soon
and go for a ride.
This'll be my first time
in a completely autonomous vehicle.
I've ridden in a Tesla before,
but that isn't autonomous just yet,
due to government
regulations and everything.
Oh my gosh, it's going right now.
Look at it go.
(bright electronic music)
- Can I race with you?
- Yep.
-  Let's put a
car up here together.
Go one two three, let go.
Whoa, you won.
- I won.
-  Do you want to race me Cal?
- Yeah.
-  Okay come over here.
One two three go.
Oh no, I'm so far behind.
- Whoa.
Yeah.
- Mine won.
(clicking)
-  We are testing the cars to see
which ones fit on this
and we just opened up parking garage four
so that they will fall
into parking garage four,
instead of the top one.
These all are working,
so Jackson's taking them and parking them.
- Put it in there.
- Now it is the time.
It is our time slot to get in this guy
and go for a ride.
So here is just a quick look at the inside
of the vehicle.
It's very simple with the
seating and everything,
but there's just one
giant display right here.
And apparently, if this is your car,
it'll have your name and
have your information,
everything that you need right up here.
Looks like speakers on both sides.
Just a cool little car for two.
Uh-oh, the police are on the bus.
(Jared laughs)
They're getting after that bus,
that bus was not supposed
to cross that line.
Uh-oh.
Sorry, sorry.
That bus was not supposed
to be doing that.
They crossed that line.
Yeah, that's why we have
the police here guys.
Follow the rules, follow the cones.
I think one of the coolest
parts about being here
at CES is that each one of us,
Zack and Dan are here
for different things.
Zack has been working with
Huawei, cell phone company,
Dan is doing some stuff for Mercedes
and I'm here with DJI,
like we're all doing different things,
but we're here together.
- We're here together, not sleeping.
- Yes it is--
- At three o'clock in
the morning on the Strip.
- It is 3:45 in the morning.
The Strip is shut down
and we're riding in an
autonomous smart car.
This is pretty cool man.
- It's great.
- This is awesome.
- No complaints,
- no complaints.
- Yeah.
- Shake Shack afterwards?
- Yeah, I'm in.
- It's my turn, let's go.
Oh my gosh.
(laughs)
These seats are comfier than I thought.
I thought they were all hard plastic,
but they're memory foam, that's crazy.
I guess one of the weirdest
parts about this car right now,
is they have a video playing,
almost like a YouTube video,
where it had like 5,000
views or something like that.
And that's just so foreign
to us on the road right now,
like don't be on your cell phone,
don't be watching videos
while you're driving.
But this is promoting that.
Like right here, look.
They're having a video, it has views
and that's just so different
than what we're accustomed to.
It's promoting the recreation
that we may want to do,
but we're not supposed to do.
- So I'm bringing my other buddy.
- Hey.
- Hey Jared.
- How's it going?
- What's up Jared?
- I kept the seat warm for
you, I hope that's alright.
- Thank you.
- Oh the door's closing, look at that.
I feel like they should have the sound
like a like schwoooo, like a--
- Listen, there's a sound.
Like a spaceship.
- Yeah.
- Like we're in a spaceship
and the thing just closed,
- The airlock.
- Yeah.
- The airlock, that's right.
- And we're ready.
- Close the pod bay doors.
Okay we're going.
They just say okay go and it just goes.
Someone was sitting in front of it.
And it wasn't movie, but here we go.
- I'm driving, no hands.
We're not driving, we're not driving.
- We're not driving.
- We have no control over this car.
I don't really know what happens
If you needed to take over.
Maybe that's a question we'll
ask him, like what happens?
-  That's a good question,
because there is no steering wheel,
at least in this one.
- It's going backwards.
We could be going backwards
in the thing whenever,
and you wouldn't even need
to look, because it's,
it's definitely safer
than what we would be in,
I would imagine.
- Absolutely, because
it's looking 360 degrees,
and we can only look so far
at one given time.
You know Dan, I knew at
some point in my life
I'd be driving in an autonomous car
and I also knew, that
it'd probably be with you.
- Hey, there we go.
(laughing)
Only the best for you.
We shut down the Strip for Jared.
- Well thank you.
They usually shut down
some things when I arrive,
but it's not usually for me.
- Like your hotel room?
- It's anticipation of me,
they're like oh Jared's
coming, shut it down!
- Hide all the hot chocolate.
Can you imagine, some
day a Las Vegas Strip
that just has these cars around.
You just go hop in and it takes you--
-  Where you need to go.
- It would look really cool.
We're going again?
- I guess we're going again,
hey.
- Yeah!
-  Hey Zack.
Hey.
- There he goes.
(laughing)
And that's the thing,
we're experiencing a little
bit of the future right now.
It may not look exactly like this,
but it's gonna be pretty darn close.
You get in a car and
you just go, you know?
- Which I'll tell you, from the aspect
of thinking our kids' future,
- Yeah.
- I'm a little terrified for
when my kids are driving.
There's a lot of kids when
you turn 16 years old--
- Yeah.
- Whoa whoa whoa, we stopped.
- Oh goodness.
- There's like a semi-truck right there.
And I'm like oh are we gonna stop?
And we stopped, I shouldn't doubt it.
-  Yeah.
-  Don't doubt this car.
-  And that goes to the point
that you're trying to say, I imagine.
- Yeah, what if they're
distracted drivers.
A lot of kids are distracted drivers.
They need to put their phones down.
Well in this, the car will
come and pick up your kids,
take them to school,
you know that they're gonna be safe.
- Yeah exactly.
Probably, no not probably,
definitely more safe
than they would be,
especially at their younger ages.
- Yeah.
- When they're learning to drive,
when they're 16, 17, 18,
distractions are a huge thing
and this is avoiding those
and keeping them safe.
- And that's probably one of the things
that a lot of parents,
I know a lot of adults are scared,
they're like oh I'm so terrified,
because even with our Tesla right now,
with level two autonomous,
people are so afraid,
I can't believe you would ever use that,
my wife doesn't even use it.
- Really?
- But if you're at level five,
you would think that you would be scared
if somebody ever drove a regular car again
or even a level two autonomous car.
(laughs)
-  You may exit.
- We fogged it up in here.
We were too excited.
- Yeah we did.
(laughing)
- Oh Ellie I'm sorry, it
wasn't like that I promise.
It's not what you think.
We were talking about cars, autonomy.
- Talking about cars gets
Jared really excited, heated.
- Sorry we fogged it up
in there a little bit,
sorry Mercedes.
- Daddy!
-  Dad!
- Hi bud, how's it going?
- Where are you?
- I'm in Las Vegas, by all the Tesla cars.
-  Whoa.
- Is that so cool?
- Uh-huh.
Are you having a good day?
-  Uh-huh.
- I sure miss you.
-  Yeah, I sure miss you.
- Can I have a kiss?
-  That was a scary kiss.
My roast and potatoes and carrots
turned out amazing.
The gravy, I'm getting
ready for my second portion.
I just had a huge plate.
Just talked to Jared,
I'm getting ready to have another plate.
I am so proud of Jared.
When I first met Jared,
he was such a tech guy
and he is such a tech guy
and all the jobs he's had before YouTube
has been tech-related.
And I'm just proud that he's able
to go and do something,
and be a part of something
and speak for someone
that totally is Jared.
I'm so proud that DJI would want
to be a part of the
Ellie and Jared family,
like how they wanted to
film a commercial last year
and how they want him
to speak at this event.
It says a lot, and it's
amazing thing to have
on our resume,
and I'm just really proud of Jared
that he's able to go
and do something so fun.
Also, cherry on top,
hanging out with Tesla,
he's hanging out with Zack and Dan
is always so fun.
I'm just so happy for Jared right now.
I love you so much Jared,
I'm so proud of you.
And the first meal, the
first roast I ever made
was awful, and unfortunately he's not here
for the best roast I've ever ever made
in our whole marriage.
(laughs)
So amazing and tender and awesome so,
you missed out Jared.
You missed out.
- Well as much fun as that was,
it's four in the morning and
it's pretty chilly outside,
so I think we should
probably get some sleep
before we have to be back
at the convention center.
What time do you have to be there?
- I have to be there in four hours.
- In four hours, so we'll get some sleep
and then get back to it.
- It's Vegas, I don't
think people ever sleep
in Vegas, including us.
- Yeah, I guess that's true,
why are we even thinking
about going to sleep.
- Yeah, who needs sleep?
- Let's go hit the slots.
- Wait a minute.
- Blackjack, no?
- No.
- Okay, we'll go to sleep.
