- Baby--
- Brother.
- Baby brooother.
(laughs)
- Mm-mm-mm.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Let's go!
- Are you stopping in the mirror
and being like, oh wow.
- Move it!
-  That's his eyeballs right there
and that's his little nose.
-  That's his eye
socket and his little--
-  Yeah.
- Are we gonna see baby brother today?
- No babies here.
- Is he gonna come out?
- He's not gonna come out,
but we're gonna go to--
-  We're gonna go look at pictures.
- And we're gonna see
him in my belly moving.
- Mmm-hmm.
So we've actually got a few
doctor's appointments today.
- Today's doctor appointment day.
-  Yes it is.
- It's cut pre-cancerous
out of your back day.
-  Yes.
- It's scrub your teeth day.
-  Yes.
- And it's check on baby boy day.
- Yeah, so Ellie is going to the doctor
to cut out more of the melanoma stage mole
and I don't envy you one bit.
I hope they don't cut out too much--
When I got mine cut out here,
recovery was annoying
- Oh yeah.
and now they're gonna
dig deeper on your back.
- Yeah, it's weird because as it heals,
it itches like crazy.
I guess it could be like any
other scab, I don't know.
But it's so deep, it hurts.
- Well it's deep, yeah.
- My mom's like, are they gonna have
to do a stitch in your back?
-  I don't know.
- We'll see, but it's crazy.
- We'll have to see.
(mock retching)
-  Okay, Calvin can you show us
your super cat speed?
-  Say it and run.
-  Oh you gotta say it.
You gotta say it to work.
- Guys he's so shy.
-  I know.
- He came in our room this morning
and goes super cat speed
and then ran out.
- And then ran out.
(Jared laughs)
- Gah.
He doesn't like--
He knows when we're filming.
-  Mmm-hmm.
- So we've got a busy day today.
Mom's at the doctor's right now
and I want to tell you when Mom gets home
her back is probably
gonna hurt pretty bad.
So we need to be extra extra
nice to Mom today, okay?
- Okay.
- And then we're all
gonna go to the dentist
and the dentist (chomp),
they're gonna clean our teeth.
The dentist is gonna clean
Mommy's and Daddy's teeth
and make sure they're extra nice
and strong and clean.
And then, after that, we're gonna go
to the doctor and we're gonna
see our little baby brother.
Baby--
- Brother.
- Baby brooother.
(laughing)
(bright music)
(clapping)
(Calvin laughing)
- Your guy's face is dry, so I have to--
oh don't put it in your hair Cal ah!
Mommy and Daddy are going to the dentist,
and you guys can maybe watch a show
while we're at the dentist office.
Is that okay guys?
Can you be good?
- Give us a thumbs up.
Yeah.
- Oh you're so warm, wow.
Okay we are rushing from
appointment to appointment today,
until we're all done with appointments.
I got stitches in my back.
- Mm-mm-mm.
(Ellie laughs)
- Let's go!
- Are you stopping in the mirror
and being like oh wow.
- Move it!
Jackson, where does he get that?
I promise we do not look in the mirror
and do crap like that.
- I promise you don't look
in the mirror and do that.
- I got an inch cut out of my back,
I have a few stitches in there
and he said to be really
careful the next few days,
so I don't upset it or open it up.
He's like just and take it easy.
And I go back in a month
to do my ingrown toenails.
So this is the year of taking care
of our bodies, our mental
health and our babies.
- Hey Ellie, are you
watching anything on TV?
-  No!
I'm closing my eyes.
- You're closing your eyes?
We're at the dentist office right now,
and Ellie's next door.
The kids are playing in the front area
with the receptionist.
I changed my mind.
I'm gonna watch something on the TV.
When I was a kid, this was all you wanted.
And it never was a thing.
-  You had to count
holes in the ceiling.
- Yeah exactly, you just looked at
all the marks on the ceiling.
Uh-oh,
-  How many light bulbs are there?
-  please wait and
try again, maybe I won't.
- When scheduling appointments,
you always schedule them
not so close together
and that's exactly what I did today,
but it just seems like
one after the other,
it's like get in the car, run.
Our teeth are clean and sparkly.
But you know what?
Smile.
But you know what?
- It was the most embarrassing
dentist appointment
I've ever had in my life.
- We both need to go back
and we both need some dental work.
- I've had fillings done before,
I've had fillings, but
I've never had it be like
okay, you need to get
three cavities filled,
like you need three cavities--
-  Four.
- Four, was it four?
Ahhhh.
- He's like they're so small,
he's like I just would rather
get them taken care of,
before they evolve to something bigger,
and it's like I have never
had that happen before.,
What the heck?
They said our teeth
look really good, but--
and you know what?
- Obviously not.
- I scheduled my next
dentist appointment though
for six months, for my cleaning
and we will have a
just a few week old baby,
- A one month old?
- Not even, a few week old baby.
Maybe it'll be a month.
- Oh my goodness.
We'll have a month old baby
and I was thinking in my head
of feeding, because I
scheduled Jared and I,
I was like okay, how do we do this
with a newborn again?
Let me do this time,
I was thinking of all the stuff, so.
-  You haven't thought about that.
- Yeah, crazy, I was like oh wow,
I'm gonna have a newborn,
we're gonna have a newborn.
- You know what I am proud of though?
- What?
- I haven't missed a day of flossing
since our last dentist appointment.
- What?
- And I still have those frickin cavities.
(gentle guitar music)
Now look, up on that TV,
that's where we're gonna see brother.
So let's look and we'll see
if we can see brother, okay?
-  There's his body.
-  Oh he's doing hand
stands like you guys do.
-  Hi.
-  Jackson, do you see his butt?
-  Oh my goodness,
do you see his leg and foot?
There's his leg.
-  Can you see the baby?
-  I saw the foot.
There's the baby's eyes.
(Jared laughing)
-  It kinda looks like it.
Those look like two round objects.
-  Those are his feet.
-  Yeah.
(heartbeat)
(gentle guitar music)
See that right there?
That's his spine, that's his spine,
that's right here on you.
And right here on you.
Yeah, hey here's confirmation.
There it is.
(Jared laughs)
Yep.
-  It's a baby boy.
-  That's a baby boy.
Do you see the baby's arm?
-  Is that the smile?
-  Is that the smile?
(gentle guitar music)
That's his eyeballs right there
and that's his little nose.
Do you see that guys?
Do you see his head?
-  Aww, that's so cute.
I've never seen that.
- Drinking the amniotic
fluid, that's so cool.
It's time for a celebration.
Not only did we see our camera shy baby
today at the ultrasound, oh my goodness.
I don't know if it was a
Braxton-Hicks contraction or what?
- She said I was having a
Braxton-Hicks contractions,
that wasn't helping the case.
-  And he's so low.
- And his head is right here.
(Jared laughs)
She's like, I can't.
She's like your bone's in the way.
I'm like--
- Uuuh.
- Baby's head is right here,
but his bum bum's here.
-  Yep.
- Great.
-  Yeah, you saw him.
- Yeah, so we saw baby brother.
And Calvin just went pee in the potty
it's time to celebrate.
And we're celebrating
by having a bath bomb
in the bath today.
Do you hear that buddy?
You're getting a bath bomb.
And I'm getting the spotlight,
right where I belong.
In the spotlight, ahhhh.
Boogedeegoogedeeboo!
Let me just say and I gotta say it, Ellie,
The Flash is getting pretty good, okay?
We were a little hesitant at first,
there's some goofy stuff
and that's the whole thing--
- There's some stupid episodes.
(Jared laughs)
- The thing is, there's
some really cheesy stuff,
but this whole seasons,
the whole Devoe.
- Oh my gosh.
- So good.
- So much better than a speedster villain.
- Kid Flash?
- Listen, we like The Flash a lot.
- We love it, but I hate it.
- It's a love hate relationship.
- It's good though right now,
so it's a thumbs up.
- Yeah definitely a thumbs up from us.
The kids are in bed.
We are having a Flash marathon.
And that's where we're gonna
end the night, I'm sorry.
No, sorry, not sorry.
We're ending the night with The Flash.
Thank you Barry Allen for saving the day.
And we will see you guys tomorrow
on the next episode of Barry Allen,
the fastest man alive.
- I'm Barry Allen and I'm
the fastest man alive.
- Thanks for watching guys
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
