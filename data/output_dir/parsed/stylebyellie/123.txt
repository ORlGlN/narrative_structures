(cheery music)
- Oh,
my,
goodness!
My office!
Calvin, my office.
(laughs)
Do you guys remember that toy
that Penny was chewing on?
Well, I'm sad to say
he's no longer with us.
We cannot get toys with cotton inside them
because, oh my goodness,
would you look at that.
Is this crazy, Calvin?
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
I'll be right back, I've
gotta clean that up.
That's a lot.
Poor little guy, didn't even
stand a chance against Penny.
She's got some chompers.
She's got some chompers.
I'm going to clean this up
and we're going to take
Penny on a nice long walk.

- My goodness gracious, boys,
it's kind of a gloomy day today isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Lots of cloud coverage.
I feel like we might get
snow here pretty soon,
in the next week or so.
Do you guys like snow?
- Yeah.
- What do you like to do in the snow?
- Ski.
- Ski (gasps)
Should we go skiing this year?
That would be so much fun.
- But there's not enough
snow on the mountain.
- Not yet, we gotta get more snow,
but it think it's, I feel
likes it's gonna snow
this week, sometime, I
haven't looked at the weather,
but I would love for it to do that
right around Thanksgiving time.
That would be a lot of fun.
So, Ellie is out, she is
in a meeting right now,
and so the boys and I
are having a little trip.
Penny, you're an honorary boy today.
We're taking Penny for a walk
and we're just gettin'
some fresh air outside,
and we're gonna have a little fun.
Father and sons outing.
(cheerful music)
-  Got one?
- Yeah.
(guitar music)
- We better go to our house to warm,
to warm me up.
- Are you getting cold?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Really cold.
- Really cold?
- Yeah.
- Alright, so we'll start heading back.
- Calvin wants to be just like Penny,
running through the weeds.
Look at him go.
- I just got home from the morning
and I got home and no one was here.
Jared, you took the boys
and Penny on a walk.
- We've been busy this morning.
- Were the boys in the stroller?
- No
- or walk
- They were just exploring,
Calvin is just like Penny, he's like,
I'm running through these fields
and I don't care who sees me.
(Ellie laughs)
So he's like.
- Jared just said, he's like,
oh I got the boys in the car,
I'm gonna take 'em to lunch.
I was like,
can I come?
So, I just got home and
I'm gonna go to lunch.
- Yeah.
- This is a nice surprise.
- This is fun.
- Do you guys remember
the other day, I was,
I vlogged a little bit
of me, like, picking up.
I am one to really
like, I like my routine,
I really like picking up, but lately,
I just haven't had it in me, and like,
it's not even bad, it's not even bad.
It's just life, but
it's not my normal life.
So, it's just weird to see like
there's laundry everywhere,
there's dishes everywhere.
- Wo, wo wo wo
- My bed isn't made
- Wo, there's dishes everywhere?
- You did them today.
- When you walked in here,
it was messy this morning,
- You did them.
- It was really messy this morning.
And I think you did
all of this right here.
- I did, I did.
- All of this was a disaster.
- And you picked it up.
I'm not trying to say right now.
- I'm just sayin'
- Okay, let's go.
- Give credit where credit is due!
- Jared's gonna take us to lunch,
but what I thought was cute.
I know I'm all over the place.
(Jared laughs)
- I just wanted to show
you guys a little bit
that I don't always clean
and I'm not always together,
I just wanted to show you that,
but now I'm flustered, nevermind, lets go.
-  Hey Jackson,
Daddy said you got
dressed all by yourself.
-  Did you pick
out your outfit today?
And you dressed yourself?
-  You look good.
Calvin, look at him snoring
away, oh my goodness.
-  It's that time of day.
-  You look so cute, Jacks.
Good job dressing yourself.
- Thank you.
(lunch crowd chatter)
-  Hey, are you
trying to wake him up?
You probably should eat.
It's okay, it's okay though.
Um, this says "look out the window"
(laughs)
(bopping music)
- So the last few days
have been Jared and I
doing lots of filming and we decided
lets take the kids out,
lets take them for a date,
spend some really good time with them,
and we are at The Jump Zone.
And we got new socks, ugh,
those stinkers, they got new socks
for this place, that you have to wear,
so instead of wearing your own socks
that are slippery and fun, now it's safe.
- (laughs) Darn it!
Now it's safe.
- Safe but still fun.
(upbeat music)
(clapping to music)
(Ellie laughing)
(Ellie laughing)
- It is so cold in here 'cause
it's really cold outside.
I'm so glad that they turned
the fire on, makes it so warm.
-  Whoa!
(upbeat music)
-  Wo, ho ho!
Whoa.
Land!
Woo hoo hoo.
Was that better?
I pushed and so he'd go a little further.
Can I push you again?
- Yeah.
- K, hold on tight, tight.
Ready?
Go.
Let go!
Good job.
It's kind of scary.
They just opened. (laughs)
- What?
- They just opened for the day.
We're like the only ones here.
Awesome.
(Ellie laughing)
Every time he climbs up, he slides down.
(Jared and Ellie laughing)
-  He's getting mad.
(upbeat music)
(upbeat music)
(rhythmic hand drums and clapping)
(Ellie laughing)
-  Woooooo!
(upbeat music)
-  He keeps shaking his butt.
(Ellie laughing)
Did you see that?
(Ellie laughing)
-  Do you dance, Cal?
(laughing)
-  Boo.
- Ahh!
(Jared laughing)
- Hi buddy.
- Hi.
- Oh my goodness.
- Jackson, I think we had
a pretty great day today.
- Yeah.
- Did you have fun?
What was your favorite part about the day?
- Uh, going to the trampoline zone.
- The trampoline zone, that was fun huh?
- Yeah.
- You did a sweet front flip.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're pretty brave you know that?
- Mm hmm.
- K, can you say goodnight to our friends?
- Goodnight, poo poo.
- Hey!
Call them our friends.
- Bye, friends.
I need to go to sleep
because I need to go to school tomorrow.
- Oh, okay, goodnight.
- K, goodnight.
(Jared snorts)
-  I would have
been so mad if that hit me.
Ow, that doesn't hurt.
I thought that was going to hurt.
Woo, you got my, ooh, you got it.
Woo, you got my forehead.
(laughing)
- It's okay
- It's okay.
I guess...
I guess that's a wrap.
The kids had a blast at the jump zone,
I loved watching them,
I loved watching you.
- We had fun, I had fun
today with the kids,
like, we really had some
good father son bonding time,
and it was just so fun to be with them,
and I loved it.
- Jared showed me the
clip of Jackson and Calvin
walking together and he's like,
do you know what they're talking about?
I was like, no, and he goes,
they're talking about poop.
Tell them what Jackson said.
- It was Calvin, the one that
Calvin was talking about,
pooping in the toilet, and
Jackson was asking him,
he's like, not in a diaper?
And Calvin said, no, toilet.
It was the cutest thing, like,
and they had this conversation
for like 30 seconds
before they came around that corner.
It was so cute and funny.
If you guys didn't already know,
poop is a pretty discussed
topic in our family.
- I mean, it's always been a topic,
and then we had kids.
- And so it's twice as much.
- And then it exploded,
and now we talk about it all the time.
- It's like, it's just explosive diarrhea.
- We talk about it all the time.
- I'll see myself out.
- And that's, our household is very open,
about anything and everything;
freckles, um...
Did you guys watch that video
when we were in China, the
things that Jackson said.
I haven't looked back at that video.
That went up right?
- Yeah.
His funny sayings?
- Yeah.
Anyway, anyway, anyway, I won't ramble.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
We'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye!
