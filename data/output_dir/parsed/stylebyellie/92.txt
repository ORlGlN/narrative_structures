- You ready to do this?
- Now it's the end of the
busiest, craziest week.
- I know, it's been--
- Emotions.
- It's been an incredible
week, full of emotion.
I think back to when we
were sitting here last year.
We went from one grant
and then that turned
into five grants, and then
that turned into seven grants.
This year we feel so blessed
to have four grants this year.
Thanks to the incredible
donations of Zach from
JerryRigEverything, yeah you can,
the University of Utah, and
the Utah Fertility Center.
We started doing this because
we wanted to give back
for all of the incredible
things that we have receive.
This is just one way of giving back.
I'm glad that we're able
to do it for a second year.
I don't know how long
we'll be able to do this.
But as long as we can, we will.
It's exciting that we get to
announce today the winners
of the IVF Grant.
-  Hi, Ellie and Jared.
We're Brad and Courtney from (muffled).
We've been together for 17 years,
married for the last seven.
-  Today we're
filming our IVF video
from the lobby of the
hospital where I work.
For the past 10 years
I've been a NICU nurse
and three nights a week
I get to work deliveries
to help families bring
their babies into the world.
I also get to take care
of the tiniest miracles
who are fighting day in and day out
just so they can go home.
- Hi, I'm Amanda.
- And I'm Brandon.
We're from Jacksonville, Alabama.
After two years of trying to conceive,
Amanda was diagnosed with
PCOS and low ovarian reserve
and I had some other malefactory issues.
-  After the
fourth failed IUI we met
with our doctor again.
Her recommendation was to move to IVF.
-  My name is Miles
and this is my beautiful
wife Jessica.
- About halfway through
one of my IUI attempts
I woke up one morning
actually partially blind.
I couldn't see, but after
a couple weeks of tests
I was actually diagnosed
with Multiple Sclerosis.
- My name's Mike and this is my wife Abby.
We've been married for almost 11 years.
We participated in foster
care, had four kids come
through our house.
None of it's kind of set
or settled in the way
that we thought it should
be or that we had planned
or even that we thought
the Lord would have it be.
- Okay it is just about time.
We are going to make a
phone call or a Skype call
to the very first couple
that we are making
this announcement to.
I am just so excited to do this.
This is the best part
about doing these grants
is letting them know.
(voice is muffled)
- Hi.
- Hi guys, how are you?
- Good, how are you?
- Good, we did have a
question that we wanted to get
some additional information.
But the real reason that
we called is that we want
to let you know that you guys won a grant.
- No.
- Yes.
Congratulations guys.
We also wanted to let you
guys know that we have
chosen you as one of the grant winners.
- Thank you.
(laughing)
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Most of the reason
that we wanted to call is
we wanted to let you
know that we have chosen
you guys to be grant winners.
(laughing)
The main reason that we
wanted to call is we wanted
to let you guys know that
you were selected to be
IVF Grant winners.
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you so much.
-  You are so welcome guys.
- And you are so deserving of this.
It was so fun telling them.
This has been a crazy and
I feel like I don't know.
I hope people understand
the process and know
how crazy it is for everyone
that submitted their stories.
It's like are we even
equipped to doing this?
Hearing everybody's stories
this week, we laughed with you,
we cried with you.
It changes us.
- Absolutely.
Who would have thought that
two minutes you could say
so much and sometimes
just seeing your eyes,
you would feel so much?
And in a happy, positive
way and a sad, you just want
to hug that person way.
Just this full range of
emotions that we experienced.
We feel so much closer
to you as a community
because of this.
- We've been filming for four years.
There are still days where we
don't know what we're doing.
There are still days
where I turn on the camera
and I don't even know what to say.
Sometimes I'm awkward still.
We're just all growing, but
this experience has truly
just been an eye opener.
It's weird because there's
so many people that watch us
that are strangers, and there's
so many people that watch us
that are not strangers
that know us personally,
neighbors, everything.
Sometimes I'm like I don't know,
I feel a little funny sometimes,
but I'm just grateful that
this is what we've been able
to do with our platform
that we never even thought
would turn into a platform.
It's crazy.
- I just feel like you
said we have this platform
and if we didn't take the
opportunity to do good,
even just a little bit, we
wouldn't be utilizing it
the way that we should.
Whether that's donating to Toys for Tots
or doing this IVF Grant,
I feel like this is now
a part of who we are and
I'm so grateful for it.
It's just been wonderful.
We are really appreciative
of our family this week.
This has been a wonderful
experience, but it has put
a crazy weight on our shoulders.
I hope that everyone
around us has understood
our shortcomings and
our lack of being there
it's been a crazy week.
Anyway, I'm gonna stop
boobing, but we're just really
grateful for our family that supported us
and has understood just the process.
- Yeah, because it does
take a lot of time.
I mean hundreds and
hundreds of people applied
and we watched hundreds
and hundreds of videos.
- And all of your stories
resonated with us.
I hope that nobody goes
away from this regretting
sharing their story with us.
I hope nobody goes away from this.
Of course they are going
to go away from it sad.
How can you not?
Even we are.
We kept saying oh I wish
there could have been more.
I wish there could have been 100 more.
- I wish we could give a grant to everyone
because I said before the
hardest part about this
is that everyone is deserving of this.
But also the easiest part is that everyone
is deserving of this.
I just wish that we had
the capacity to do more,
to give more.
I know there's going to
be a lot of people who are
so broken-hearted about this.
But you know every year
we try harder and we try
to do more.
- We're so grateful for
everybody, even the videos.
It's like we don't deserve
this just as anyone else,
so good luck in your decision making.
Everyone said that.
- I can't believe how
many people said that.
- And how thoughtful that was and caring.
So we appreciate everybody's
kind words towards us.
- It just goes to show
how good people are.
I'm so grateful for that.
So with that there you have it.
The IVF Grant winners.
Thank you for another wonderful year.
This is going to be an
incredible journey for those
four lucky couples.
We're going to get to know
them and it's going to be
very exciting.
Thank you guys so much for
watching the video today.
We will see you guys in
a couple hours, actually
because another video is going up.
So thank you guys and we'll
see you next time, bye.
