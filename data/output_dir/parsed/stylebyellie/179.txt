(bright uptempo music)
- Good morning guys, happy Monday.
It is feeding time.
Ahhh, come on little birdies.
(smacks lips)
Ah wait.
- This is how come
mommy's always eat last.
I offer food and they say no,
and then when I eat, they want to eat.
Oh.
(laughing)
- Ellie you know what you need to do,
you need to chew it up
in your mouth first,
- Eww.
- before you give it to them
- so they can swallow it better.
- Okay, that's too much.
(Jared laughing)
- You went too far.
(gentle guitar music)
- Oh no Jackson, are you okay?
What happened?
- I broke my knee.
-  You broke your knee?
Oh no.
What did you tell me we need to do?
- I need to go to the doctor.
-  Do you think
the doctor will be able
to help your knee feel better?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, I think we should do that.
Can I take a look at it real quick?
- Yeah.
- Oh ouch buddy, that looks like it hurts.
Okay, I think I know just the place.
Will you come with me and
we'll go see a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Okay, but don't put
too much weight on it,
okay, we just got to
make sure it stays okay
until we see the doctor.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Are you gonna be alright?
Okay, let's walk to our bedroom
and I'll go get dressed, and
we'll go see the doctor, okay?
Oh that's a bad limp.
Oh man, I think it switched legs,
but that's still bad.
Oh there it goes,
oh man, I knew it was bad.
This is serious business.
We've got to go see the doctor right now.
What do you think Mom?
I think it's pretty serious.
Maybe not the doctor, maybe
the Ministry of Silly Walks.
(audience laughing)
- Jackson that looks really bad.
Does it hurt?
- Yes.
- Here, walk to the couch.
Let's see how good you do it.
- Oh, ouch that looks painful.
- Do you want Daddy to carry you?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
-  Okay.
-  Oh careful.
- Yeah, oh is it tender?
- Yes.
- Let me go get dressed
and I'll take you, okay?
You just stay right next to me,
and don't you walk another step, okay?
- I will.
- You will, why?
Well don't you think
that will hurt your knee?
- No.
- Okay.
Do you want me to put you down?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Careful.
-  Careful.
-  Be careful Jackson.
Jackson be careful.
Oh.
(ambulance siren)
Is there a doctor in the house?
Please, I need a doctor!
(coughing)
- Oh no, did you get a cough too?
You look pale.
Are you gonna be okay?
- Did somebody call for a doctor?
-  Yes, we need a doctor.
He's even is getting a cough.
I think his leg needs to be looked at.
-  What seems
to be the problem son?
-  You tell him what's wrong.
- My knee hurts.
- Your knee hurts.
Let me take a look at it, is that okay?
Let me have you sit up.
-  Careful he has a cough too.
- I will be so careful.
How old are you young man?
- Three.
- Three?
Is it this knee?
- Yeah.
- Or is it this knee?
This one right here, okay.
I'm just gonna apply some pressure here.
How does that feel?
-  Good.
- Good, does it hurt a little bit?
- Yeah.
- Did you here that?
-  Did you pop it in place?
-  Did you hear that?
- Yes.
- Oh I don't know.
Let me take a look at a couple things.
I want to hear your heartbeat.
Let's try here.
(heartbeat)
Sounds pretty good.
Will you open your mouth
and stick out your tongue?
Say ahh.
- Ahhh.
- Yeah, looks okay.
Let me check you for a temperature.
Open your mouth.
Uh-huh, ooh.
-  Oh.
- Just as I thought, a little warm.
Not too high though.
Okay, now this, this is
a reflex hammer, okay?
I'm gonna hit your knee
and we'll see what happens.
- Ow.
Owww.
Ow.
- Did you see that?
Did you see your leg move?
Let's see, so this right
here is a special shot
that's gonna make you feel better, okay,
and I'm gonna put it right on your arm.
Okay?
And I'm gonna wrap up your leg,
so it feels much better okay?
There we go.
- Is this gonna stay on me?
- It's gonna stay on your
for about a week and a half.
You'll just take it off for baths
and everything, but it'll
keep you nice and supported,
while you are running
around and playing, okay?
-  That way when you
ride your bike, it won't hurt.
- That's too much.
- Too much?
-  Uh-huh.
- Okay.
How does that look, pretty good?
-  Say thank you doctor.
- Thank you doctor.
- You're welcome son,
just be careful when you're playing, okay?
-  Okay.
- We don't want any
more injuries like this
that can be prevented.
Oh there's one more thing.
-  How's waking?
- Its great.
-  Oh good.
- Alright, give me your arm.
Put your arm right through here.
We want to keep our arm right here.
- Are you a daddy doctor?
- I'm a daddy doctor.
Okay keep your arm down like that.
- Are you my daddy doctor?
- I'm your personal daddy doctor.
Keep your arm right here.
-  Aw, you look like
you're in good shape now.
- Do you feel a little better?
- Yeah.
- Good, I'm glad.
-  Thanks daddy doctor.
- You're welcome.
- What's this?
- This is my mask, so I don't
get any airborne illnesses.
-  Give Daddy a hug, say thanks.
- You feel better?
- Yeah.
- Oh not with that arm.
You've got to keep your arm in place.
You'll get tennis elbow
until you're sixty.
- I need this off.
- Okay, when you're all healed up,
you can take it off, okay?
Now you listen to your parents
and follow the instructions
that I give them, okay?
I'm sensing a little something.
I'd like to check over here.
(heartbeat)
Just as I thought,
sounds like you're suffering
from a broken heart.
(Ellie laughs)
Let me give you a hug to
make that feel better.
- Thank you.
I like daddy doctors.
(laughing)
Do you need a check up too Cal?
- Yeah, let's take a look.
Here you can just sit right here.
Ready?
-  Ooh.
-  Hey daddy doctor?
- Oh, did you see that?
-  Yep.
-  What were you singing?
Sing that one more time for me.
♫ One two three four five six
♫ Seven eight nine
♫ Commandments
♫ The ten duel commandments

(laughing)
What is that from?
- Hamilton.
- Hamilton.
That is so funny, Jackson
just started singing this,
I don't know, like three or four days ago,
and every time I hear him,
I get this big smile on my face.
♫ One two three four five six
♫ Seven eight nine
♫ the mandments
♫ Ten duel commandments
(laughing)
You are so awesome.
Do you like to sing?
- Yes.
-  Yeah, what
songs do you like to sing?
- Hamilton.
- Yeah, you know how me and
Grandpa sing songs together?
- Uh-huh.
- Wouldn't it be fun if you and me
sang a song together?
- I want to go pole vaulting.
- And you want to go pole vaulting?
- Yes.
- Jackson you are making my
dreams as a father come true.
Thank you so much,
I can get so emotional and teary eyed.
(Jackson yells)
But honestly I think that is something
Jackson and I should do,
just like me and my dad do.
What do you think?
Should we do a song?
And if so, what song do
you think we should do?
I'd love to know your thoughts
about a song that Jackson
and I could do together.
Let me know in the comments down below.
I have a couple of ideas,
but I want to hear what you think.
Do you know a song you want to do?
♫ One two three four five six
♫ Seven eight nine
Ten Duel Commandments.
- I want to do that one.
- Okay.
I am continually blown away
by the generosity of others,
like seriously, our neighbors
have been so amazing.
We just got dropped off a meal
by one of our sweet sweet neighbors,
already made and ready to eat.
Are you guys ready for this?
Okay we're gonna say a prayer first,
but thank you for the generosity.
Everyone has been so awesome.
You are already eating
before we said the prayer?
Well you're a silly
monkey pants, aren't ya?
Say Heavenly Father,
thank you for this day.
- Heavenly Father, thank you for this day.
-  Thank you for our blessings.
- Thank you for the blessings.
-  Please bless the food.
- Please bless the food.
-  That will make us strong.
- That will make us strong.
-  Bless us to have a good night.
- Bless us to new night.
-  And we say this?
- Amen.
-  Amen.
- Okay, let's eat.
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Okay.
("Don't Let Me Down" by The Beatles)
♫ Don't let me down
♫ Don't let me down
♫ Don't let me down
♫ Don't let me down
♫ Don't let me down
That was fun, huh?
- Yeah.
(Calvin singing)
-  Get in bed, come on.
Grab your car.
Come on.
- Yeah.
-  Go get in bed.
- Wait waita waita
wait a minute, I'm sorry, what?
What are these Ellie?
- My sweet neighbor made
those cheesecake bites.
-  Is this the same
neighbor that brought us dinner?
-  Yep.
-  There's
strawberries, frozen cheesecake
and then like granola stuff
at the bottom of this?
- Yeah.
- This is amazing.
- This is what we're doing.
We're going to watch a movie
and we're gonna have these cake pops,
because that looks delicious.
Look at that, how fun is that?
And then guess what?
Dr. Mecham can use those little sticks
as tongue depressors.
-  Totes.
- So I have to talk to
you about Dr. McSteamy.
His name tag wasn't showing,
but it said McSteamy on there.
He was getting a little
close to you, okay?
And I just didn't like that
he was flirting with you.
- He was just making sure
it was all taken care of.
- That's my job.
- But I won't let that happen again.
- Thank you because when he was checking
your heart rate and everything,
he went in and went straight
for the hug and the kiss.
It's a good thing he was wearing a mask.
I would've had to intervene.
Don't be flirting with doctors Ellie.
Don't be flirting with doctors.
(laughs)
Guys, if you didn't know it, it was me.
I'm Dr. McSteamy.
- And I kissed him.
♫ I kissed a doctor and I liked
- Nevermind
You wouldn't understand.
That kid, Calvin is such a stinker.
He literally came out
and I was like, oh gosh.
So I put him back to bed,
but before he got in the bed,
I was like you need to lay down,
and he stopped in the middle of the room
and laid down on the
floor and just laughed.
He knew exactly what he was doing.
I was like, no, lay in your bed.
And he got up and laid in his bed.
What a kidder, like what
the heck is he thinking
to make a joke at this hour, too.
No but seriously, how funny is that.
I said lay down,
and he laid in the middle of the floor.
Oh my gosh.
Okay, seriously though,
this nighttime routine
is not what we're looking for.
Calvin, get in bed.
It is 11:30 at night,
and we've been watching a couple episodes
of this show Parenthood.
- I like it a lot.
- I'm still kind of
- I'm still getting used
to it and everything.
But I just want to say
that I've had a really
great night with you Ellie.
- You just like cuddling me.
- I do like to cuddle.
- And kissing my neck.
- Yeah that's fun.
(laughing)
But it's been a really enjoyable night
with you and I'm glad
- Love you.
- we're together.
- Love you.
We're gonna end the vlog, thank you guys.
- I'm not angry today.
- I didn't get thrown against
the wall tonight, guys.
- No, not you, the camera.
- We're getting blurry, so
we're gonna call it a night.
Bye.
- Bye.
