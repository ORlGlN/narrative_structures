(pensive music)
- Good morning.
While everybody has a
lame simple breakfast
due to their simple request.
- Or simple taste buds.
- I have the ultimate one.
I packed veggies and tomatoes and cilantro
just so I could have my very own
yummy breakfast burrito.
-  You wanna know how to fold it?
Well you take about half
that out. (chuckles)
-  I want a big one.
-  Yeah, just
like that, that's good.
-  Mom, that's not yours.
-  That sure is, unless you
want to take a bite of it.
(laughs)
So Mom, be honest.
How was last night, how did you sleep?
- I think the first night's
always a little crazy,
like, getting adjusted to
noises, the weather, whatever.
It was good, it was better
than we've had before.
No one threw up or pooped, so we're great.
- We're always off to a better start
than our first couple trips.
- We've had a first few
rough trips in this,
but I think we're good.
-  Yeah, I think we're good.
- Look at that!
- There you go, nice fold.
So, I think one of the
hardest parts about this
is getting the climate set up.
We are in Las Vegas, and it's warm here.
But at the night, it gets a little cool,
not like Utah cold, but our
heater needs to turn on,
and the closer you are to the
window, the colder it gets.
So the person on this
side of the bed gets hot,
that side of the bed gets cold.
So getting that flow going is one thing,
but I also looked, like I
already mentioned yesterday,
on the Facebook group, there's
a Facebook group that I'm on,
they have like these little covers
that you put over the
top of these canopies
that will keep the heat
in, and the cool air out.
So I think that's something that
we should probably invest in.
- Bingo.
-  All right.
- We're ready to go.
-  Let's get a family picture.
There's some amazing places here in Vegas,
and we're gonna take the kids to a park,
and Penny to a park where they can
ride their bikes and play.
I think it's like Red Rock or Red Stone
or something like that.
Hey, will you help me
get your bike in the car?
- Um, no.
-  Oh, are you
gonna help me lift it?
- Nope.
-  Do you want me to lift it?
Oh you're just gonna keep riding.
Oh, I see how it is.
I see how it is.
Jackson is just such a
master at his bicycle.
Like, he has exceeded my expectations.
And he's got a flat tire on the back.
He is just ripping and
railing through those trails
that he has pulled up a flat,
so we are gonna use this,
and we're gonna fill up his bike with air
so he can ride it throughout this trip.
-  It is stunning out here.
The red rock, brown rock, it's so pretty!
-  Look at this over
here, isn't that incredible?
So we made it to the Calico Tanks trail,
and they are not wasting any time.
You guys are crazy!
There's no way Penny and I could do this.
-  Hi!
-  How are you guys?
-  Good.
-  Good, you're crazy,
you're all the way up there!
-  He's like, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
-  (laughs) I'm
just looking up there,
and I'm like holy crap, my
wife is six months pregnant,
she's holding a baby, and she's hiking up
this rock willy nilly.
- I am having anxiety.
Jackson.
-  (laughs) With a little anxiety.
- And this is exactly
why we stay on the trail.
There are cactuses, snakes...
I think they even said scorpions.
-  Ooh.
-  So we have to stay on the trail.
-  Yeah, so
let's stay on the trail,
and we'll have a lot of fun.
Look at how pokey those look.
Those look so pokey.
- Even they're for sharp things.
-  Yes, they are.
-  Look at this tunnel.
-  Is that so cool?
-  Oh, there's a rock right here.
-  Oh, fun!
-  (laughs) There's
a rock right there, guys!
Right there! (chuckles)
-  There's not many of them here.
-  Miss Penn.
-  She has been a rockstar.
-  You, I was very nervous
the moment you got out of the car,
it was a little, woo!
What are we doing?!
-  She's like,
"You guys brought me to
"a national park!
"Let's go have fun, let's go crazy!"
-  She was a little intense.
But she's doing awesome, good girl.
- Wait me!
-  Oh you want me to hold you?
- Uh-huh.
- Parenting fail.
I brought the Ergo, I may
have asked Jared to pack it.
It's in the RV.
-  I left it in the trailer.
My fault.
- Dang it!
-  Look up here!
-  Whoa!
-  This is so you!
-  How do I get on here?
-  Jackson, look!
-  Dad did it, Penny's doing it!
(laughs) Good girl!
-  Wait, wait.
Dad, this for dogs.
-  Yeah, I guess we can keep Penny.
-  'Kay, we'll keep her.
Let's let these guys go first.
-  How did you get up there, Mom?
-  I climbed so fast.
-  Go stand by Jackson.
-  Do you think I'm cute in here?
-  (laughs) Do you
think I'm cute in here.
Of course.
Oh wow, look at this, this is so cool.
-  I love you!
-  I love you.
-  I love me.
-  I love me. (laughs)
-  I love me, too.
(upbeat music)
Come on, girl.
Good girl!
-  All right,
are we doing good, guys?
-  Yep!
-  Are we taking a little pit stop?
-  I think we made it halfway,
and I think this is as far as we'll go.
-  Yeah, but I
just have to show you.
Look at the beautiful valley
we're sitting in, having lunch.
Isn't this incredible?
It's beautiful.
-  It is wonderful.
-  Yeah, its awesome.
-  I feel like we could go further,
like with the rocks, but I don't know.
This is good, halfway's good.
-  Yeah, some--
-  Penny's a
trip, I wanna be grateful
for everything.
-  Yeah, Penny has been
doing really, really great.
Someone's like, "Oh,
you're taking your dog
"all the way up there?"
I was like, "Well, we've
never been here before."
They're like, "Yeah, you may not want to."
(chuckles) So we're like, oh, okay.
So we're taking our pit stop now.
Oh, are those sandwiches good?
Penny might think so, too. (laughs)
-  Yeah, she ate yours yesterday.
-  Yes, she did.
- I've been a good girl.
I did the hike.
I didn't complain.
I put on my sunscreen.
But the one thing I want.
Cookies and cream ice cream.
That just makes me, it looks like
cookies and cream up there.
You don't see it?
-  I don't see it.
-  Oh, boo.
- You know what?
I'll take cookies and cream any day.
-  It looks like
cookies and cream up there.
Kids are, you know, punching sand.
- It's like that soft sand that just feels
so good in your hand.
-  We're just gonna sit here
and see how long they're entertained for.
Penn, so happy you're so good.
-  Doo dah doo
dah dah dah dah dah!
-  Oh my gosh.
That was the police
helicopter, did you see that?
- Yeah.
- Do you think it was
getting someone else?
-  I do, I think
it was picking up someone.
- We saw it land and grab someone.
- Yeah, must've grabbed
someone or something like that.
It's either that or
someone's on the loose.
And they took this trail that we're on.
(chuckles) On the trails with criminals.
Hey Calvin, do you want me to hold you?
- No.
-  No, where are you?
Who do you want to hold you?
- Um, Mom.
-  Mom? Are you sure?
Do you want Jackson?
Hey. (chuckles)
Free spankings.
- You deserve a butt spanking.
-  (laughs) It's not
even your birthday, Calvin,
and you get free spankings.
How wonderful is that?
(laughing)
Blup, blup, blup, blup,
blup, blup, blup, blup.
(kids laughing)
-  Hey, was that a fun horse ride?
-  Yeah.
-  That was fun.
-  I saw horse rides over there,
but this was more, this was cheaper, so.
- Yeah, horseback riding
or Jared-back riding.
The choice is yours.
For the low price of $19.99.
Here we go.
-  Wait for me, Daddaroo!
-  I like walking
Penny when she's tired.
Ha! It's my favorite way to walk her.
-  As much as I'm sure you want to,
you're not allowed to drive.
You don't have a license!
You didn't study for the test and pass it!
You can't sit in this seat.
- She is so tired.
-  She had so much fun, didn't ya?
Oh, remember when you were just a puppy
and you could sleep with me while I drove?
Huh? Do you remember that?
-  We're going to the pool.
-  You excited, boys?
-  Yep!
-  Yep! Enough
hiking, let's start swimming!
-  Yeah!
-  Yeah!
- Blow?
-  What'd you find?
- Um, this.
-  Yeah? Are you gonna blow it?
- Yeah. (blowing)
-  (chuckles) Good job.
Weeds everywhere!
(cheerful music)
-  Calvin, was it too cold?
Was it cold?
(cheerful music)
-  Crab walk again.
This is how you walk when
you're freezing cold.
This pool is beautiful and amazing,
but we are going to
take one teeny, tiny dip
in the hot tub before we go.
Where do you want to put it?
- In the front.
-  'Kay, do you want me to do it?
'Kay, we will put it just right here.
(giggling)
What? Why are you laughing at me?
Oh, I'm Spider-Woman.
Rawr!
As for you...
- I want my dog (mumbles).
-  Your dog can sit right here.
We don't want to lose
your dog at the park.
- No.
-  Kiss him and
say, "I'll come back."
Sometimes it's like, it
doesn't really matter,
he can bring the dog to the park.
But I'm just thinking it's just
more responsibility for me.
'Kay, let's go.
Calvin. 'Kay, hold hands, we'll walk over.
Daddy's gonna grab Penn.
- Hold my hand.
-  Hold my hand.
- 'Kay, see you later, guys.
I gotta hold Jackson's hand.
(playful music)
- Come down the slide with me, guys.
Did it!
-  Hey.
- Hi.
-  How are ya?
- Good, how are you?
-  Good.
-  Hey, uh, you're
pretty cute, what's your name?
-  My name is, my name is Ellie.
Calvin was loving that
Penny was here at the park.
- Oh yeah, he ran, he was like
looking through all the way
to find out how to get out.
-  Oh, oh, and
Penny's loving other dogs.
Do you have to stay on
leash here, right here?
-  Mm-hmm, technically, yeah.
-  Oh.
- But at one point, he was
trying to fit his head through.
He was like, trying to push his head,
because he wanted to come say hi.
-  (laughs) Sorry.
Let's go eat, let's go eat.
Calvin's dog is right there.
I'm gonna see how long it
takes for him to grab it.
He went to go do flips with Jackson.
-  What are they scheming together?
(both laugh)
-  Oh, his shoe fell off.
Where's your dog?
Go bring it to me so we don't lose him.
Go get him!
Don't say cat speed, go get him!
Today was a fun,
successful day in the sun.
And I'm actually really looking
forward to going to bed.
'Cause I know the second
night will always be better.
You can sleep anywhere when you
are almost 25 weeks pregnant
if you have a pregnancy pillow with you.
It like made sleeping so nice.
I love that thing!
A day in the sun is exactly what every
single one of us has needed.
Felt so good, thank you
guys so much for watching,
and we'll see you next time.
Bye!
