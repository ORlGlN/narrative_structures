okay boys do not today is my day to day
use test day exactly
Cindy Emma's dad is gay and he's in
Miami I might I might pee on a stick and
I have a baby in my tummy
and I have been so excited and in the
last few days I have been a little it's
been a little slumber because I just
don't know if it's gonna be positive
yeah the feelings of well what is what
if it's negative what then
yeah and Jared and I are definitely not
naive to this process we know it can
take a lot of time and what's been weird
is or hard is I feel pregnant
I feel pregnant and it could be a little
early depending on everyone's cycle so I
don't know we'll see I'm nervous
there's a lot of feelings and emotions
that go along with this but you know no
matter what happens you know
ah this is our journey yeah and this is
our journey
boobers you little goober I know I guess
you try it
yeah try it Oh stink eye
yeah yeah and tell ago
you try it oh oh there's a club you bet
honey feel be honest um I still nervous
because it's like I don't know I just
feel nervous because in my head I feel
pregnant I will be very optimistic
because you just never know I feel like
the past week you've been very
optimistic excited and just happy and I
feel like since yesterday you've kind of
been second-guessing the test not what
you feel but the test yeah Sheila I
think it's time we should vote okay okay
I'm sorry LM a any phase line I'm using
thicker
I just don't get it I can i I can only
imagine what it feels like to have all
of the things going on in your body like
what you feel and then to see that like
that's not fun
yeah I was thinking about this and I
don't know I I think I'm like you did
this would be like a good analogy and
I'm like Jeju is kind of dumb but I'm
just thinking like you know when we go
on road trips how many times do we
forget something and have to turn back
this is just you know
well you just forgot something and we
got to turn back and grab it up hold it
is I'm not I'm not saying I'm not this
doesn't mean I'm not pregnant right I
mean I was false positive yeah I I'm not
going to say I'm not pregnant until I
have a pyramid orange level what it does
I was going to say you know you can
still do a blood test
I hi this is bike um I don't know what
the right word is this is like it hurts
your mommy just like my boobs don't look
like this unless I'm pregnant her farts
don't smell like that unless she's
pregnant ice Josh my stomach doesn't
feel like this unless I have been
pregnant yeah so that's what that's good
that's got to be confusing yeah that's a
good word I'm doing like I don't get
this so I am a little sad but I'm still
optimistic it's not a journey
unless if you bump in the road right
sounds good okay I love you 11:2 and I'm
so glad we're doing this together and
I'm so glad we're documenting them and
we've said what we said you know to
whether I'm not pregnant it'll be like
oh well that was a crazy thing but I
even woke up again today again and every
day I'm like my boobs are getting bigger
like that's just not a coincidence that
doesn't happen
so figure it all ran we'll of course
yeah I mean we just we've encountered
this a lot it's the same feeling every
time is just okay well there's that this
is just the beginning okay yeah if you
guys wanted to see this is the pregnancy
test right there I mean it's just just
one I don't even see any traces of
anything else there all right so I just
talked to all my sisters and my mom and
Jerry sister Jen said that her first
test for her baby was negative and she's
like today I see and then Emily of my
brother's wife said that she took four
pregnancy tests that were negative
before she um got a positive with Henry
so I am very very hopeful and I'm not
going to be sad because I feel pregnant
and then if I and if I really really am
NOT I'm not going to be sad we're just
gonna keep trying ma'am
right mr. Jack that's what we did with
you you know that made you have a dad
and I got so many negative tests this is
you're so sad and then I got pregnant
with you it was the best thing ever
you changed our lives um no way and I
was mad yeah as I'm still mums
is a like an owl yeah you punch you
punch that PCOS away and you said I'm
coming anyway huh that's what you did
are you happy to be in our family now
yeah well we were going to make
breakfast this morning I was like all my
nerves I can't so I think what we should
do is we should go out and eat because I
don't want to cook we should go out and
we should be pancakes and oatmeal at
homes so it's the best breakfast place
in town or the crepe braids that have
good places to have good crepes
sure go eat oh wait I go P John gone the
weapon I go to summer carry and he is
that what you did out of fuel I never
asked if they went to the cemetery can't
remember where it was but he thinks that
he went to the cemetery oh stop I can't
remember where Jason went on the show go
baby was number two wasn't the center
where they got lucky
okay well let's go eat
I want to do that I have a little bird
oh no that was very cute
look how pretty that dog looks guys that
a pretty dog yeah something like that we
are going to sit down and we're going to

enjoy Santa's going to bed oh you are
laughing so hard you can't even run
straight run Jackson run the naked
babies coming to get you so I know you
have a headache

just got back from Hawaii still trying
to cope with life thanks for coming over
and cutting my hair I wanted to amuse
you go ahead so my hair guys wait real
quick look how long it is yes it's
stinking long it is pretty it needs a
trim for sure because it's dry very dry
been doing actually conditioner on it
for like 20 minutes before I wash it
usually always just like hydrate the
ends but it's time for a good trim so
that's your time for a good color but
we'll just start that cut today Penny's

and I am I'm sitting here editing I'm
doing lots of thinking and pondering and
going over the day specifically in just
our family journey and I was thinking
that you know even though we have a
negative test result today Ellie and I
are still very hopeful for the future
and that's exciting you know today was
kind of a sad day but our spirits are
still high we're still doing
and another thing that I was thinking
about I'm so glad we've been documenting
this and I'm so glad that we'll have
this video to look back on and relive
the beginning of this journey and it all
starts right here and this is just a
bump in the road and then we're going to
keep driving forward so you guys are
