-  The hardest thing
about it, there's not much
you can do or say to change anything.
Knowing that some people can
benefit from our experience
I think helps us go through it too.
- I'm sitting here waiting
for everybody to get home
from church and I've kind
of been taken back with how
I have been feeling physically.
My doctor told me that
every two to three hours
I need to get up and walk around.
I'm not one to lay in bed
even if I can and so I have
gotten up several times
because I feel good and then
I'm like "yup I need to
lay down, I need to lay
"down right now," and I
had a lot of cramping today
and so I've been trying to take it easy.
I did get up once back up
for a long time and then I've
been laying down the rest
of the day and I'm just
surprised I didn't realize
how much it would take a toll
on me not only emotionally but physically.
But I'm ready for my family
to be home from church.
I miss them, they've only
been gone a few hours
but I looked in the mirror
and I look really pale
and I kinda have a raspy
voice so I think I need to
get some food in me, some water,
and rest a little bit more.
- We just got back from church and I am
making dinner today.
I'm making like a hardy
chili for Ellie and right now
I'm watching it sizzle
and I'm making it curl
with these vegetables.
(Jeopardy music)
One delicious hardy chili meal check.
One sweet sweet mamma who may
have overdone it yesterday.
- Thank you, I don't feel
like I overdid it yesterday.
I think it was this morning.
-  It was this morning you did it?
Okay well either way, I
made you this meal full
of nutrients, health,
protein and energy for you.
- Thank you.
- Can I have some marshmallows?
- You can have some of those marshmallows.
It's sour cream.
These are healthy marshmallows.
(laughing)
Do you like those marshmallows?
It's because it's sour cream.
- He hates sour cream too.
-  I'm not a big fan of
sour cream either Jackson,
do not even worry.
- There's beans in here?
-  Mhm.
- That's great, thank you.
-  There's beans, peppers,
scallions, pork, cheese,
sour cream and--
- I've been eating cinnamon
rolls for four days straight.
I'm so grateful, my
cousin made them for me.
- And they're like honestly
some of the best cinnamon
rolls I have had in my
entire life, thank you guys.
- They are very good.
-  Okay you enjoy that.
Hey boys I've got your plates
outside if you would like
to join me, we will have dinner together.
- Let's see if Calvin likes it.
-  Okay.
- There you go.
-  Take a bite!
(crying)
- You don't want a bite?
-  Is it hot, he says it's hot.
- Here let me blow on it.
-  Let mom blow on it firstw.
- This is a yummy bite.
-  Oh this is cool.
Oh rejected!
Run away Calvin!
- Now hold it and show Penny,
see because it's recording,
so show Penny.
(baby babbling)
-  Cavlin!
- Huh, huh?
- I'm filming!
Cheese.
Morning guys, good morning guys!
Dad I see you with this camera!
- Hi bud, how are ya?
-  Good!
- Did you have fun at church today?
-  Uh huh.
- Good.
-  Yeah.
-  Is Calvin going crazy over there?
-  Yeah!
(baby babbling)
(mom and dad cheering)
Yeah!
-  Good job!
-  Yay!
-  Do another one!
(gentle music)
- So our sweet friends Angie
and Blake came over today
and we had a long chat with
them, if you guys didn't
know they're one of our
IVF couples and I just have
to say those guys are the best.
We're in constant communication
on like, we have like
a Facebook chat that we've
all been talking to each other
and like keeping each
other updated on things
and telling things about miscarriages,
pregnancy updates,
pregnancy announcements,
and it's kind of fun to
have this group where we can
talk and I'm just really
glad where we kept up with
our new family through
the internet, the internet
is an amazing place as
you guys already know,
because we're communicating though the
power of the internet, thanks Buggy.
But I have to show you what
they brought because it was
just so sweet.
They have a basket of
oranges and apples and
there's meaning behind it and they wrote
these letters to us
and they gave us a book
called "Tear Soup" and
they brought some stuff
for the kids, some
monster truck toys and a
monster truck book.
So the meaning of the apple
is it's an ancient food
that brings us back to the source.
It's one of the very first
foods to have comforted us.
So apples connect us to
a sense of sanctuary.
Makes them ideal for when
you're feeling depressed,
alienated, invalid,
powerless, useless, worthless,
you get the idea.
If the time ever comes
when you feel you aren't
being validated, eating apples
can help change your course.
And oranges or like a
tangerine is liquid sunshine.
If you often feel sad,
weepy and glum down,
oranges cut through the gloom and shine
a light on your life.
It was just very sweet
so to our IVF couples
thank you guys for thinking
of us and doing that.
We love you and we support
you and you mean the
world to us, so thank you.
And one of the best things
in the whole entire world
that you can have with apples.
- Caramel.
-  Caramel!
Delicious?
- It's one of my favorite treats.
Yeah.
- I've had a lot of rage.
-  Oh Ellie, you're
gonna make me cry.
It has been a hard day and
I think that is just kinda
like Ellie said, it's
gonna be a roller coaster
and that's what it's been like.
- If I was holding you, you
would've gone through that wall.
- Not just the camera.
Okay so I know it's that
direction that I would go.
- It's been like, you
literally have to mentally
like keep yourself safe,
like I'm not doing very
hot right this second.
-  I'm sorry honey.
- It's okay.
- Your hormones are
going through craziness,
what a mental, physical,
emotional change that
you've gone through this
week, that we've gone through.
The hardest thing about it
I think from my perspective
is that there's not much
you can do or say to
change anything, to make, it just better.
- Yeah there's nothing I
can do or say to even help
myself, it's just like
well (bleep), this sucks.
What the hell happened this week?
But it happened and you just
deal with it and grateful
for friends who bring sweet treats.
-  Yeah absolutely.
And like I said earlier,
I think just knowing that
you're there for someone is
the best thing you can do.
- I think that's the best.
Like I didn't even realize
I needed a phone call
but like for Ginger to
up and call me I didn't
even think I needed it, you know.
It was sweet of her and I
appreciate it, we didn't talk
much, half the time it was
silence like "oh you doing okay?"
yeah, mm, mm, it was nice of her though.
- It was nice, thanks Ginger.
Matt called me and my brother
Nate called me while you
were in the operating room and just--
- I texted my sisters a bajillion times.
- Just knowing that you're
there for someone means
a lot to that person.
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna drown ourselves
in apples and caramel.
So this is where we're
gonna end it tonight,
the boys are doing good,
they're in bed asleep.
- They put themselves to bed tonight.
- Which thank goodness!
As you can tell this has been
very difficult and there's
more levels to it than
just what's on the surface
and I think that's difficult,
but I think one of the coolest
things, coolest things, what am I saying?
One of the neatest things
if there is something
neat out of this experience
that we're going through
is that the weirdest
part about what we do.
When we've gone through your
comments, it's been so nice
and almost hopeful for us
to see that so many people
have been helped through this situation.
There's one comment in
particular that I'm thinking of,
there are these sisters
who both had miscarriages
and they haven't talked about
it with each other and just
seeing the way that we
went through this and then
we've vlogged about it and
talked about it has encouraged
these two sisters to talk
to each other about it
and it's helped them go through
their experience together.
And so just like, it sucks for
us to go through but knowing
that some people can
benefit from us sharing our
experience I think helps
us go through it too.
So if there is any light to
this I hope that's part of it.
So thank you for sharing
your story with us to thank
you for being there, we so appreciate it.
We're gonna say goodnight,
I hope you guys have a good
week and we'll see you tomorrow, bye.
