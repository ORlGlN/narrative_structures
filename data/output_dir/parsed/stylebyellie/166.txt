(bright music)
- You about ready?
- I am ready.
Let's do this.
- Good morning, I hope you
brought your learning hat,
because we're gonna get
some learning on today.
- Good.
I hope so.
- As if puzzles weren't
hard enough already,
I decided to throw another
challenge into the mix.
This puzzle that I got,
it's like reflecting.
So it's kind of like weird,
it has a weird effect to it,
I don't know if the
camera's picking it up.
But that's what I'm
putting together today.
I saw this at the store the other day,
and thought, this captures
my emotions perfectly.
I'm gonna get it, and I'm
gonna put it together.
And it's gonna be a challenge, but fun.
(applause)
- And in real life, he
brings so much energy
so come fully prepared to learn.
Completely open mind,
whatever he's talking about,
it will relate back to your business
that you're building,
so just keep that in mind seriously.
-  And then you can start
branching out from there,
and then your CPM's can get less views,
and make more money that way.
- He's in trouble.
- Hi Jared.
- We love you and your
family and your kids.
(bell dings)
- And I really miss Ellie.
- You went to the bathroom
(bell dings)
and so we took your camera.
And we just wanted to tell you
that we really miss you already,
'cause you just went to the bathroom.
- But I really miss Ellie.
(bell dings)
and everybody else.
- That's right and don't fall
asleep while you're editing.
(bell dings)
- So one of the main events today
is a keynote speech by Gary V.
And he's about to come out.
Shonduras is giving him
an introduction right now.
And I think everyone's
gonna be going crazy.
- Gary V, guys.
(applause and cheering)
Gary, welcome to the stage.
-  This puzzle
should have come with Advil.
Look at the pieces, every
time I look for a piece,
they all move (laughs).
- Ladies and gentlemen,
here is Bryan Lanning
in front of a green screen.
You can put whatever you
want behind him right now.
Download this footage.
Put him underwater, put him on the moon,
it's up to you.
Put him on stage, oh not
in the dungeon, oh no.
- Which one does this one?
- That's a hard one, huh?
I'm having a hard time.
- Yeah.
- You know?
- Yeah, can I watch YouTube?
- Can you put together
my puzzle using that?
- This?
- Mmm-mmm, just put it together,
push a button and it'll put it together?
It's not working.
- Huh?
- It's not working.
- Why is it not working?
- I don't know.
Maybe it just works for the TV.
- Okay, so I had lunch in the same room,
I didn't have lunch with him, with Gary V,
who just did the keynote, right?
- He was pretty awesome.
- It was pretty great, yeah.
But so I went and got a picture with him,
the picture's right here,
and then we shook hands.
And I want to tell you
about when we shook hands.
Don't laugh, it's serious business.
- What happened, Jared what happened?
- Did you hold him for too long?
-  No.
- Were your hands sweaty?
- No, it was the most magical handshake
I've ever had.
-  What?
- And I'll tell you exactly why.
So I reached out my hand like this,
and when we shook hands,
the crease in my hand right there,
and his crease just met up perfectly
and our hands clasped at the same time,
and everything was just
like in the perfect sync.
-  Are you in love?
- Well I was in love with that handshake.
It was the best handshake I've
- The best handshake you've ever had.
- Absolutely, without
even thinking about it.
- Not like number two or number three.
That's a big deal Jared,
that's a really big deal.
- I'm so glad you're documenting this,
because you might forget.
- No it was a good handshake.
There's some important
thinks about a handshake.
And like, so it wasn't like
a Donald Trump handshake.
You know like the
- Yeah yeah.
- Yeah it wasn't like that.
-  Yeah, the choo choo train.
- Yeah exactly, the choo choo train.
- The choo choo train.
- Yeah, it was like a nice fit,
a firm squeeze and a
- It's like slipping
your hand into a glove.
- It's like a gentleman's handshake.
-  Exactly, yeah exactly.
This guy behind us is
like what in the heck
are you guys talking about.
(laughing)
- The best thing in the world
is ordering food so it comes to your door,
and sitting and watching movies all day
and that's just what I've been doing.
Worked on my puzzle, my
friend here, hi Whitney.
And all of our kids are outside playing.
And I love that Penny is just so happy
that everyone's out there.
Like she's just laying
and chewing on her bone.
But food is gonna be here soon,
I'm gonna stop talking,
'cause it's annoying to listen
to someone talk like this,
and I don't want to talk
when I sound like this,
so we're just gonna eat food
and enjoy the rest of our day.
(chill funky music)
(airplane rumbling)
- We're done with our
classes at VidSummit today
and we're out to dinner.
We've got the whole crew here.
I'm hanging out with my dad.
Of course, I'm hanging out with my dad.
But we've got the whole crew,
Corbin, Carl, Jinger, Missy came to town.
- Hi.
- And Bryan,
and honestly, we're at the steakhouse
and I feel a little awkward filming here,
because it's like a nice place.
- And I'm gonna eat a whole one.
- I was just about to say maybe I feel
a little bit less awkward now.
(laughing)
Thanks for always making
me feel comfortable
in these situations.
This is the strangest
bacon I've ever seen,
but it's the most amazing
bacon I've ever seen.
-  Amazing.
-  Look how thick that bacon is,
it's a half a fork thick.
-  And it comes in a maple glaze.
It's incredible.
-  It is so good.
Dinner is served.
Holy cow Dad.
How much of the cow did you want?
- No kidding, I think
that's at least half of it.
(laughing)
- Are you ready for this Dad?
- I don't know.
- Do you think you can handle the course?
-  I don't know.
- They're going pretty quick.
It's like a slick track,
they're like sliding all over the place.
This is sweet.
I hope we get to race.
There's a lot of people,
so we may not get an opportunity
to race on the track,
because of all the people here,
but I'm crossing our fingers for us.
Is my hair okay?
-  Good luck buddy.
(chill funky music)
(race cars sliding)
(skid squealing)
- So bad, I felt so bad,
but that was crazy, fun.
Did it look cool?
- It was awesome.
- Okay, you're up next, man.
Come on Mario Karts.
Woo, oh.
(Jared laughs)
(skid squealing)
(race cars motoring)
So Jinger has been talking smack all day
about how she is going to
crush everyone at racing today.
And let's just say, I'm not
sure that's gonna happen.
(laughing)
Corbin comin' out of nowhere,
pressuring, pressuring Carl.
Alright, the results are in.
- Are they?
-  Yes, who do you think one?
- I don't know.
- Not me.
- Yes!
- No no!
- Wait, he's joking.
-  Corbin!
- Yeah!
- I was like, no way.
-  It was really
close Carl, you got second.
- Right at the end.
- Yeah, how was it man?
- It was amazing.
I felt good, like nobody passed me
and I was pushing the limits.
- You were in first place
for like half the race.
- Did you have a lot of fun?
- I had an amazing time,
this was so awesome.
- That's good to hear.
- Yes sir.
- I had a really great time.
- Make sure to slam on
some strike balm guys.
- Slammo!
- I'm not sure what to do with my hands.
- We're gonna get a big
group picture over here.
- Alright scrunch in,
like we're all gonna fit
right here, load it up.
(chill funky music)
- Oh Jinger, what
What place did you get?
- Oh third, but what was your time Jared,
I'm really interested.
- 31.1.
- Oh really?
31.3.
- Ooh.
- That really hurts my ego.
- Sorry about that.
- Rematch coming right up.
- Alright, you name the
place, you name the time,
I'll be there.
- Oh oh.
- I'll beat you fair.
- And square.
- What?
- What a day, what a day indeed.
