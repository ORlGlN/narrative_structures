(quirky electronic music)
- Good morning.
After our massages last night,
Jared woke up and he said his back
feels like a big bruise.
- I seriously got beat up.
Like I got beat up.
And I'm afraid to take off my shirt,
because I feel like I'm gonna be bruised.
Should we check?
-  Yes.
Your neck looks red.
- It's so tender, ow, careful.
(laughs)
Her thumbs are so sharp, like all--
-  Your neck is red, though.
- All of this right
here is tender to touch.
-  Aww.
- We are on day two of our trip to China.
We just finished up in Guangzhou
and now we're driving
in this tiny little bus.
Hi.
- It's huge.
- It's huge.
(laughing)
- Well when you think of
a big yellow school bus.
- We're just all riding
on the short bus, Jared,
there's nothing round about it.
- Anyway, we're going to Dongguan?
- Dongguan.
- Dongguan.
And it's Friday, no it's Saturday.
Oh my gosh, my days are all messed up.
So it's Saturday.
And we're having some fun today.
So we've got about a two hour bus drive,
because the traffic is pretty intense.
It's crazy to see the differences
about how everyone travels
and even just the scenery outside.
It's pretty cool, it's
pretty amazing to see.
(bright music)
- I have got
- Wait wait, we have sticks.
- Oh my gosh.
- The Ikea jelly cookies,
which are to die for.
- Oh there you go.
-  Those are good.
I have some Kind bars.
-  Okay.
- And a pack of Hot Tamales.
- Okay hold on.
I've got some Skittles.
I've got a couple Clif bars
and a Sunbelt Bakery
chocolate chip granola bar.
- I traded that last time.
- Yeah, oh that's right, I do remember.
Oh and then a Builder's
Protein bar from Clif.
- We just gave you a Ferrero Rocher.
- A what?
- Ferrero Rocher, we did just--
- I just gave her.
- Yeah, she gave it to her.
- No that was in kind,
that was given in kind.
-  That was to initiate the, okay.
- Out of the goodness of my heart.
- Of my heart.
- Maybe then just make it even
and take the Clif bar.
- I'm okay.
- Rejected the trade.
Okay, we're done here.
We're done here.
- Dangit!
-  No Jared!
- I'm not taking any of that.
(bright lively music)
Oh my gosh, look at that Ellie.
This looks so cool.
- We are ready for some lunch.
(bright music)
Jackson, it's a pinchy crab.
-  It's a pinchy crab.
- I'm a pinchy crab.
We're eating lunch with
our group of friends
and our friends that we actually just met.
Our friends Jase and T are
good friends with them,
but Bonnie and I and our
spouses just met them today.
So everyone's ordering lunch,
because we obviously
don't know what to order
and they are experts.
So we are having a very
good Chinese lunch.
And we just learned a
few good etiquette things
that you should do in China.
- Yep, in terms of the culture, we're--
- We're all cringing a little.
- Yeah.
- So we just learned a few things,
but nobody's gonna eat
until the leader eats first.
- Hopefully we don't screw it up
even more than we already have.
- No we have a little bit,
but I think things are good.
They're all talking and
figuring lunch out, so.
- They just came around
and poured hot water
in our glasses and we're trying to decide
if that's for us to drink,
or to clean our dishes with.
And I think it's for us to drink.
-  Yeah.
- Is this the one we're supposed to drink?
- Yeah, this is totally drinkable.
-  He was saying
how they don't drink cold.
- Yeah well, they don't drink cold,
because from the tap, it's
not good drinking water.
They always boil their water.
- Yeah, so you usually
drink hot water here.
- So they're used to
drinking hot water, yeah.
- Thank you for bringing us in,
thank you so much for lunch.
We appreciate it.
(speaking in foreign language)
(speaking in foreign language)
- Yeah, he said it's a normal thing,
but thank you.
- No, thank you.
- We're very grateful.
- This is chicken feet.
Matt, I'm doing this because
you had chicken feet soup.
I'm eating chicken feet.
(Ellie laughing)
-  So funny.
- We're in this marketplace
and we're just--
- Don't you see?
All the certified Motorola's,
they come and get every
individual little piece for it.
- And they just build phones
and make 'em right here on the spot.
- Yeah, I'll take you to that spot.
- That's so cool.
Like anything, anything over here,
all these tiny little parts everywhere.
Look at all that.
And that is totally
not a real Apple store.
That is a (laughs)
-  Well yeah, no.
-  Yeah, that is
such a fake Apple store,
that's so funny.
- Well you know how it's a fake one?
'Cause there's another one right there.
- 'Cause there's another one right there.
- Oh wait, there's
another one right there.
- What the heck, this is so funny.
Everyone hit it ready?
♫ Go up
♫ And they stay there
♫ And they stay there
♫ And they stay there
♫ Up down up down up down
♫ 'Cause all I do is win
♫ Ludacris goin' down on the verse
♫ 'Cause I never been
defeated and I won't stop now
♫ Hold it up
♫ For the homies that didn't make it
♫ And the folks locked down
Hey!
(Jared laughing)
- We are now on Instagram.
We are worldwide famous now.
- Yeah, woo!
- You were cute.
- I like you.
Jared and I are just sitting down,
waiting for everybody to
come out of the building.
Everyone's kinda shopping
and this is where we're at.
It's just fun to watch and see how people
do things here, you know?
- To watch life work here is--
- In another part of the world.
- Yeah, it's so
I guess like educational is the best word.
Like it's cool to experience a culture
that's completely different
than what you're used to.
- Yeah.
- I like it a lot.
- What's the thing that
has surprised you the most?
- Probably how much smoking there is.
Like everyone smokes
and there's a lot of it.
- Yeah.
- It's interesting walking into a place
and people see your blond hair
and everyone's looking.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, someone asked
me if I was from Russia.
- Yeah.
- They thought you were Russian,
- Yeah.
- which was funny.
I love it,
it's a new experience
and I want to do things like this more.
- Yeah.
- We were dancing in that music store
and apparently it's on
their social media network
and it's being shared around right now.
- Oh my god,
- Oh my gosh.
-  What the heck?
- I looked over there.
-  No there was
like six people filming us.
- When we was dancing, there was a crowd.
At least three or four people filming.
-  That's hilarious.
- Well my internet connection's
not very good right now.
- That's okay, that's funny, though.
-  That is so funny.
- On WiFi we'll be able to look at it.
- So we're like Chinese
celebrities right now.
- (laughs) No.
- We're not Chinese, but
we're celebrities in China.
- The word for that in
Chinese is (speaking Chinese).
It means you've almost made
it, that everyone knows you,
but you're not quite there.
-  Not quite there.
(speaking in Chinese)
- That's so funny.
- That's funny.
-  This is your key to
happiness and also the metro.
- Single ticket.
- Oh, you already have one?
Who gave you one?
- Sneaky sneaky.
(bright electronic music)
- We're walking around downtown,
looking for a place to eat.
There was a Burger King (laughs)
that everyone wanted to go to.
I think it sounds kinda funny,
go to a Burger King while you're in China.
But they tore it down,
things change so fast here.
They said that Shenzhen five years ago,
nothing like this was here
and everything has changed
within the last five years.
And it's like this booming metropolis,
everyone's like high fashion over here,
just a little bit different
than what it was five years ago.
- This is so cool!
- Alright.
- It's time to get your exercise on.
- Woo!
-  You guys ready to work out?
- And it's line music,
I've been waiting to hear this.
-  Oh here you go.
(lively electronic music)
Get it, get it, get it, get it.
(singing in Chinese)
This is epic.
This is really good.
It is really good.
(Ellie laughing)
-  This is fun.
-  So you see
the people in the white
and the blue there?
- Yeah.
-  They're the ones
who are like leading it.
-  I love it.
Jase and T brought us
to one of their clients.
And this is Helen.
Hi Helen.
Hi.
- Oh hi.
-  She is drawing.
-  This is my suit.
-  Jared's suit.
And she had the boys pick out fabric.
- This is the fabric that I picked out.
So it's like a nice gray,
but it also has some texture to it.
-  Yes.
- Woops, sorry Helen, I
didn't see that was your arm.
-  And you, Joel and
Jase are gonna be getting suits.
- Matching?
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, matching?
- I get really loud,
like I get gray with orange plaid.
Or gray with pink plaid.
- Like this?
- Gold?
- You know what, that's like anaconda.
(whimsical playful music)
- Stop staring at Jared.
(Ellie laughing)
I swear, we don't even
capture the funny moments.
- Ahhh.
Oh Susannah.
-  The ladies
just out here chattin'.
- Yep.
- Yes.
-  Are we all like dead?
- We're so dead.
We're so tired.
-  I feel like I
haven't been peppy, but,
- I know.
It's kinda hard to be when you're tired.
(laughs)
And we're only on day three.
- We have had fun,
- it's just the end of the night.
- It's go go go time.
- She did it.
- Yeah.
- President Bush's jacket.
Same person who just measured me,
got all up in here, made
one for President Bush.
George W.
- But there was no exchanging of stones.
- That is a private experience,
when we had our massage yesterday.
Do I even say it?
-  Yeah, tell 'em.
- Okay, what happened yesterday
was probably the most invasive
thing of my entire life.
It was crazy.
- Oh man.
- So we had these hot stones
and they put 'em on
our back and everything
and I kid you not, I kid you not,
- I have to walk away.
- The lady--
- Took my bum cheeks, pulled them open,
took the hot stone and put it in,
put it in my bum crack
and then closed my bum cheeks over it.
-  And were you like uh-oh.
- I went (gasps),
ah, oh.
-  And then she took it out.
- And then she took it out.
I kid you not.
And there was one point in time,
because she had multiple stones
so she did that one time,
and I'm not sure sure if
she used it as a place
to like, I'm just gonna
put the stones here
so they have a place to go.
- No.
- Oh my gosh.
- She did two, she opened it up
and put two stones in there, closed it up.
-  That's the weirdest.
- It was crazy.
Hi Helen.
- Hello, hi.
- Helen, this is my wife Natalie.
(speaking in Chinese)
- Nice to meet you.
-  Nice to meet you.
- Also, I don't even know
if we've introduced Natalie.
Hi guys.
- We haven't done proper
introductions of anyone.
So we've got, everyone but
Should we do introductions right now?
-  Hurry, yeah.
- So I want to introduce
you to Natalie and Richie.
-  Hi.
- We're super sweaty, we just ran
- It's okay.
- All through streets.
- It's Chinese sweat though,
so it's good for you.
-  Natalie is so so sweet.
- Aww.
- And Richie is so so--
- Not.
(laughing)
- Hey it is funny, you
guys really are opposites.
Like you're sweet and positivity,
and he's kinda harsh.
- It's sweet and sour,
just like dipping sauce
for Chinese food, know what I'm saying?
Know what I'm sayin'?
- Totally.
- You guys are so funny.
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- They live in Hawaii.
And do you guys have a vlog?
- We do, it's called Rukuslist,
just like it sounds, Rukuslist.
And we just started a couple months ago,
but we make cool stuff.
-  You do,
- We make cool stuff.
- Especially Natalie's Instagram.
-  Yeah, I'm the winner.
- Everything he said
- Ellie is like
- I move back to her.
(laughing)
But he's really fun too.
- Pro Natalie, Ellie's like
oh I'm all about Natalie.
- Pro Natalie, anti Richie.
- We love him.
- We like you.
He's been making me laugh
all night with his jokes.
He's kind of harsh.
- Then we have Rachel and Jase
from the Ohana Adventure.
- Hi.
- Aloha, I mean hello.
-  Hello.
- Yeah, we've all just been hanging out.
-  And T.
- and then TFN, who's doing
a four by four Rubik's Cube right now.
(laughing)
And why not, right?
- Random random.
- We've been with him all day,
he hasn't had this, and he just walked
abour the corner with it.
So why not?
- Why not?
- Where did you pick that up?
- I'm very intrigued.
-  I just went and asked Coco for it.
- Oh yeah, Coco.
- He knows somebody here named Coco,
who has a four by four Rubik's cube.
And we want to introduce Ellie
who is here.
(laughing)
- She's Ellie from Ellie and Jared.
- Yeah, do you know it was
going to be Jared and Ellie.
-  Oh.
- It was going to be Jared and Ellie.
- But you went alphabetical.
-  That's exactly
right, how did you know?
- 'Cause I feel like that's logical.
- It is logical, and we
actually did that because,
-  Because I'm
a marriage counselor.
(laughing)
- It kinda feels like in the bus
that we've all been having these talks,
it's like we get down and deep
and we're talking about all these things,
and everyone's crying and everything,
having a good experience
and it's just been a lot of fun.
And now we're making suits with Helen, so.
- Did you see that she made
one for President Bush?
- For President Bush, yeah,
we were talking about that.
-  It is pretty cool.
-  I want that.
-  This is
very important, this one.
- How much is that?
-  180.
(singing in Chinese)
- Your turn.
You can sing.
- I don't sing.
- You don't sing?
- I don't sing too.
- Sing the same one.
-  If you sing it, we'll buy it.
(singing in Chinese)
(cheering and clapping)
Everybody give it up for
- Lisa.
- Lisa yay.
(clapping)
-  Lisa yay.
- Longtime singer, first
time in our audience.
♫ Smelly cats, smelly cats
- Bonnie and Joel are buying one of these.
So it'll be worth it.
- It depends on how much
we can bargain him down.
♫ Sorry no sorry
-  Hi Calvin.
- Hi.
-  Hi buddy.
- I Mommy bed.
-  You slept in Mommy's bed?
- Yeah.
-  Oh you silly.
- Do you know what I did on my bed?
I slept the whole time.
-  Yay Jackson, you slept
the whole time in your bed?
-  Yeah.
- Good.
- Calvin.
- Nope.
-  Calvin.
-  Okay, I love you so much
and I want to give you a
hug through the phone, okay?
Family hug, ready?
Oh hug hug hug hug, I love you so much.
(Jared laughs)
I love you boys.
