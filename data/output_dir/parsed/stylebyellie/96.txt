We're gonna set up our tree.
- Yay!
- Yes!
- What about the ornaments and the hooks?
-  Yep, we'll get the hooks
and the ornaments out for you guys
to decorate this tree. Turn on that light.
- Aw..
-  You want more?
- Yeah.
-  I feel like
that's all you ever ask.
Let's set this tree up, okay?
- Tree?
-  Yeah.
- I want that still on. Forever.
-  The camera?
Oh! Should we film us setting it up?
(baby talk)
-  You want to set up the tree?
- Yeah, tree.
- Tree, my tree.
- Hello.
- Heeellllooo.
-  Hi.
Hi.
(giggles)
- Hiiii!
-  You guys ready?
- Yup! We're ready.
- Are these the ornaments?
- Yeah, those are candy cane ornaments.
- I love candy cane ornaments!
(joyful Christmas music)
- Oh! It's so pretty!
- Yeah!
- It's your tree?
- It's my tree too!
- Yeah!
- So, do we still like the name Mason?
- Yeah.
- It is a... cupcake!
- Maybe right here.
- That looks so good.
This is so fun.
- Yeah, I know.
- I just have been too tired to do it,
but I'm glad that we're doing it now.
- Yeah.
- You've been so good.
- Me?
- Yes you have been a good boy
You know that momma's been sick, huh?
- Yeah, I know.
-  I'm so sorry.
- You're so sorry, come
here, give me a hug.
You are so cute to me!
(joyful Christmas music)
- Look! Mine looks like a Christmas tree.
- I have been a flip-flopper
this Christmas season
whether to decorate the
Christmas tree or not.
And most of it has been
because I've been too tired
with my pregnancy, I'm
either with the kids
for a little bit of the
day or I'm laying down
and I just didn't know if
I had it in me to do it.
But this morning I did
and I'm glad that I did
because it's beautiful.
The kids decorated their tree
downstairs and they loved it.
They loved it!
And it was so fun seeing them do it.
They're watching a movie and
I'm decorating the tree up here.
And right now I have all of the filler in,
so there's little flocked
ones, there's little berries
and then there's like silver
berries all over the tree.
And just having just that done,
I feel like has made it so pretty.
Like, I would be happy
even if it was just that
but I'm gonna continue,
I'm gonna do the ornaments.
I put my little deer up there,
so we're gettin' things going.
This is a cute thing, Emily made
this for me years ago for Christmas.
Got those in there,
and this is what we got
from our Redditgift, I believe
it was Reddit last year.
Today we announced that baby is a boy
on social media and all
of you guys are loving
the name Mason and it
just, like, tickles me
I'm so excited that everyone likes that.
Naming babies is interesting because
I brought up that name a
little bit with Calvin,
but Jared and I were both were like,
"No, it doesn't fit."
It was so weird how like it
just didn't fit and Calvin did.
And how this time around it's like
Mason's settling really well with me.
We just started talking
about names so we're
probably going to come
up with a lot more names
and kind of decide and feel it out.
And, Jared's mom just texted me, she like,
"I love the name Mason"
and I'm like, "eyyyy".
More points for Mason.
Jared isn't a huge fan yet, I don't know
if he doesn't like it we'll
think of some more names, but..
It's just fun, it's been fun
seeing you guys' reaction
thanks for being so happy for us!
I have just, I go to bed
late and I just think
about him and I've been
looking at baby boy blankets
and I'm thinking like,
what kind of blanket I
want him to have and picking out the baby
blankets was like really
special for me when
I picked out Jackson's and Calvin's
and they still have their baby blankets.
They use them every single night.
They are so small now, they're definitely
in need of a bigger one
and I just, it's fun.
Life is really, really special, it's crazy
how just a few months ago life was like
shattered and it was like,
"This is insane, I don't know
if we can do this again."
And now, like life is really good and I'm
very, very grateful for
that, and I'm having
a lot of fun decorating my tree.
(exhales)
I need Jared to help me with the top.
We're both very short
people so it's really
hard decorating the top of the tree.
Penny! That's not your
ball. That's not your ball.
Go put it on the tree, oh Penny!
No, no, no. Okay, drop.
She's like, "why can't I have it?"
No. It's not yours, come here.
Let's get you a toy.
-  Penny if you're
going to grab an ornament
you have to put it on the
tree, that's the rule.
That's the rule, that's the rule, okay?
Please cue the Final
Fantasy 7 Victory Fanfare.
(Fanfare plays)
Ellie, Tell them what we've done.
- We decorated the tree.
-  Yes! It's finally done.
Look how pretty it is, I don't
know what we were thinking.
- I don't know, but
I'm glad that I did it.
Like, these ornaments are so cute.
-  They are very, very pretty
- And all the filler is
just fluffy, and fun.
- You know you don't have
a Christmas tree unless
it's got some fluffy filler, you know?
- We have lots of fluff.
- Fluffy filler, all about.
Now that that is done, check.
Important things off our list.
Next we have to finish off our deliveries.
We've got some fun deliveries
that we have to make
we have to go to ship some
stuff out, ship my pants!
Of course I'm gonna ship my pants.
I just shipped my bed!
- What commercial was that?
-  Kmart.
- That was like the best
commercial of the year.
-  It really was.
- I think companies, it's like
come on, have fun with it.
Make your customers
laugh, that was hilarious.
It is a week until Christmas
and we are doing our
big major Christmas shopping right now
at the grocery store, I have a list
for Jared, a list for me, I'll get a cart,
you get a cart and each
kid will get a cart.
- Now, are we, I'm just
looking at this list here
and I just have a
question, are we allowed to
make any changes to anything
that's on this list?
-  As long as it's adding
to it and not taking away.
- For example, taking
away black beans, vinegar,
-  No, I need that
- Cloves, nutmeg,
-  No, no, I want that.
- Adding like, Dr. Pepper and cereal..
-  No, you can add
to it, don't take away
- Don't take away
-  Don't take away.
- I can add whatever I want,
so they have like, Traegers in here..
-  No, I mean, okay
I'll have the shopping list
and you get the cart, we
need two carts because
we need to get lots of toilet paper.
- I can do that.
-  Yep, he knows just what to do.
He's gonna help us, like, he really is.
Calvin opted for the motor vehicle cart
and that is what we're
rolling with right now.
Oh, get it, rolling with?
(Christmas music)
Whee!
- Follow the leader, follow the leader.
Marco..
-  Polo..
-  I think mom is
close. Let's go find her.
- Ah! Found you!
- Found you!
-  Wow, you are so
much more efficient than I am.
Look at your cart!
- We have a wild one!
-  Well, we did
have to take a potty break.
- Oh, you did?
- I'm gonna pass them
onto you while I catch up
and try to make up for lost time.
- That's okay, do you
want to help me, Jacks?
No, that's right, yep that's
left. So go and turn left.
You got candy canes, you
got the ice cream and treats
got toilet paper, drinks,
cleaner, tons of food
down there, crackers...
I needed Jared to come with me today
usually I go with the kids, but I needed
Jared to come because I
knew we would do two carts.
Because, it's like,
everything, we don't want to
have to go into town on
the 26th of December.
We want everything.
(Christmas music)
- Did you laugh when I yelled out,
"Excuse me sir, you're taking too long"?
Well I think you were the only
one who wasn't thinking that.
I think everyone was
like, "What the heck?".
I mean, look at the size of this receipt!
-  It is a nice car. That's funny.
- Growing up in my family
we definitely had our
favorite Christmas movies that we would
watch like, on repeat.
One of them was "A Muppet
Christmas Carol" that
is a must in the Mecham House.
The other one was "It's a Wonderful Life",
don't you shake your head at that Ellie!
"A Muppet Christmas Carol" is a classic!
- Because both of those movies
I never watched growing up.
-  Oh my gosh.
- I need to watch "White Christmas".
-  "It's a Wonderful Life"?
- Yes, I need to watch that.
- Yeah, "It's a Wonderful Life",
"A Muppet Christmas Carol"
and, "The Santa Clause".
And we are going to watch
"The Santa Clause" tonight.
The first time you boys have ever seen it
and it's going to be a
family tradition for you,
henceforth, forever.
That and "A Muppet Christmas Carol", okay?
You guys having fun with your candy canes?
- I'm playing with mine.
-  Oh yeah, we got
popcorn popping upstairs
we're having a family
Christmas movie night!
- Lately I haven't been loving sweets,
like especially chocolate
and stuff, which is
a real sad thing because I love that.
But, Bonnie had that
candy at her house and
I ate a few and I was like,
"This tastes so good."
So, peanut M&M's are
really good and they're
ones that I haven't had
for a while, because
M&M keeps coming out
with like caramel ones
and pretzel ones and all sorts of new ones
that we have been trying
but it's been forever
since I had just a peanut
M&M, so those are good.
That, and oranges, these
little mini oranges.
P.S. we did not name
Calvin after Scott Calvin
on "The Santa Clause"
Calvin's name is Calvin Scott,
and we didn't even put
the two and two together,
is that not funny?
- I totally did and I named
Calvin for that reason.
- And his name's Charlie..
- I told you Ellie,
- What?
- I've got this all planned out.
- Jackson came up with Charlie.
- Who do you think gave him the idea?
- We got the kids into bed and now is the
time that Ellie and I
are beginning going over
the IVF grants and the applications
- I got my pen.
- You got your pen.
- It's a sperm and an egg, ah,
the sperm got stuck, there we go.
- This is an exciting
time and it's kind of a
nerve wracking time and
I want you guys to know
that Ellie and I don't take this lightly,
we feel like you are
sharing your very personal
story with us, and we are taking this and
we're trying to make the
best of it that we can.
- We have a sheet of paper
for each and every one
of you, just like we did last year.
- That's not even everyone,
this is just the first batch.
- We still have last years all together.
- I'm just excited to get to know each
and every one of you
applied more and to hear
your story and to connect with you because
It's something amazing when you share this
connection, it's just real and personal.
Last clip our battery
died, so sorry about that,
but it's just after 1 A.M.
so Ellie and I are going
to call it quits for the night.
Thank you so much for
watching guys, if you enjoyed
the video give it a big thumbs up,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye.
