(uptempo fiddle music)
-  Bingo!
(elegant jazzy music)
-  Every time we
come to Andy's playroom,
Jackson builds a jump.
Okay, let's see.
-  Whoa.
-  A little tall.
Woo, good job.
- Whoa.
- Good job.
-  Are you ready
to meet Dr. Strange?
Yeah?
Are you ready to meet Dr. Strange?
- Yes.
(laughing)
- It is sea day, so we are traveling
amongst the sea.
It's beautiful outside today.
One thing, I had no idea what to expect
was seeing like animal life on the cruise,
whether it was dolphins or whales.
We haven't seen anything,
and when we had dinner, our private dinner
up on the very very top,
the guy said, I've been
doing this for eight years
and I think I've only seen dolphins
three or four times.
And so I was like oh man,
I was kinda hoping we'd
see some more animals,
but I always keep my eye out and look,
just in case.
(playful piano music)
Jackson is at a club.
That's the coolest thing.
He just loves going there.
And he can go in there, scan his badge
and he just stays there
and plays until we go
and pick him up.
So we have, the three of us,
we're having a little snack
before we do something amazing.
That's right, B-I-N-G-O.
- Bingo.
- We're playing Bingo.
(playful music)
-  Bingo!
-  Jared is close guys.
- I'm super close.
-  Was that joke
suppose to break the ice?
-  He can taste it.
Wa wa wa.
- Wa wa, I was two away
before the person won.
(signal tone)
- We have pretty much stuck
with the kids' schedules
that they have at home.
They've actually slept
in quite a bit here.
They go to bed like an hour,
an hour and a half later than normal.
And we all take a nap in the day.
Today they didn't get a nap.
They will be up late.
This is the first day
that it's been like an all day thing.
Fun dance party, they are
off to the sitter's though
and Jared and I are going
to do something spectacular.
(yelling)
(bright music)
- We're going on a ride.
Woo!
This is beautiful!
Woo!
- Woo!
(signal tone)
