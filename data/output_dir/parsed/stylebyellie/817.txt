good morning guys I woke up pretty early
this morning to feed Kelvin and I
decided I don't think I'm going to lay
back in bed for an hour I'm just going
to get up and get ready before everyone
else that way I could kind of get an
early start to my day so I have a bunch
of chicken scratch right here and I am
just getting my grocery list ready for
the week hopefully I'll probably end up
going one more time before Christmas but
I'm just getting my grocery list done
we're going to go grocery shopping or
gonna get a bunch of errands done today
and it feels really peaceful it feels
really good to be awake before everybody
else and ready and just sit and kind of
just think because I don't really feel
like I get that much at nighttime and
but it feels really good to have that
right now so yay for getting chicken
enchiladas and beef stew ready for the
week
