- Holy crap, my heart is
pumping out of my chest.
- Oh my gosh, guys, we only
have three months left.
- I cannot believe this
is happening right now.
I'm not used to seeing
your body like this.
-  (laughs)
- Got your butt!
- Ow, my arm! (groans)
- Ha, I won!
- Jackson thinks just because
he got a new pair of pants
that is a size five,
that he can now beat Mom.
I'm still in charge of you.
Let's see 'em, turn around.
He just got a new pair of
pants 'cause all of his
pants he has outgrown,
and I bet here in like
two or three weeks, they'll
fit him even better.
I just at the beginning of
winter, I bought Jackson
some pants and they didn't fit,
and I was gonna return them.
Two weeks later, they all
of the sudden fit him,
and then the other day, he
came upstairs with those
same pants on, I was like, "Are
you wearing Calvin's pants?"
'Cause they're just one size apart,
and he totally needed some
more pants, that's crazy.
- You dare fight my wife, huh?
-  (chuckles) You're smiling now,
but now when Dad gets mad. (laughs)
Ahh!
- I have something to tell you!
A secret!
I'm not left-handed!
Hwah, haa!
Name that movie!
Isn't it crazy that it
just seemed like yesterday.
Why is my sword floppy? (Ellie laughs)
It just seems like yesterday
that we were praying
and going to doctors to
have this little Jackson,
and now he's in size five...
Pants!
(grunting)
- Ah! His leg. (chuckling)
You are the champion, my friend.
Put your arms up, look nice and proud!
Say, "I'm the winner!"
- Yeah!
(Jared grunts)
(Ellie yelps)
(Jared and Ellie laugh)
-  I meant to get his stomach!
-  Hey, shucks! (laughs)
He gotcha good!
(laughing) Right in the crotch.
We're trying to see who woke who up.
It was Jackson.
-  It looks like Calvin.
-  Last night at
like, yeah, 3:37, we both
woke up to giggling, and
laughing, and screaming.
And they were laughing, and
what did we do, Jackson?
- I wanna watch (mumbling).
-  Jackson, what did
Dad do when you were laughing?
- Did I tell you to go back to bed?
Yeah, I did.
-  Tell me what he said.
Did he go, "Go back to bed!"
- Dad cried me.
-  Then you cried.
What did he say?
- Dad cried me.
- (laughing) Jackson cried.
'Cause Jared was like,
"I'm not doing this,
"it's 3:00 in the morning."
But it was really funny that
they both woke up laughing.
Lincoln, you are one different toddler.
He talks so good. (laughing)
And he's just curious.
- I want water, I'm gonna go downstairs.
- Bye, Linc!
I have never had a spray
tan, but when I woke up
this morning I was like,
(gasps) "It's beautiful!"
Like, I just feel fresh for spring.
Did you love it?
- Oh, I'm so brown and
perfect, and I love it.
I wish I had my makeup on!
- I woke up and felt like,
"Okay, I'm glad that I did that."
Not a regret there.
- No, not at all.
I love it, because it's like in the--
(Ellie and Bonnie laugh)
- Jared likes my body.
- (laughing) I do.
I think you're so beautiful.
Okay, so here's the thing.
I would've loved you no matter what,
with or without the spray tan.
I think that's like something
I have to make clear,
like we'll do a little
asterisk, like no matter what.
Wait! Wait!
But seeing you tan like
this in the middle of March
is like, I'm not used to
seeing your body like this.
I like it a lot.
-  Yes!
- (laughs)
We've been filming all morning,
but we are sitting down,
and we are choosing eight
winners for our Bollie bag!
- Our giveaway, we're
choosing our winners!
- Yes, so we are going through emails,

-  Good job!
- Thanks, Ellie.
- This is so fun.
- I cannot believe this
is happening right now.
I think this is the only time that
I've ever seen Instagram go down.
- Down.
- And it's right when we're
doing an Instagram giveaway.
Like, Instagram, what is going on?
I hope this doesn't have
to do with like the whole
Facebook, Russia, like all of that stuff.
Or leaking information, I don't know
what the whole Facebook thing is.
- I'm out of the loop.
- I was gonna say I
have no idea. (chuckles)
- (laughs) Current events, ladies.
(Jared and Bonnie laugh)
So, um, maybe we're
gonna take a little break
from this until Instagram
gets their servers back up,
because we can't load a darn
thing on Instagram right now.
- Those are cute.
- Aren't those cute?
- Oh, they're already
off doing something else.
Squirrel!
- Jackson just said, "Why
were you gone so long?"
I sorry.
What do you want to do now?
- Paw Patrol puzzle!
- Build a Paw Patrol puzzle!
'Kay, go get your Paw Patrol
puzzle, we'll build it, 'kay?
(chuckles)
What is that, Calvin?
-  Um, hat.
-  It's a coat, oh,
and that's, what's that one?
-  Hat.
-  It's a hat?
- How does he know how?
-  He's doing good!
Oh, not there.
-  Nope.
I bet.
-  You bet?
- Yep.
-  You bet they go together?
- Yep.
-  What is your favorite toy?
- Puzzle.
-  Puzzles?
And what's your favorite toy outside?
- Finding rocks.
-  Finding rocks? (chuckles)
-  See.
(Calvin vocalizing)
-  Good job.
(laughing)
(Calvin wailing)
I'll close the door, don't
worry, I'll close it.
-  No, I will!
-  Oh, thanks, Jacks.
-  'Kay, you got it?
Okay.
-  Hold on tight.
'Kay, don't let go.
Hold on, Dad's gonna lift you up.
- Hang on tight.
Are you hanging on tight, Jackson?
- Yep.
-  (laughs)
Whoa, woo-hoo!
Hold on, don't let go.
(Calvin giggling)
(chuckles) Is Dad strong enough?
(Ellie and Jared laugh)
- You're such a good helper.
-  I wanna try it now.
-  Don't pull it,
Jackson, don't pull it.
-  (laughs)
Good job.
-  I wanna try.
-  Here, jump on.
-  Grab on the
front, hang on the front.
-  It's heavy, huh?
It's a beast.
-  All right, hang on to the front.
-  Okay, this
is getting a hot mess.
Jared, just put it down.
- Would you like to see
what I have in this box?
-  Yes!
- You would?
Well, would't you like to follow me?
And I would like to show
you what's in this box.
-  Would you
like some help? (laughs)
- Wouldn't you like to know!
-  Woo, I like!
- It's a piece of wood, if
you didn't get the joke.
-  Awesome.
- We're making some changes
in that baby's room,
and you already know this,
but we can't give away
everything all at once, so stay tuned
for more baby room updates.
You saw a little bit.
Wouldn't you like to see more?
(laughs loudly)
- Who's ready for a maternity try-on haul?
I am!
I have two dresses that
I have recently got
for the rest of my maternity.
I literally don't need
to buy anything else
for maternity clothes.
But our family is doing a
photo shoot for the cookbook,
and I got this dress for the photo shoot,
and now I'm like, "Maybe
I should wear this dress
"for maternity pictures."
I'll show you the dress that I'm going
to wear for maternity pictures,
and there's a reason why
I'm gonna wear that one.
Even though I think this
gown is very beautiful,
I really want to be able to show my belly
in my maternity pictures without me having
to like hold my belly, you know?
Like even though you can see it.
Well I don't know, in like
eight weeks, it's gonna be huge.
This is beautiful.
I thought I was gonna have
to alter it like crazy.
I mean, it's a little bustly.
It's beautiful.
It fits great!
Okay, I got this from Pink Blush,
and then I am going to try on my other one
that I'm gonna actually
wear for maternity pictures,
unless I try it on and I don't like it.
Okay, before I take the dress off,
when my sisters and I were ordering,
or choosing outfits for
the family photo shoot,
Julie got the same dress,
so she's gonna wear
a cream dress, I'm
gonna wear a pink dress,
and I'm actually, and
Julie's actually planning
on wearing this pretty
much this whole summer
after we have our babies,
because this'll be
perfect to nurse in as well.
So I think this is gonna be
really, I'm like, I'm shocked.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna try this one on.
Okay, and this is the dress I want to wear
for maternity pictures.
It's a little different.
A lot of maternity pictures are these
really flowy, pretty dresses.
But I thought that this
looked a lot like me.
I really like it, the flower sleeves,
I like the length of it, I
like that it's not too flowy.
I need a white bra, not a pink one.
And then by the time I'm
actually take pictures,
my belly will be much bigger.
But you know what, with this one, I might
have to hold my belly, too, for pictures.
You know what?
I might just do pictures
with both outfits.
I think I love this, though,
for my maternity pictures,
'cause it's just white, and
pretty, and crisp, and yay!
Yay! (laughs)
Oh my gosh, guys.
We only have three months left.
Three months left!
That's crazy.
- Holy crap, my heart is
pumping out of my chest.
That was crazy.
You guys know that every once and a while,
I will stream on Twitch, I'll
have the link down below,
Twitch.tv/JaredMecham.
And I've been playing
Fortnite because everyone's
playing Fortnite, it's a really fun game.
And I was in the top two positions,
so it was me versus this
other guy out of 100...
And I lost, ugh!
My hands were so sweaty.
But that was so much fun to stream,
there was like 80 people
in the stream with me,
it was just a ton of fun.
I want to do that a little bit
more, especially with Ellie.
We've been saying for years
that we want to stream,
like, Mario games and stuff like that.
So anyway, the night is upon
us, the kids are in bed,
we are going to eat dinner
and call it a night.
So thank you guys so much
for watching the video.
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.
Check out the description, and we will
see you guys next time.
Bye.
