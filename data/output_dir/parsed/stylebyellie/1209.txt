and Jackson is eating the bomb never you
can let go let go and it'll just stay
there now we're gonna go in and walk at

cabin we'll always remember that the
first time you felt Jackson was here
yeah yeah you remember that
I called him beaver dam Jackson kazoom
who felt him at the beaver dam I called
him damn it jack that's a fun memory to
have I think I think it's definitely fun
to have our first memory of feeling you
feeling Jackson was here at our family
cabin and now he's huge
yeah he's he's kind of I can't believe
he's on the 95th percentile for height
what we're sure we are not tall people
and then how did this happen unless he
takes up for grandpa breakfast or your
great-grandpa Meachem I don't know that
right but even still 95th percentile
purser come pop oh so well was there he
told me well and all my Meachem cousins
are huge
my brother is tall yeah yeah why are we
short dad Stan what the hairs man cuz
we're special why
why are mo not everyone can handle I
blaming you

Jackson is sitting here eatin this is
his second graham cracker and he's using
his two little bottom teeth and he has
