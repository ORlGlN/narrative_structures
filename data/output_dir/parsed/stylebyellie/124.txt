- Calvin may have just got in trouble.
Parenting, crazy.
(twangy gentle music)
- I'm glad we have each other.
- Yes.
Let's go out and play.
- Yay!
- Oh!
-  Why did you
think to clean it up?
- Because.
-  Because you knew Mama
would come and clean it up?
- No, but I'm a good cleaner.
-  (laughs) He's a good cleaner.
Where did Calvin go?
- He made a mess.
-  So he ran downstairs?
Calvin?
I know you're hiding behind the couch.
Come here.
I know I'm in my towel,
I know this is not a ushe,
but I just got the kids out of the tub,
just got them dressed for church,
and the moment I got in, I hear clink.
Again, my fault for leaving something out.
Thank you, I'll take it Jacks,
thanks, I appreciate it.
And Calvin totally dropped juice,
and I came out and
Jackson was cleaning it,
it was something I had to film so.
So cute.
-  So cute.
- So that's as much of
a bath as I'm gonna get,
a two minute bath.
(whimsical percussion music)
Why don't you film what
you and Calvin are doing?
-  Okay.
Calvin and I are
-  Hi.
-  Hi.
- Are you recording?
-  Yes.
(whimsical percussion music)
- I've been trying to pick up a little bit
before I get ready.
And we broke out these toys.
I can't find half of them.
They're the little
people, the nativity set.
The kids love these,
we break it out every year.
They've been playing with them lots,
but you know, I find a bajillion cars,
and I think Jackson did
something with our settings,
'cause it looks kinda, it
looks kinda funny to me.
Anyway, just picking up before church.
Hey Jared?
-  Yeah.
-  You know how you
put Calvin in his room?
-  Yeah.
- Well Jackson's in there with him.
-  Jackson's in there with him?
- Yeah.
-  Well as long
as they stay in the room.
- Yeah (laughs).
First, I have changed like three times
and Calvin may have just got in trouble,
so he's in his room,
and Jackson went in there
and is playing with him, while
he's in trouble in his room,
which I think is cute, but
- Calvin wants to be out.
-  Calvin wants to be out?
I'm sure he does.
Did you come in to play with him?
- Uh-huh.
-  You came in to play with Calvin?
'Cause you thought it was
sad that he was in here?
- Yeah.
- He really did not want
him being in trouble,
he's like noooo!
Okay, Calvin are you gonna be good?
Okay, come on, let's go out and play.
- Yay!
Pssh pssh.
Spiderman!
(laughs)
- Now finally, get ready for church.
So what are you gonna make for lunch?
-  I don't even
know what recipes we have.
Is there something that sounds good?
- Anything.
Anything'll do.
-  Well let's make sure
it something that sounds good
to you when I'm done.
- Okay.
I've been going really slow this morning.
-  Huh?
- I'm just filming.
- I've been going really slow this morning
and Jared said he had--
-  Sweetie I'm
sorry, I can't hear you.
- I'm just filming.
-  Okay.
(laughs)
- I've been going slow this morning
and Jared's like I'll make lunch,
because I was like, I don't even know,
I don't feel like making
anything right now.
So he's gonna make some lunch for us.
(boys laughing)
You hooligans, what are you doing?
-  Nothing.
Dad, are you in the shower?
-  I don't have any clothes on,
don't come in the shower.
- Yeah, don't get in the shower.
-  Calvin did
coming out of in his room.
-  That's okay.
-  He can.
-  He can.
-  Yeah, he's okay.
- I've been loving seeing the boys play.
I mean I feel like they've
gotten along really well,
like they've been so close in age,
that they've just gotten along.
But there's been so many times
where I especially look at them
and I'm just like, I'm so grateful
that they're playing right now.
Like some mornings are not smooth
and some are, and this
morning has not really
been the smoothest,
and I'm really grateful
that they're just following each other
around and just playing.
It's really helped me out a lot.
So I'm really grateful for that.
(bright electronic music)
- I'm about to Mr. Miyagi this,
just you wait and see.
So the goal here, I gotta flip this up,
oh front row seat,
I've gotta flip this up,
while it's in the air,
put this one on and then catch this one
out of the air, before it hits the ground.
-  Let's see it.
Ready?
Ready girl?
Ready (panting), ready?
(Ellie howling)
(Ellie laughs)
- Oh!
Did you see that?
-  That was amazing.
Let's get a slo mo replay of that.
(bright electronic music)
Oh!
-  Alright mister, you've
been a troublemaker today,
but I am very grateful that
you're eating broccoli,
so thank you.
(Ellie laughs)
You ate that all up.
Holy moly.
Is that yummy?
Wow, do you need a drink?
Wow, it's all gone.
Want another one?
Okay, there you go.
There's another one.
I think Penny wants one too.
Hi hi, do you want to wear this?
-  Yeah.
- You want to wear it now?
Hey.
Come up here to my face.
Calvin, come up here to my face.
(Calvin laughs)
(Calvin breathing)
-  Jackson?
-  Huh?
-  Are you in here?
- Yeah.
-  What are you doing?
What's on your mouth?
- Oreo.
-  Oreo, did you sneak in here
to have an Oreo?
- Yeah.
- Without us knowing?
Here's the deal bud.
I'm not mad that you had an Oreo.
I just with you had an Oreo
after we had dinner, okay?
You don't have to sneak around.
I'm gonna let you have an Oreo,
but it'll just have to be after dinner.
Penny lick his face, get that Oreo off.
Actually don't do that,
because it's chocolate.
Okay?
I'm not mad that you had an Oreo,
I'm mad that you snuck it.
Just ask, and we'll have
one after dinner okay?
Now that I've had some time
to talk with Jackson alone,
on a serious note, I don't like that.
I don't like that that he came in here
and snuck in here,
and it's not something
that I want him to do.
I am fine with him having an Oreo,
but I don't want him to sneak around
to get it, so I think it's
important that I caught him
and that I told him that.
I think he gets it from you.
- I'm not gonna deny it.
- So we got home from
church not too long ago
and look out outside.
It is so dark outside.
Daylight saving changed
while we were in China
and I'm still not used to it,
just how dark it get so fast.
It's 5:40 and it is dark.
-  Why do they even
have daylight savings?
- Well I think they're trying
to get rid of it actually.
- I think there's a lot
of parts that don't do it,
and a lot of people are
like, let's just stick with
I like the time it was before.
- Yeah.
- Right.
I think Arizona doesn't do it,
I think part of it, I'm not sure,
but I'm all for not doing
daylight savings time,
just 'cause half of our
clocks automatically switch
and half of our clocks don't,
so then I'm even more confused.
- It's like every six months,
you have to reteach the kids.
- Yeah exactly.
- Go to bed, but.
- It's nice when you get
an extra hour to sleep in,
but it's terrible for the kids,
because they don't care.
They're like I'm not gonna sleep in.
I'm gonna do what my body says.
And if that's Calvin,
that's wake up at midnight
and wake up at four inn the morning.
(laughs)
(mock cries)
Hey.
- What?
-  Do you like to sleep?
- Mommy's bed.
- Yeah?
-  In Mommy's bed?
- Yeah.
-  Oh and of course.
- I like to sleep in your bed.
-  You like to sleep in our bed?
- Yeah.
-  You actually slept in your bed
the whole night last night.
High five bud.
Yeah!
- Ya!
- So Ellie had me go to the store today
to pick up something,
and while I was at the store,
I had something that drove
me crazy happen today.
I had the cashier register person
comment to me about what
I had in my shopping cart,
and I was just like,
I don't like that, I don't
know is that bad, is that bad?
I don't think it's bad.
- It's not bad at all.
I think it's really unprofessional.
- Yeah, so she was like, oh,
looks like you're buying this,
what are you doing that for?
I'm like uh I don't know,
I don't want to explain
my situation to you.
What if I was buying like
- Lube for the car?
- Lube for the car.
(laughs)
That's right, that's what
I told Ellie earlier.
Or like tampons, or like
something, I don't know,
just like anything crazy like that.
I don't want to have to explain it to you.
- Well not even anything crazy,
diapers, rash cream.
- Yeah, why are you buying this?
I just, I need it, that's
why I need to buy it.
So I thought about it,
that's a huge pet peeve of mine,
is like for someone to
comment about the things
that I'm buying, it's just
like (stammers) anyway.
So I thought it would be fun
to make a video of our worst pet peeves.
-  Totally.
- So I'm compiling a list
of my worst pet peeves.
I have two so far.
And honestly, I'm a really
really easy going person.
Ellie, would you stand by that sentiment,
that I'm an easy going guy?
- Totally, but I do agree,
- Not a lot bothers me.
- I think that kind of
bugs me too, when people
I love talking to the cashiers,
-  Yeah.
- Like when we talk that's fun,
but when they comment
about what I'm buying,
sometimes I'm like uhhh.
- So I have a couple in mind already,
but what I would like you to do
is comment your worst pet peeve
in the comment section down below
-  Yes.
- and I would love to read through 'em.
Because I know we all have some.
I had some when I was a
kid that just bothered me,
but even in today's day and age,
it's like with all the
electronics and all that,
- When people tail you,
that's totally another one of Jared's.
- That is another one, oh.
I think it's because we're in Utah.
The Utah drivers are just not
the greatest in the world.
- We're bad.
(laughs)
I did want to say something,
before we end the vlog.
I hope Jared's okay with this.
We kind of talked about it earlier.
So, we were in China for a week.
We were ahead of videos for a week,
and right now we're two days ahead.
And we've had some questions,
saying are you guys gonna
continue to be ahead,
are you gonna go back
to being the next day?
That's something that Jared
and I have thought a lot about.
We've come to the conclusion
that we are gonna be two days ahead.
We are not not doing videos,
we're gonna keep doing daily videos,
it's just gonna be two day behind,
is that what I said, or ahead?
- I think they understand what you mean.
- Two days behind.
And the reason why we've
decided that is because,
we've been doing this for four years,
I've told Jared that one of the things
that I need to be doing
personally for myself
is just slowing down a little bit.
And that's a lot in my personal life,
that's a little bit with vlogging.
I just want to just be a little bit more.
I notice that with us
being two days behind,
it's helped Jared and I tremendously.
It's put a weight of stress off of Jared.
- I think when it comes down to it,
our marriage needs it.
- It does.
- And that's the most important
thing for all of this.
And I suggest, I mean I feel
like a lot of other people
should do it and because it does help.
I don't think it's
completely understandable
unless you are in this situation yourself.
- Yeah.
- Because it's like well you only film
for 15, 20 minutes a day,
but it is more than that,
but I think for the sake
of our relationship,
for the sake of our kids
and everything that goes along with it,
this puts us in a better situation,
so we're happier, the
content is more enjoyable
and all of that, so it works
out for everyone I think.
- It does, and part of that is,
instead of tonight, us watching,
you know, unwinding together
and then it's like 10 o'clock bedtime,
then Jared stays up really late
to edit for the next day.
But instead, he could've
already had yesterday's video
edited and then he could have that time
to go to bed with me.
- There's not a lot of
times where Ellie and I
go to be together,
and I don't think that's
the healthiest thing.
- Yeah.
So that's what we've decided.
And we know that some
people may not like this,
that's okay if that's how you feel.
This is what we've decided to do.
We're still doing daily videos.
But thank you for those of you
that do support us and
understand our situation.
And on a side note, this is where,
where Jared and I have
understood about this,
but the one thing we've kind
of had a disagreement with,
is like holidays
- Holidays.
- and birthdays.
- Yeah.
- And he's like well the holiday,
that'll still go out the next day.
And we don't know,
we'll still have to talk this out.
- Yeah.
- You correct me if I'm wrong.
- No I think we should
definitely talk about it more.
Because, just to show you where we are,
my thought was like let's
do it on the holiday,
have 'em go up, so it
just feels more in sync,
because those are identifying days.
- Yeah.
- But then Ellie's position,
which I totally understand,
is like, but then we're not
together on the holidays.
You're working hours and hours and hours.
- You know, Christmas night,
Jared will still be up
all hours of the night
and then be really tired
in the morning, because he's been editing
a crazy, fun day for us,
because that's the footage
that I want personally.
But then a fun extra
vlog is able to go up.
So I think we should still
stick with the two days behind,
even with holidays and
birthdays especially,
because those are our
days to really party.
- Yeah.
- Especially birth vlogs.
I told Jared, the next
time we have a baby,
it cannot go up the next day,
because I need, I just I
want you in the bed with me,
holding the baby with
me for hours and hours,
and of course we get that
awesome time together.
- Yeah.
- But there's just a few moments,
where I want to be selfish
and have you one more time.
- I spent eight hours
in the hospital editing.
- Yeah, for us.
And I'm not saying like that's
Jared and I having a conversation,
and we're allowing you to be a part of it.
- Yeah, this is a real conversation
we're having right now.
- And that footage is for us,
but it just doesn't have to,
but the going up the next
day is for other people,
and we've decided to let
it go for a few days later.
And take it back to, about us still.
- Yeah absolutely.
The cool thing, the most amazing thing
about what we do, which
we are so grateful,
is the ability to change and adapt
the things that we do.
Nothing is set in stone with YouTube.
And so we can change things,
we can adapt to things,
we can go back to things.
We've had the privilege and opportunity
to do this for such a long time.
- Agreed.
- And I love what we do and so, you know.
- But like we said,
thank you for listening
and thank you for supporting us
in the decision that we are making.
Today again, I've been
saying this every day,
this has been an interesting weekend.
(laughs)
I don't even know what we captured today.
I don't even know if it's good.
- Our brains are still kind of melted
from the whole weekend.
- But today was a day, where we have said
Calvin's middle name a thousand times.
They've been so good to play,
but they've also been
so naughty.
- So mischievous.
- So we are going to rest our eyes.
- But real quick, real quick,
I have to say this,
Ellie and I like, the kids do something,
and it's like you should not do something,
so we discipline them, and
then we look at each other
and we just start laughing, because--
- With them not in sight.
- They don't see us do that.
- We try not to.
- It's just like
- What were they thinking?
- What were they thinking?
This is kinda cute,
but I don't want them to do it again.
- Calvin's just made a lot of--
- Messes?
- He likes the soap dispenser and--
- Just put two and two together.
- And we've gotten upset
with him a few times,
but today we really
had to lay the law down
and he didn't like that.
Nor did we.
(laughing)
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Parenting.
It's crazy.
- I'm glad we have each other.
- Yes.
