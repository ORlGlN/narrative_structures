- And here we are!
- Dad!
- You got a little grumbly in your tumbly
is what you're saying.
- Is that not crazy?
Oh you're so perfect.
I'm trying to wake up and open my eyes.
It is 3:30 a.m. in San Francisco.
I am getting ready for the day
because I have an 11
a.m. photo shoot in Utah
for the cookbook with all of my sisters.
So I am up, trying to
open my eyes, get ready.
But I think I had a pregnancy
first about 10 minutes ago.
I'm trying to really think.
I sneezed and I peed a little
and I'm pretty sure I've never done that
with my other pregnancies, so.
Alright, my face is washed
and I'm now used to the light
so I will not squint at you anymore.
(playful music)
Dad's turn, open up your eyeballs.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Well we are certainly back in Utah,
it is cold, it is brisk, it is
- Crisp morning.
- We are walking over to meet
up with Bonnie and the kids
because, guess what Ellie,
you're not done with this adventure.
- I'm off.
- You have more stuff to do.
As soon as we get back here,
Ellie and Bonnie are
driving down further south
and they're gonna do another photo shoot.
Because that's what you girls do
as you shoot the video.
- But it's not like us, it's the food.
- It's the food.
You gonna make the food,
you gotta prep the food,
you gotta plate the food,
you gotta shoot the food.
- Are you like trying to
excuse spending an afternoon
playing with all my sisters?
- That's kind of how
this cookbook is gone.
Hey, you wanna play with our sisters?
Let's make a cookbook while we're at it.
And here we are.
- Hi.
-  Hi, hi guys, how are you?
- Calvin just woke up.
He's like what the ...
-  What's going on?
-  That means you woke up early.
- Yeah.
-  Oh no.
- As soon as he saw me, he was whaa
and then run out
and I couldn't find him.
-  That is so funny.
-  No, where was he?
- I listened quietly
and I found him under the kitchen table.
-  Look at his face, he is so mad.
- He's like scary Aunt Bonnie
in her underwear, nooo.
-  Did you close
his door last night?
- Yeah.
-  He opened it?
- Yeah.
- What?
- Jackson says where is my Mom?
-  Are you playing
with her earrings?
- I swear I didn't sleep
because I was anticipating him coming in,
so when he did walk in,
I was like yeah come here
and he was just like whaa.
- No way.
You're not my Mom.
-  If you would
have just shushed at that,
maybe he would have snuggled at you.
- I was so ...
-  If you weren't so over zealous.
-  So what did he
do after, you caught him?
- He just ran.
Oh he started whining and I was like,
you're not gonna wake
up the house, be quiet.
I was like, do you wanna get on Mom's bed?
He's like no.
I was like, go on your
own bed then and he did.
- Awesome.
Hey boys, do you wanna go
do something so fun with me?
-  Yeah.
- Do you wanna go ride a bus?
- Yeah.
- Okay, he had to think
about it for a minute.
Are you guys having so
much fun riding the bus?
- Up.
- Yeah, we're going up now.
- Where are we going up?
- We gotta go over this bridge,
so we can get to our car.
- Where is the car?
- At Missy's.
Okay boys, here's the deal.
Penny is getting a bath right now
and they said it'd be about two hours
until we can pick her up.
So we've gotta figure out
something that we can do
to kill two hours of time.
Any ideas, yeah?
Oh, I know just the thing.
Alright boys, we're here, we made it.
We're at the Tesla store.
- Yeah.
-  What do you guys think?
Do you like it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  You like it too?
What do you think Mom would say?
Do you think Mom would say,
should we get one or no?
- Eh, yeah.
-  Mom thinks so too?
- Yeah.
- You saw the big Model X
and now we're in the Model S.
This is the car, do you
like the car or the big one?
-  The big one.
- The big one?
-  And the small one.
- And the small one?
What do you see?
What is it?
- Bath bombs.
- Bath bombs?
Shall we go get Mom a bath bomb
and maybe you boys a bath bomb?
Jackson, should we get Mom
and you guys a bath bomb?
-  Yeah.
- Okay, that'll be a fun surprise for her.
Okay guys, I think that
was a successful Lush stop,
what did you get Jackson?
- Rocket bath bomb.
- Rocket bath bomb.
What did you get Cal?
- Rockgrr.
A rocket bath bomb.
And we got Mom a butter
ball and a new Jelly bomb
and it's filled with lavender
so it's like gonna help you
get to sleep or something.
So I'm anxious for her to try that out
and see what she thinks.
Okay, hold my hand and we'll cross.
Let's cross it, it's time for us to go,
let's hold our hands.
Here we go, we're crossing
the street safe and sound.
We're looking both ways
and we're crossing.
Do you like that train?
-  Yeah.
- That's cool, huh?
We should ride the train
some day, would that be fun?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- I would love to ride on train.
-  Okay.
- I don't cry on train.
- No, you don't cry on trains.
You don't cry a lot ever, do you?
- Nope.
-  And here she is, Penny.
You made it back, you're
here, you're safe.
You just walked around the corner.
Let's go, did you have
fun with your friend?
Did you play with your friends?
Such a pretty girl, all nice
and clean with your bath.
Ready, hop, good girl.
Well, after a long day of traveling,
we finally made it home.
And first thing we gotta
do is get our helmets on,
so we can ride our bikes.
(upbeat music)
My goodness, you blink
once and the sun is down.
Gosh, look how beautiful that sunset is.
It never does it justice,
you just have to take my word for it.
Having to pick up Penny threw
off our plans a little bit
because it was about
two, three hours later
than we expected.
So we played and had fun but
now it's like the day is over.
We played outside once we got home.
It's six o'clock, Mom's not home yet.
I feel happy for Ellie but kind of bad.
She's had three hours of
sleep, she's still gone.
It is six p.m. so she is
been going for like 48 hours,
doing high energy things,
smiling for pictures, having fun.
Would not trade this for the world
but I know she's tired and
she is so excited to go home.
What did you just say?
- Did you just buy me Lush?
-  What did you say before that?
- Did you buy me Lush?
-  What did you say?
- You bought me Lush.
-  Why, what did you say?
- I would like to sit in a tub.
-  Guess what?
- I still can't soak my back
but my butt can sit in there.
- Oh yeah, and your butt
needs to sit in there,
follow me.
- You ache.
- Follow me, grab my hand.
Have I got something just for you.
- Jared, if you got me Lush, are you guys.
I know I talk about it but
I know I don't buy a ton.
So if you bought me Lush.
-  Freeze, freeze right there.
Ba badababa baba.
- Why are you so perfect?
- Cause I love you.
So couple of things.
There are two things in there for the boys
and you'll probably know ones they are.
- I had hoped that
little airplane is mine.
-  So once you open them.
- Did they love it?
-  Oh yeah, they had so much fun.
- I swear my four-year old
really likes the Lush store too.
- Ah yeah, they love the bath bombs.
They're the ones that spotted Lush.
- Bonnie, your hair is in my sink.
-  Bonnie, that's so grose.
- Bonnie, my hair isn't ...
- Why is it that hair
off your head is grose
but on your head you're
like, oh it's so pretty.
- I don't think it's grose
cause it's my sister's.
Jared, that was so nice of you.
- So there's two things in here.
We got your normal butter ball
cause I like the butter ball
cause it's so moisturizing.
- Holy the Jolly.
-  Do you know what that is?
- A moon ball?
- It's a Jelly ball and
it's filled with lavender.
So it helps you relax at night.
After your long day traveling.
-  You're spokesman for Lush?
- I may as well be.
But listen ...
- So I'm just gonna sit right
here, just put right there.
- After a long day of traveling,
getting up at three in the
morning in San Francisco,
flying back to Utah, not stopping
and going to a all-day photo shoot
from 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.
- Thank you.
- This is gonna help you relax
and hopefully sleep well.
- So this morning I said I sneezed
and peed my pants for the first time,
I'm not kidding you,
all with Jackson and Calvin I
didn't have like bowel issues,
I didn't feel so much pressure
that I couldn't contain pee.
Multiple times today I have been like,
I gonna go now or I will pee my pants.
Like I have to go now.
It is the weirdest thing,
I feel so much pressure.
And it could be just like I've
been on an airplane today,
I'm a little like swollen,
you know, I don't know.
But like, like when I got
home, as soon as I saw the kids
I like kiss them and then I
was like, let me pee first.
- You got a little grumbly in your tumbly,
it's what you're saying.
- Is that not crazy?
I almost peed my pants
twice today, is that weird?
- Yeah, you and Calvin are
getting along just fine.
-  Oh my gosh.
- So I got you this stuff
because I want you to sleep well
because I have to wake up at five.
We're just doing this
left and right and crazy.
- Oh you got so much fun.
-  Yeah.
-  Sounds boring, Jared.
- The kids are finally asleep.
We're back from San Francisco,
Ellie is back from her photo shoot
and nothing has changed.
We are in our room at bed time.
- I told you I love you and kiss you.
- That hasn't changed either.
- Cause I haven't done that in a few days.
- We are in our bedroom, we've
got some snacks and a drink
and it's time to watch a show.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
You sneezed and peed a
little today, so that's new.
- That's new.
I hope I don't do it tomorrow,
I have a doctor's appointment.
-  You might do it tomorrow.
- I might, just to impress the doctor.
- There you go, look what I can do.
Bye guys.
