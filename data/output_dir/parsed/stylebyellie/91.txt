- Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
-  Is that the mommy horse?
- And that's the baby horse.
-  Oh fun.
Are you guys playin' with those horses?
That is a baby horse.
Good morning, boys!
How did you sleep?
- Good.
-  Good.
Calvin, what does a horse say?
- Neigh!
-  Yeah, that's right.
- I have had a very slow start to my day.
It is 11:00 and I'm just
now like getting up.
I did get the kids dressed.
That is a bonus.
The kids are dressed.
Last night I woke up
and I was not feeling well.
And sometimes when you wake up,
and especially when you are pregnant,
you can't go back to sleep until you eat
because you're stomach
feels so gross and empty.
And I have my stand here.
And this was full of nuts last night
and Jared brought it to bed.
I was like, "Will you go get the nuts."
I like laid in bed.
Half of em spilled.
I just like shoved my mouth full
until I felt good enough
to go back to sleep.
Anyway, today is the last day
that Jared and I are going to be going
over the grant videos.
We've been trying to go over them,
or we have gone over them
at night when the kids have gone to bed.
And we haven't started
em until like 10:00.
We usually stay up until 1:00.
And then last we planned on doing it
and I crashed.
And so, we're gonna do it today
and I've been a little worried like,
"What am I gonna do with the kids?"
It's Christmas break.
I don't want to call babysitters.
And this morning Jared and I opened a lot
of your guys' Christmas cards
and I loved seeing your families
and your Christmas cards.
Thank you to everybody that sent one.
And Nicole, she's awesome.
She works at a Disney store
and she did not have to do this,
but she sent the boys a Cars 3.
Like, this huge thing for the kids.
And honestly, thank you, Nicole!
It like came at the perfect time.
I kind of feel like tearing up a little
'cause I seriously was like,
"What am I gonna do today
while we go over these videos?"
And the kids...
And the kids are gonna play with that
while we finish going over
our work stuff for that.
And I'm just a little
emotional cause I've been,
I just have felt bad
cause I feel like I want
to be with the kids
and do stuff with them.
And even though I'm with them,
I just haven't quite had it in me
to do a ton of stuff.
So, I'm just feeling a
little guilt right now.
But, they're happy.
Like why am I boobin'?
Like, look at them.
(laughs)
They're fine playing with those.
Anyways, it was a very,
very, very nice gesture.
So thank you, Nicole.
You didn't have to do that.
But it is gonna help us a lot.
It'll keep them busy
I'm hoping for a good hour
while we finish up the work that we need.
What are you building?
- I'm just making,
I'm just building it.
- Oh, you're doing so good.
Calvin used it for his horses.
What are you gonna put in yours?
- I'm not putting anything in it.
- You're just building it?
- Mhmm.
- Yeah, I don't know why I felt flustered
a second ago 'cause I feel good now.
I think it was in the moment.
Jared missed that,
that little meltdown.
I'm good now.
- I'm glad you're good.
You've taken your little melted puddle
and you've kind of
shaped yourself back up.
You've folded yourself back into shape.
Is that what you've done?
- Ahhh!
I'm good.
- And Calvin has jewelry on.
- Come here.
Come give me my ring.
Thank you.
Aww, thanks.
Let me see the hair band.
K, play with your horses.
Where's your horses?
- I hope you have been
following me on Instagram,
specifically, my Instagram stories
because some magic has been happening
and I'm gonna show you the magic right now
between my Instagram story
and Bonnie's Instagram story.
-  I see you Hickory Farms.
Lookin' all sexy over there.
- Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,
Bonnie just posted an
Instagram story of her
at the mall and she's
getting Hickory Farms
and we need to do that today immediately.
- Ah, Bonnie!
Why didn't you invite me?
- We need to go.
Bonnie, Bonnie, save some
of it for us, please!
Save some for us!
- Jared, you better hurry up
because they are running out quickly.
I bought the last of this cheese.
They didn't have any
except in the gift package,
which I had to buy two
of just to get this.
So, hurry up, Jared.
Hashtag worth it!
- Ellie, we gotta go!
We gotta go!
- We're gonna go to Bonnie's house anyway
and eat snacks.
We'll eat hers.
- Oh, that's great!
And eat snacks!
- If you've never had Hickory Farms
during the holidays,
you are missing out.
It is the best.
It is amazing.
It is nostalgic for me.
And Bonnie has what is
probably the last two
Hickory Farms packages in Utah
where we live.
And that means we probably
aren't going to be
getting any ourselves, unless
we sneak into their house
and get some for ourselves.
So, I think it is time to initiate
operation mission mission
capture Hickory Farms.
I have parked a few
houses away from theirs
as to maintain no suspicion.
The clouds have enveloped around us
and now it is snowing.
Now I make my approach.
I pray that the snow
will make my footsteps
all the lighter.
(dramatic music)
Okay, I'm in front the house.
I don't think they've spotted me yet.
The question is,
"Can I get inside without
them seeing or hearing me?"
Okay, Bonnie's in the kitchen.
(drumming)
(screaming)
- Ah, no, you got me!
No, where is it?
Where is the Hickory Farms?
I need it!
You've disassembled it
all from its package.
- I know!
I have to like stash it and hide it
so nobody gets into it.
- Oh, my gosh.
It was a worthy effort.
I attempted, but I got caught.
Can I have some Hickory Farms?
(laughs)
- These little guys just
got in from outside.
You can see their noses are still red.
How was outside?
- Great.
- It was good?
It was great?
You're eatin' soup.
The one thing I did do today
was I did make a pot of soup.
It is snowing.
The kids did so good today
while Jared and I worked.
What else?
Calvin split his lip a little.
Looks good.
Daddy went to go grab some band-aids.
How's your soup?
- Good.
- Calvin, are eatin' it up?
Here you go.
Here's another bite.
- I have a surprise for you.
- What is it?
And there's me
and I still look the same at 5:00
as I did early, early this morning.
Jared and I are almost done.
We spent several hours
going over the videos.
Totally fell asleep.
I am so grateful
that I don't have a
huge headache right now,
but I definitely can
tell that it would happen
if I had a really busy day,
so I kind of have laid low.
I made some soup,
I vacuumed.
This is me.
Baby's growing.
Lots of hormonal stuff going on.
I definitely feel changes today.
My stomach has hurt
and my back has hurt a lot today.
I'm on my phone
so it probably looks silly.
I laid down on the couch
and I told Jared, I'm like,
"This is exactly how it feels
when you start to miscarry."
Like, your back aches so bad
and then your front aches really bad.
And I've just had lots
of aches and pains today.
And I know it's just growing pains,
but it makes me still
like, always worried.
But, I've had lots of pains today.
Now my head is starting to hurt.
So that's my spiel.
That's how we're doing today.
- Poor little guy, Calvin,
got a little, tiny owie above his lip
Right here when he was
playing with Jackson.
How's your lip?
Does it hurt?
Yeah?
Do you have medicine on it?
Is that gonna make it better?
Yeah.
Are you tough?
Yeah, you're tough, huh?
What was that?
Hey, we can't see!
Turn the light on so we can see.
(laughter)
I know just what to do.
Oh, there we go.
Thanks, Jackson.
Hey, do you want to know
what was so sweet?
Jackson, as soon as Calvin got hurt,
Jackson was so loving
and tender and careful
wanted to get him a band-aid right away
because you are just a
caring, loving brother.
- I'm a geni.
- You're a geni, yeah.
- No, I'm the boss.
- You're the boss?
Are you the boss baby?
- No.
- Just the boss?
While we were trying to
get Calvin taken care of
Jackson was just so tender
and sweet and was asking,
"You okay, Calvin?
"Do you want me to get you a band-aid?"
Did Jackson get you a band-aid?
Yeah, he did, huh?
He was very sweet to do that.
It's just cool to see these two interact
with each other and care for each other
and love each other.
Like, Jackson's primary concern,
at the moment, was making
sure Calvin was okay.
And I love that.
You'll just have a mustache
on for a little bit.
You can grow one better
than Dad in the meantime.
And in no time at all, you'll be better.
Okay?
- By the time this video is live,
you guys will already known who won
the IVF grants.
I still am in my jammies.
This is not like me
and you guys know that.
I just cut up a bunch of--
-  Heaven.
- Yes, heaven.
We'll just say that.
Cut those bad boys up.
We're gonna sit down.
It is now 6:00.
We really have shown you
pretty much what we've been doing all day.
I am unbelievably proud of the kids
because we've had to do
this all during the day
and they've been really good just to play.
- They have been playing
so good and so hard.
- So hard that Calvin split his lip open.
It's not too bad, but...
- What I'm proud about is
how he's been handling it.
Like, he cried for a second
but then he's just like,
"I really would just like
to go play in the snow, Mom.
Can I go play in the snow?"
- Yeah, I know.
It was cute.
They played in the snow.
So we are just wrapping
up here for the night.
Lots of emotions this week
for everybody involved
so, let's get goin'.
- I think one of the easiest parts
about doing this IVF grant contest
is that everyone who applies
is deserving of a grant.
Like, that's like the easiest part.
But, the hardest part is
that everyone who applies
is so deserving of a grant
and that's what makes this so hard.
Is that we only have so
many to give right now.
And it's just difficult,
and so I've taken a minute
to just come outside
and just think and just
be with my thoughts.
And...
Literally pray
and to have the guidance to decide.
It's tough, but the best part is,
no matter who we choose,
they are so deserving.
And it just makes it so easy.
No matter what decision we make,
it's a good decision.
You know what I mean?
Like, it's hard to explain with the words,
but it makes sense in my head.
I think what I'm gonna do
now is plow the driveway
and just be in my thoughts for a minute.
We got about four inches
of snow it looks like.
Got a bunch of snow
and so we're gonna plow that.
And just take some time
and think about these
last videos that we've been going through.
(peaceful music)
It's been an extremely emotional week
in a good way, but in a
heart-breaking way too.
Ellie and I have
literally watched hundreds
upon hundreds of infertility journeys,
but the one thing I saw
more than ever was hope.
So many of you have such strong hope
and that is what is so cool
about the infertility community
is that we never give up.
And, we go through all of these things
and we never give up.
So, thank you for sharing
your stories with us.
Thank you for taking the time to apply.
I wish you all the best.
My heart is with each
and every one of you.
I feel like I know a little bit
about each and every one of you,
and my heart is with you.
As is Penny's.
So, with that,
me and Penny girl are gonna say goodnight.
Thanks for watching guys
and we'll see ya tomorrow!
Bye!
Say bye, Penny.
Bye guys!
