- Last night something
very cool and very special,
especially to Mom and
Dad, happened last night.
What would you do if you weren't afraid?
-  I went from
looking at 19 weeks pregnant
to 22 weeks pregnant!
Calvin likes Penny a lot more
when she's eating a treat
'cause he can have the time to pet her
'cause she doesn't move around so much.
Is that your puppy dog?
She's your puppy, huh?
- No.
Hey!
-  Oh, fine.
She's Penny.
(laughs) That was cute.
No, Penny.
- No.
- He's watching the kids play.
Calvin's on his bike.
Oh and Jackson's on his bike, too.
I thought he got on the hoverboard
but he's on his bike now.
Good morning, guys!
We have got the house cleaned.
We have got all of our tummies fed.
Got my bed made.
The kids did so awesome last night.
We've been really working with them,
telling them to stay in their beds,
and not come into our bed at night,
which I haven't minded having the kids
come in our room at night
but I am trying to prep
and get everything ready
for when the baby does come
because I would hate
for the kids to continue
to get in our bed at night
and then the baby comes,
the baby wakes them up,
or just kind of like disrupting everybody,
and so they did so good last night.
They all slept in their
beds all night long
and I'm really proud of them.
So they're outside playing right now
and I'm getting ready for a fun date.
I'm going to the Albion party tonight.
I was invited!
I was so excited so I'm
getting my hair dried,
getting it curled.
I didn't sleep much, though,
'cause if you guys saw my Instagram story
or if you saw our vlog from
yesterday, we showed my back.
(gasps) It is so much
worse than I thought.
Like, the cut is that long.
Crazy.
So I didn't sleep much 'cause
I was like rolling around.
I think when it heals a
little bit more in a few days
it'll feel better to like sleep on.
Hi, baby!
How are you?
Okay well I'm getting dressed.
I'm wearing a dress tonight
because it's kind of fancy
and dresses are super
comfortable right now.
Bonnie has been giving me
a little tip on my hair.
I was asking her, "Is it still cute short?
"Is there anything I should
do different with it?"
And she said, "You always
curl the midshaft to the end."
She goes, "Curl the top a little tighter.
"Have it be a little
more like umph to it."
And I was like, "Oh I need
a smaller curling iron."
Went to the store.
I didn't really see any that
I liked and then I was like,
"Can I go to your house
and borrow a curling iron?"
So I went to her house.
Lo and behold!
This is my flipping curling
iron, Bonnie! (laughs)
She had my curling iron at her house.
Totally forgot that I had it.
I love that it's short right here, big.
It's the NuMe Wand,
just like my other one that I always use,
but it's tighter so it'll be really tight
on the top of my hair.
So funny, huh?
You forget what you have
and then your sister has it,
then she forgets it's yours
and 10 years later you get it back!
So, with my hair, I'm
literally just taking sections
and curling it right to the scalp,
but leaving like an inch out
and then when I'm all
done, I'll fluff it up.
(light music)
While I sit and wait for my curls to set
before I ruffle them up,
I'm going to watch a YouTube video.
And Bonnie keeps saying, "Have you watched
"my San Francisco video yet?"
And I have been dying to watch it.
I just, I haven't yet so I'm watching
her San Francisco video
and I'm getting ready!
- So when I went to do
my hair this morning,
I was looking for my product
and I realized that Joel
had taken it from me.
What the heck, Joel?
So I went over to his
house and I grabbed it.
For those of you who don't know,
the product that I use the most
is Paul Mitchell Flexible Style Spray Wax.
It's a nice, hearty spray
wax that goes on really soft
but it holds really well,
and then once I actually do my hair,
I top it off with some Bed Head TIGI.
Just a little bit!
Just to keep that shape and hold.
The nice thing is the Paul
Mitchell gives it a nice dry hold
but then the hairspray gives
it a nice little shine texture,
so you've got the best of both worlds.
Don't you agree with that Jackson?
- Yeah.
- Doesn't my hair look nice?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think your hair looks nice, too.
You've got that nice little
tweaker going on in the back.
It's just your style.
It's just what compliments you a lot.
So, yeah, that's what I do
is I just kind of brush my hair up.
I get the volume.
What?
- It's curly.
- It's curly?
Do you like the curly Q's?
- Uh uh.
- Do you want your hair like
Daddy's or like Mommy's?
Like me?
Okay.
Maybe we can fix your hair.
So now that I've got my product back.
(fake laughs) Thanks, Joel!
Just kidding!
I'm just kind of making fun of Ellie
and what they did but yeah.
Okay, boys.
Let's do your hair, silly pants McGee,
before we go.
Okay? Sound good?
You've got some coins, too.
When your piggy bank is full,
we can go get them exchanged
for dollar bills, too.
(light guitar music)
(Calvin laughs)
Alright so last night something
very cool and very special,
especially to Mom and
Dad, happened last night.
Can you tell us what happened?
- We slept in our own beds too much.
- Yes, you did!
You slept all through the night.
Both of you!
You didn't get out of bed
and Mommy and Daddy slept the whole night,
so high five.
Congratulations!
High five right here, Cal.
Boom!
So one thing that the
boys have been doing,
they've been staying in their
room really, really great
but they've been waking up
in the middle of the night.
That's nothing new.
They've always done that
but sleeping through the
night has been something
that they've struggled with
and they did it for
the first time together
and it was amazing so--
-  Since Christmas!
- Yes, since Christmas.
I guess since Christmas Eve, right?
-  Yeah.
- Since Christmas Eve.
So when you woke up this morning,
I came to your room and
what did Dad have for you?
- Question mark box.
- Yeah and inside that
question mark box from Mario,
what was inside?
Boom!
A Mario hat.
A Mario coin.
A toadstool thing.
We had a box from Mario that was so cool.
Oh, we just did your hair.
Let's not put that on.
- Hey!
(Jared laughs)
- Thank you for sleeping all night long.
Give me a hug!
- Gimme, gimme!
- Love me!
-  Well, you look beautiful!
- Thanks!
- And I am so happy with
how my hair turned out!
It is like full and like ready to party!
- It's super flirty--
- I love it.
- It's flirty and fun.
- Yahoo.
(upbeat guitar music)
I went from looking 19 weeks pregnant
to 22 weeks pregnant!
I've been eating so much, guys.
I'm spoiled and we got
to go to The Melting Pot.
Yay!
Ashley!
This is our friend, Ashley.
I went to The Melting
Pot earlier this week
with my girlfriends,
and then with us going
to the party tonight,
we wanted to go to dinner
before so Melting Pot again.
So we're getting our cheese
and we're ordering our chocolate next.
There you go.
(laughing)
Now you can blow it out
now that I got the shot.
(laughing)
Thank you!
That's awesome.
This looks wonderful.
(upbeat guitar music)
After baby comes, that's
the swimming suit I want!
(upbeat guitar music)
- Hey, there.
Long time no talk.
It is midnight and I just got home.
I drove two hours south to Utah Valley
and I was able to go to a
meeting of Richie Norton
and a couple of his buddies
that they have a business together.
The meeting was all about some principles
that Richie has taught for a long time,
and it was just really, really great.
I find myself in periods of time
where I am super motivated to do things
and then I kind of find
myself in a little slump.
And then I get back into the
super motivated period of time.
Right now I'm in that super
motivated period of time
and I don't want to get
into that slump period
and everything that I've
talked about in the past,
I've tried to act on the
things that I've said
that I would do and, you know,
practice what you preach.
I love self-help, motivational speaking,
I love all of that stuff
because it's so cool to hear
and to learn and to apply.
And the application is
the most important thing.
You can hear and teach all of these things
but the application is
the most important thing
and we're applying a
lot of different things,
and that's why I keep saying
2018 is going to be so amazing
is because we're applying
a lot of these things
that we've learned and
you'll see that very soon.
But I just wanted to come on
and just talk about a couple
things before we end the vlog.
I've said a lot in the past,
"What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
And we've talked about that.
That's kind of been a
theme that I've brought
to Ellie and I, and our family,
and to the vlog channels.
What would you do if you weren't afraid?
But I feel like the last year,
I've kind of forgot that.
And, you know, a period of down time
and now I'm super
motivated again. (laughs)
It's funny how it just comes in waves.
But I'm asking myself what
would I do if I weren't afraid
but not only that like,
what would you want to do?
And then my next question is,
what's stopping you and
why is it stopping you?
In my mind right now, I'm
thinking about retirement.
Like 65 years old retirement.
What will I want to do when I'm like,
when I'm retired this is going
to be what I'm going to do,
I'm going to finally
relax when I'm retired.
Those kinds of things.
I think of my dad.
I think of Ellie's dad.
When we're finally retired,
what do we want to do?
If we have that mindset, we're
always going to be waiting.
What is stopping us right now
from doing the thing that we want to do?
And so I'm just kind of thinking
about that and thinking,
if I'm putting myself years
ahead of where I am now,
what will I look back on and regret?
I am so grateful that Ellie
and I decided to do this
and so many other ventures
that are happening later on.
And I don't want to live
with excessive regret.
I'm sure there's going to be some things
that we regret in the future.
I don't want to have excessive regret
to the point where I wish
I would have done something
where I have the opportunity
to do it right now.
What would you do if you weren't afraid?
I got home.
I've been having a
two-hour car ride there,
a two-hour car ride back,
and I've just been thinking
and I don't even know
if any of this makes sense to any of you.
It may be like, oh, Jared,
you're just talking again.
Another part of why we do this
is this is a journal for us.
This is something I can look back on
and I know that today is going to be a day
that, going forward,
things are going to change
and be exciting for us.
This is the start of something new.
I want this to be a moment
where I look back and be like,
right there is where it happened.
So thank you for listening.
(laughs)
It's kind of funny but when I vlog,
I imagine you that I'm talking to.
Not that I'm talking to a camera
but I imagine our audience.
I try and picture our audience
as like one individual
and I'm talking to you and I'm thinking.
But I'm also talking to
myself, talking to Jared.
So it's kind of funny holding a camera,
imagining you and imagining myself.
Whether that's future Jared or past Jared.
But I'm grateful for the support,
I'm grateful for what we do,
I'm grateful for my family,
there's just a lot of gratitude
in my heart right now.
That is where I'm going to leave you.
Thank you so much for watching.
This weekend is going to be a blast.
We're gonna have a lot of family around.
It's the Super Bowl.
Who are you rooting for in the Super Bowl?
I guess by the time the video
goes up, it's already done.
We already know who decided
so congratulations to
those people who won.
But thanks for watching, guys
and we will see you next time.
Bye.
