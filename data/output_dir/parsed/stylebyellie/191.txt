(phone ringing)
-  Hello.
- Hi, mom, how are you?
-  I'm good. How are you?
- Good.
Hey, I've got a quick question for you.
Can you think of any embarrassing stories
from when I was in school?
-  The twins in kindergarten.
- Yeah?
-  I don't know if
you felt embarrassed,
but I was ready to rip those girls apart.
(laughs)
(upbeat music)
(alarm ringing)
(playful music)
(rooster crowing)
- Good morning, guys.
Welcome to a normal hour of the vlog.
Ellie is out running an errand right now,
and the kids are still asleep,
so I thought it would be
a great time to clean up
as much as I possibly
can while Ellie is gone
so she comes home to a nice, clean house.
(energetic music)
(gasps)
(dramatic music)
I'll just worry about that later.
(energetic music)
(snaps fingers)
Hi, Ellie, welcome home.
- Thank you, Jared.
- Could you tell a difference?
- I walked in the house.
I was like, "Jared, this looks
so beautiful, thank you".
I seriously had to run a crazy errand.
We're doing something very
fun in this spot, guys.
I have loved everything we have done,
but I do feel like we
need some color in here,
and my friend is amazing at painting,
and that's all I'm gonna tell you,
but I had to run an errand.
-  Suspense.
-  But this whole
space is gonna be beautiful
in about a week.
- It's a painting of me, isn't it?
-  Perfect.
- Let's go back to this morning.
I have to be so quiet.
I wanna show you this first.
(gentle lullaby)
Calvin is a stinker.
That is the only way I can describe him.
He is a stinker, not only with his poops,
but with his actions.
This morning, I think, at
three o'clock, four o'clock,
five o'clock, he got up,
and he didn't just get up.
He was up, and he was staying up,
and we tried to put him back to bed,
and he just would not do it.
- I swear this is the story
of Ellie and Jared's life.
-  Seriously.
- It was four in the morning,
and I was like, "What the
heck," and I came out here,
and he was just on the
floor playing with toys
in the living room, just up and at 'em.
- Yeah, and he's like,
"I'm not going back to bed.
"I'm up for the day".
What was it: 7:30, eight
o'clock, he's like,
"Okay, I'm gonna go to sleep now".
Got up on the couch, pulled
the blanket over him,
and he went to sleep, which is like the--
- Calvin, you are best and the worst.
- Exactly.
I mean, four o'clock to what?
Eight o'clock, and now it's 10 o'clock,
and he's still asleep.
-  Turd.
- Thank goodness.
You are a turd, but I love you.
- I'm really hoping their AC is broken.
(laughs)
- We will not turn the AC on.
- We are in Frank, guys--
-  Hi, Frank.
- Bonnie's house is so cold.
You Cullen and Brian, Katie,
and Missy would all get along
very well, because they all like it cold,
and Jared and I are like,
"We want it a sauna".
- Please keep it warm. Please.
Boo!
Dang it.
-  It wasn't scary.
I knew you were back here.
- You knew?
Just, I went for it. I went for it.
- I said lunch was gross.
(laughs)
- One of the best parts
about being a parent
is being able to
introduce to your own kids
the things that you loved as a kid,
and we've been doing that lately.
What have we been watching?
- Care Bears.
-  Care Bears, and
where do Care Bears live?
- Care-a-Lot.
- Yeah, as a kid, my family
and I, we watched Care Bears.
We loved the movies, so Care
Bears has a special place
in my heart, because I
grew up on it as a kid,
and, this year, Care Bears are celebrating
their 35th anniversary.
Now, to celebrate this 35th anniversary,
Care Bears is announcing a limited edition
rainbow heart bear.
Do you wanna see it?
- Yeah.
-  K, ready?
- What?
-  Here it is.
Does that look so cool?
Aw.
Can you give him a hug, Calvin?
Yeah, do you see that?
What do you think of his belly badge?
- It's cool.
-  Yeah.
- It shoots power.
- It does.
That's right.
Care Bear stare!
Every year, on September
9th, Care Bears celebrate
their national holiday,
Share Your Care Day.
Share Your Care Day is
all about celebrating
acts of kindness whether
they're big or small,
whether you're helping your
mom, helping your brother,
or helping someone across the
street with their groceries,
anything at all.
It's all about celebrating kindness,
and that's exactly what we
like to do with our friends
and family and those around the world.
This year, Care Bears is
celebrating Share Your Care Day
in Los Angeles,
California, and guess what?
- What?
- Jackson, they invited
you and Calvin and us
to go celebrate.
-  We're gonna get on an airplane,
and we're gonna fly to California,
and we're gonna celebrate
Share Your Care Days
with the Care Bears.
- I wanna go to Care-a-Lot.
-  You wanna go to Care-a-Lot?
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!
Not only that; we're
actually going to have
a very special meet and greet
at that event in Los Angeles.
I'll have all of the information listed
in the description down below.
It's gonna be a great time,
and we would love to see you there.
If you guys would like to get
your own rainbow heart bear,
they have them at Walmart,
Kmart, Toys "R" Us,
and QVC until December.
(gentle music)
That's good.
Got it.
(gentle music)
Okay, I have to print out some papers,
and some of those papers
are for passports,
and I'll tell you about
those a little bit later,
but the short story is
our printer that we've had
for, I don't know, six
years, or ever since
we were in college,
finally ran out of ink,
but we don't print that
much, because everything
is done electronically
now, and I went to go print
some of this stuff, these
papers out, no ink whatsoever.
I went to the store today
and looked at ink costs,
and it was a much as a new printer,
so I was like, "Let's
just get a new printer
"that has, like, wi-fi and
all of that good stuff,"
so I got this guy from Best Buy,
and it was a lot cheaper than the ink
and has all the cool stuff with it.
The goal is to have it set up down here
so it's out of the way still
being able to reach wi-fi,
and I can just print it down
here, if that's gonna work.
Crossing our fingers.
(gentle music)
All right, we have movement.
It is printing out the test
and alignment pages right now.
I think there's two or
three of these bad boys,
so we'll take a gander
here in just a second.
All right, we've got our last page coming.
- To Cullen and K-A-T-I-E, send.
- All right.
What the heck?
Subscribe to Cullen and Katie?
How is that even possible?
(laughs)
- Yes.
Let's go.
-  One, two, three.
-  Get it, girl!
Don't let this image fool
you, this quiet image.
Two seconds ago, we
had two screaming kids.
- You mean, we're not like
the Cleavers all of the time?
- No.
Are you all good now?
- Cookies.
- Cookie?
Wowsers, he was crying,
'cause Calvin wanted
to grab his cookie.
He just woke up from a nap.
Calvin just woke up from a nap.
Our day today has kinda been a theme.
Wake up early, be cranky, and
we're gonna go to bed early
and be cranky.
I've got dinner going.
It is broccoli, pesto, and some noodles.
It called for some sausage,
which meat did not sound good
at all, and I skipped that
out, and we're just doing this.
I just need to move it onto the plates,
and we are ready to eat.
I've been wanting to make peach pie.
My family, when we were
starting some of the recipes
for the cookbook, we did
do some peach pie filling.
Ruby had went home and just made it,
and I'm so jealous, because
I want to eat some peach pie,
but I just haven't had it
in me to quite make it.
I may just eat peaches and
cream, and that may be it.
Do you guys like peaches and cream?
I don't know if that's weird.
I feel like a lot of things
I do, some people are like,
"That's kinda gross or
weird," but just like peaches,
milk, and a little tiny
bit of sugar on top.
Yes, no?
Anyway, I'm starving,
so we're gonna eat this.
Color is that?
-  Blue.
(laughs)
- Oh my gosh, I just grabbed the camera,
'cause Calvin came up, said, "Black".
We're learning our colors,
and then I just asked him,
and he said, "Blue".
What color is this?
- Blue.
-  You just said black.
Say, "Black".
- Black.
- It is black.
(laughs)
Color fail.
He was so excited to tell
me that it was black,
and I was like, "That's right,"
'cause he always says everything is blue.
(phone ringing)
-  Hello.
- Hi, mom, how are you?
-  I'm good. How are you?
- Good.
Hey, I've got a quick question for you.
Can you think of any embarrassing stories
from when I was in school?
-  The twins in kindergarten.
- Yeah?
-  I don't know if
you felt embarrassed,
but I was ready to rip those girls apart.
(laughs)
- That's awesome.
Well, okay, well, I just
wanted to call and ask.
Thanks, mom.
Okay, I have to give some
context to that story
that my mom and I were just talking about.
I was in kindergarten,
and the bus stop stopped
right outside my house,
so my mom would wait
right outside for us, and she would see us
as we were driving down,
and there were two twins,
and I grew up with 'em.
They're friends of mine,
but, in kindergarten,
they sat next to me almost
every single day on the bus,
and they sat on both sides
of me, and they would just
kiss me on the cheek the whole time
I was riding my bus home,
and I would get off the bus,
and my face was just bright red--
- I think that's the cutest thing ever.
- It is.
Well, it's just like my mom--
- I can picture them doing.
You're so cute.
- Obviously, I can't remember
if I was embarrassed,
but my mom was like, "Those girls".
- Oh, I bet, I bet.
- I'm sure I liked it.
- I'm sure you did.
- I didn't get kissed after
that for years and years.
- Jared asked me, he's like,
"Ellie, was there an embarrassing
story of you in school,"
and I'm sure there are tons,
but, when I was in junior high,
and I totally went to a health
class for like three weeks
thinking it was a biology class, and then,
after three weeks, the teacher
and I couldn't figure out
why I wasn't on the roll,
and that was a ruckus.
- I remember you telling me that.
- But it was really getting
into the health stuff.
I'm like, "I think this is"--
- You're like, "Wait a second".
- This is not biology.
Anyway--
- That is so funny.
- Totally dumb.
- There's a couple more.
This is what sparked all of this up.
I posted an Instagram picture.
You can follow me on Instagram right here,
about memorable moments on
your first day of school,
and then I was just like, "What
about our most embarrassing
"stories at school," and,
speaking of that, your story,
I remember in college.
This is how bad it was.
In college, I forgot to go
to a lab the entire semester,
and I felt so--
- You had a dream.
- Yeah, that is my worst
nightmare, and I think that's why.
- 'Cause you did it.
- And I felt stupid.
I was so embarrassed.
I can't believe I forgot
to go to that class.
I ended up retaking it
just to get a better grade.
I did okay.
Like, I did okay without the lab,
but I wanted to get a
better grade, so I did that,
but, second grade, you're
seven, eight years old
in second grade.
It was Winter time, and we
were having a snowball fight
outside, and the duties.
We called them duties.
- Yeah.
- Do you? Supervisors.
Anyway, the adults who were
outside when you have recess
got really mad at us
and took us inside early
and told our teacher, and our
teacher got really mad at us
for having a snowball fight.
Like, it wasn't bad.
- Oh, I was always in
trouble for snowball fights.
- And they said, "You need to
go to the principal's office,"
and my heart sunk.
It just dropped to the
floor, because I was a kid.
I never got in trouble in school.
I was a good kid, and
anything remotely bad,
I just quivered and just
shriveled up into this little ball
of fear--
- That happened to me.
I had to stay in recess for like a week
and write, "I will not throw snowballs,"
like a flipping thousand times,
and my mom ended up calling,
and they're like, "She's not doing that".
After three days, she like, "She's done".
- Like Bart Simpson.
- Oh yeah, and it was like, "No".
I got my punishment, but she's like,
"You don't need to be
doing this for a week".
- Yeah, there are so many
embarrassing stories that,
now that I'm thinking about
it, but I wanna pass this
on to you guys.
What are your most embarrassing
or most memorable stories
from your first day back to school
or just throughout school?
Let us know in the comments down below.
Now, it's time to say
goodbye to all our family.
I don't know if that's the
word, but it's time to go.
Thank you guys so much
for watching the video.
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.
Let us know if you have any
crazy, embarrassing stories

Bye.
