right up there that they've been playing
music and everything and we found out
that Jackson's teacher is actually going
to be singing up there so we're going to
go out there and were going to listen

ride the bull now are you sure you're
man enough to ride the bull

Calvin is out Jenna's been talking so
Thomas birthday's coming up and my mom's
cousin I seen you whenever you go to his
house he has a four wheeler and you make
these buckets with wheels on this like
ten of them that put the poles the the
four-wheeler pulls yeah and I think we
should make that because our kids are
neighborhood kids with all of it

bucket really slow around the
neighborhood and kids love it
