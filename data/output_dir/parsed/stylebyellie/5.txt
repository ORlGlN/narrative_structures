♪ Yeah, singing my cleaning song ♪
- I mean, I didn't mean to say that.
I feel like the weather's
playing games with my heart.
- How did you do that?
- Magic.
- All right, who's gonna
help me water some plants?
- Me.
- Me.
-  Where's your water buckets?
What!
'Kay, put them under here.
We just need a little bit,
that's probably great.
Now Calvin's turn. (chuckles)
Oop! (chuckles)
Perfect.
So the kids planted some
flowers the other day,
and I planted something special.
We'll see if it works
out, but we are gonna
try and water these, and keep them alive.
It's snowing outside currently. (laughs)
'Kay, will you water
this one, and I'll let
Calvin water those?
All across it, perfect.
What do you think of it?
- I want it to grow.
- (laughing) Me too.
We're gonna watch it every day, though,
and see when they start to sprout.
Do you wanna bring it over?
- Mm-hmm.
-  What is this?
-  'Kay, bring it over.
Oh, part of the dirt.
The soil.
(chuckling) Your face looks confused.
It's just part of the soil.
- I wanna cover it.
-  'Kay, take your
finger and push it in then.
Perfect.
And Calvin, we're gonna
move them all over, oop!
There you go, that way
not one just gets watered.
And your water's gone. (laughs)
- I wanna do some--
-  Do you have more water?
'Kay, can you finish these two?
Good job.
(laughing loudly)
♪ DuckTales, woo-oo! ♪
- Sorry, I didn't even know
Jared was in the shower,
I just heard you singing like crazy.
♪ DuckTales, woo-oo! ♪
(laughs loudly)
Calvin.
Let's brush your teeth, come on.
(pleasant music)
It looks like spring
inside, but winter outside.
We're matching!
- Mm-hmm.
- I like your shirt!
-  I like your shirt.
- Um, I got, Julie and I
when we were out making
bath bombs last week,
me and her, we both got
matching kimonos from Anthropologie.
So hopefully one of these
days, Julie will wear it
the same day and we'll be matching.
- Ellie has been going to the
chiropractor for months now,
and I have been asking her
to take the camera with her
so she can film the cracking sounds.
(Ellie laughs)
It's hard to film when you're actually
getting the work done,
so I'm coming with Ellie
(Ellie laughs)
and we are going to hear those cracks.
So, with that being said--
- What that, the sound of that is
your headache is now dismissed.
-  That's right.
- It's clockwork.
- Yeah. So with that being
said, if you're sensitive
to anything like that, just
skip ahead a couple seconds.
Otherwise, enjoy it with me.
-  Unless she says
we can't film. (laughs)
- Yeah, we'll check first, obviously.
(cracking)
- It's crazy every time, Jared, my neck.
(cracking)
(Ellie chuckles)
Hey, girl, I had a good meeting.
- Bye, we'll see ya, girl.
-  Bye!
- Bye!
Little snap, crackle, and pop there, huh?
How do you feel now?
- Um, you guys, I'm not even kidding you.
Like, go to a chiropractor!
Growing up, we never went.
But it's very in my routine
now, in my life routine.
- Well, and that's the funny thing,
because the chiropractor
I had, I didn't like.
So your mileage may vary.
(chuckles)
But Ellie swears by it.
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to close that on you.
- That's okay, I can open my own door.
Psh, come on!
-  You always make me laugh!
Why are you closing your eyes?
- Where's your closet?
- (laughing) Where is it?
So the last few nights,
I have been working
on just organizing all the kid's closets,
getting the baby's closet ready.
The boys have been sharing a
closet the last few months,
and I want to show you guys kind of how
I've been organizing it.
I just wrapped up a meeting
with Bonnie and Joel
and Jared about our Bollie line.
We are working on some new pieces,
some more sizing options
on our Bollie account.
It's over now.
We just had a flash sale
on our Easter dress,
which I cannot wait to wear!
And it's just been a learning process,
it's been a growing
process, it's been so fun.
And my mind is like, blown
every time we get together.
But we only have 60 dresses
left of the extra large,
so if you guys are still
needing a summer dress,
we only have 60 left of
those ones in that size.
So don't forget to check out
our website at BollieBrand.com.
We are gonna go show them our closet.
Should we start with the baby's?
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.
So we've been working in the baby's room.
We have the rug down.
We're working on the shelving right now.
(chuckling) It's been a hot mess.
Jared and I went to do
the shelving yesterday.
Ripped one of these out.
It hasn't been very pretty,
but we're gonna get there.
So I need to go into town
sometime and get a car seat,
and when I get a car seat I'm gonna get
some organizers for the closet.
But the baby, I've
never had child that has
so many clothes in their closet.
There are so many extra
clothes for the baby
because of Jackson and Calvin, like,
these are all of Calvin's
leftover clothes.
There's some new clothes for the baby.
He got some new jammies from Old Navy.
These are the softest
jammies in the world, guys.
But those are his clothes.
His shoes are down there.
- How does his feet doesn't come out?
-  It keeps his feet warm.
- But I wanted one.
-  (chuckling) You
used to wear stuff like that.
Should we find you a onesie jammie?
- (chuckling) Yeah.
-  Maybe when we go to Target,
they'll have one for you.
But all of his swaddle
blankets are right here.
-  When I'm a baby?
-  They might
have a big size for you.
- Heh, why?
- (laughs) 'Cause you
want one, so we'll see.
We'll have to see if they have a big size.
- So funny.
-  Would that be silly?
- Yeah!
-  We have his swaddle
blankets, and his hats.
His burp rags, and his bibs.
And then I want to get a little
organizer for his medicines.
Even though we have a medicine cabinet,
I just feel like the first
year of a baby's life,
like, especially around six months,
like when they're teething tons,
you need gas relief drops, and you need,
like, teething gel and stuff.
I just kind of like having
it in the baby's room.
So I would like to get a little cubby
or a little organizer for that.
And then I'll just put, like,
look at his little shorts.
His little shorts right here.
And then he just has some binkies there.
So, I mean, it's not way organized,
but it's kind of organized enough.
So my goal today is to
get a few organizers
for the baby's closet,
and to get a car seat.
- Do you wanna see some magic?
-  Yes, I do.
(coin clanking)
(Jared gasps)
-  Whoa!
-  Nice job!
Good job, bud!
- Dad, I want you to try.
(coin clanking)
How did you do that?!
- Magic!
(laughs)
- He is so good!
So the boys closets have
actually been really nice.
They've been sharing a closet, and Jackson
has this whole side plus
a shelf for his pants.
And this is perfect because Jackson comes
and gets ready by himself every day.
He likes to get dressed by himself.
Very little does he want me to help him.
- And someday I'll want
you to get me dressed.
- Some days, but not most days, huh?
Yeah, most days he's like, "I can do it!"
So he comes in, he grabs, he puts his jam,
I tell him to put his jammies away.
Half the time I do that.
But he puts his socks on,
he puts his underwear on,
and then he has the shirts to choose from,
and he can reach his pants.
His shorts are right there.
A lot of these are from last
year that will still fit him,
and then he has these cute
shark pair from Walmart,
and then these cute ones
from Old Navy that are new.
And then Calvin's is the same thing.
He has this little drawer,
his shorts are on the side,
he has jammies, he's got socks,
and he has his underwear,
not very many. (chuckles)
'Cause they're all in the washer!
And then he has his pants up here,
and then all of his clothes.
I've really liked this
setup with both of the boys,
and I don't know, maybe
they have a lot of clothes.
I don't want to say this
and be like, they have tons!
I feel like they don't have,
like, tons, tons of clothes.
I just like to have, like,
Jackson's winter clothes,
these are most, you see
them on them all the time.
They have like a handful of sweaters,
and then he outgrows
them, they go to Calvin
for next winter.
Or he has a few that
he wears all the time,
and ends up wearing them out like crazy,
and then we donate them.
So maybe they do, I don't know!
I feel like this is a good amount,
like if they had any more clothes,
I would be overwhelmed.
But this is their closet.
How do you like it?
You get dressed by yourself
everyday, huh, mister?
He's trying to, (gasps)
that was a good one!
- (chuckles) Thank you.
It is magic.
-  Whoa! (chuckles)
You need to hang out with
the Ballinger family.
They do lots of magic.
-  Yep.
-  I love having
this shelf kind of empty,
well, it's obviously full,
but empty just to put
whatever we want, like
their knick-knacks on.
Jackson's rocks.
And these pictures were
painted of the kids,
I so badly want to get them framed,
and have them right here, and then just
like their knick-knacks right there.
My goal not only is to get a car seat,
but eventually get a actual
bookshelf for the boys,
'cause, as you can see, their
books have gone in here,
but it's really small,
it's not like a bookshelf.
So that's something that
is on my list of ideas
when I go into town.
- (sighs) I feel like the weather's
playing games with my heart.
One day, the weather's
amazing, it's spring outside,
we're outside riding
bikes and playing games
and having fun and running
and picking up poop
with the shovels, and everything is great.
And then the next day, it's snowing.
This morning we actually had
about two or three inches,
and then it all melted away.
And now it's snowing again.
This is literally the weather in Utah.
There was two inches of snow.
Then around lunchtime, it melted.
And now it is, oh I don't
know, let's see, 4:00.
And it is now snowing again.
So if you're not happy with the weather,
just wait five minutes.
And that's like a life principle.
Just embrace things.
Just take things as they come.
And Jared, I'm talking to
you when I'm saying that.
Yes, I'm talking to myself. (laughs)
I just, I need to stop having expectations
and just embrace it, 'kay,
enjoy the weather as it is.
Okay, I can do it.
-  If you catch this one, we eat
chocolate chip cookies.
If you don't catch it, we eat broccoli.
- Okay.
-  Better catch it.
- 'Kay!
-  Agh!
-  Broccoli time!
(laughs)
- 'Kay.
-  What!
- I get a cookie, I get
a cookie, I get a cookie!
-  (laughs) Hi, guys!
- You have a cookie.
- I have a cookie!
- So, it's snowing.
-  Mm-hmm.
- And I'm not going to drive the canyon.
So we'll get a car seat another day.
-  It sounds like we're gonna have
broccoli tonight, Jackson.
- No.
-  Yeah buddy!
-  Agh!
- Oh!
That's my boy!
- I get a cookie.
(Ellie and Jared laugh)
Do this.
-  Now he's happy.
- Now catch it.
-  'Kay.
- Don't not catch it.
'Cause I don't want to
eat broccoli for dinner.
(Jared chuckles)
Catch it.
-  'Kay.
-  Agh!
-  Aw!
That was a bad throw, Mom.
Jackson, that was not your fault.
Mom gave you a bad throw.
Redo, I'm calling a redo.
I'm the referee, and I'm calling a redo.
- Calvin, every time we film
he's out of the room today.
-  Yeah, he just ran away.
- You guys just won't see him today.
Here, catch.
-  'Kay.
- Eye on the ball.
(Jared chuckles)
You didn't even try to catch it!
-  You made me flinch.
- Get your eye on the ball.
Woo!
-  Hey!
- I get a cookie!
(Ellie and Jared laugh)
-  What are you looking for?
- My red plate.
-  Your red plate?
It might be dirty.
What do you need it for?
- I want my red plate.
-  What are you
gonna put on your red plate?
-  Um...
One tiny cookie.
-  A cookie?
(Calvin vocalizing)
So Calvin thinks that he
doesn't need to catch a football
or anything to get a cookie, let's see.
This is all dirty, bud.
Let's close it up, 'kay?
-  My red plate.
Get my red plate.
-  You want your red plate?
Should we get it?
Should we wash it?
Actually maybe, no it's
dirty, let's wash it, 'kay?
- Okay.
-  Here's the plate.
Put a little bit of soap on it.
Good, perfect, great.
And we use the washcloth.
Get the washcloth wet.
♪ And we'll make some suds ♪
♪ We will make some suds, yeah ♪
♪ Singing my cleaning song ♪
♪ Singing my cleaning song ♪
♪ I hope you sing along ♪
♪ Singing my cleaning song ♪
Okay, I just washed it.
Now you dry it.
-  Okay.
-  You drying it?
- Yes.
-  Good.
Is it dry?
- Yes, it's dry.
-  Okay, what do you
want to put on the plate?
- Um, the tiny cookie on the plate.
-  A tiny cookie on the plate?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- But you didn't catch a ball.
-  I told him that.
He said, "I don't care."
- Of course he did.
He probably flipped you off,
too, that's Calvin's attitude.
(both laugh)
-  Um, Calvin, I
don't see any tiny cookies.
I just see big cookies.
- No, tiny, tiny cookies.
-  We can break it apart!
-  That's a great idea.
-  No thanks!
-  No, no, a big one?
- No, tiny please.
- We'll find the tiniest one.
-  Okay.
Mmm-mmm-mmm, oop!
That's the tiniest one.
- Not this kind.
I want these.
- Is he just going for
the chocolate chips?
Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Good.
Do you want some milk?
Okay. (softly chuckles)
You can't have a cookie without milk.
(pleasant music)
And just like that, not one hour later,
all of that snow is gone and melted.
Ellie, I think you are exactly right.
The weather is all over the
place, just like your hormones.
I mean, I didn't mean to say that.
- (chuckles)
Why would you say that?!
No, it--
- Your hormones are just right, Ellie.
- It is true, though.
I think I've had a harder time mentally.
-  Yeah.
- This time around.
-  I want to
give these to someone.
- You (chuckling), oh my.
-  Aww.
- Who are you gonna give them to?
- Cody and Bennett.
-  Aww.
- Are those your friends?
Your neighbor friends?
-  How sweet is that?
-  I'm gonna give them to them.
- Jackson, that's like the nicest thing.
Holy crap.
-  I wanna do that.
- 'Kay, you hold them and we'll give them
to your friends, okay?
- 'Kay, I will just knock on the door
and see if they like them.
- Aww, okay.
- This one's for Bennett,
and this one's for Cody.
- 'Kay, go get your shoes on.
- Are we doing this right now?
- I guess we're doing it.
- I guess we're doing this.
- I'm not gonna say no.
- Yeah, seriously.
- We made cookies, and he
said, "Can I give these
"to my friends?"
And usually, I'm always
like, "Yeah, yeah."
But it was downpour snowing.
- Snowing, yeah it was snowing like crazy.
- And I said, "No we're just, not gonna."
That was really cute.
- That was cute.
'Kay, hey, I guess we're
going to the neighbor's house.
Let's go.
-  'Kay.
- He just told Calvin to go under,
and then as soon as Calvin got under,
he opened it to come out.
- 'Kay, look at Mom.
I'm gonna watch you.
I don't want you to go inside and play.
You just knock on the door and say,
"Hi, I wanna give this to Bennett."
And then you leave, you don't
go in the house to play.
-  'Kay.
-  'Kay, and I'm gonna watch you
and make sure you listen, okay?
- Okay.
So Calvin's not coming.
-  Well, Calvin looks
like he wants to come with you.
Can you walk with him?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go to
Bennett's house first.
-  Okay, I'll watch ya.
-  Let's go.
- (laughs)
He found toys to go give to his friend.
-  That's so sweet.
- I wanna show you guys one last thing.
I kind of wanted today's
video to be a little bit
more about like organization.
Not that I did organization,
just kinda showed you
what we're kind of doing and planning.
We recently, Jared had
hung this up that he got
from Lowe's that has our mop and vacuum on
that I really love, 'cause
it used to be on the floor.
But my whole pantry looks so different
than what it was, and Jackson walked in,
Bonnie walked in, and they're like,
"What?! It's so different!"
So I finally got around to organizing!
And I am so happy with it.
Our pantry is really big, and
so it's not all just food.
So up here, I have my bread bowl,
and I have my Ziploc bags up here.
These all came from Big
Lots, and this is like
the kid's craft stuff
that I don't really want
them getting into, and so
it's more like I have them
in here, and then I get them
out for them to play with.
'Cause the puzzles would
be, they would never play
with the puzzles if all of the
puzzles were mixed together,
so puzzles are in a box, crayons, markers,
those are more puzzles,
Play-Doh, paper, scissors,
and Jackson's preschool
craft books are all in there.
I find a lot of his
preschool stuff on Amazon,
like I just search preschool books,
and a ton of cool stuff comes up.
So that's where that is, this
shelf is usually fairly empty.
And then this is just like my mop
and my cleaning bucket with my stuff.
So that is that side.
These are amazing.
Again, we got these at Big
Lots, these have drinks in them.
This is our fruit, this is
like pasta and cooking stuff.
This is like all of our rice,
and granola, chocolate chips.
And these are just like extra
cans that I have on hand.
It's always nice to
have some cans of food.
Marshmallow stuff, our treats are up here,
we've got bread, straws,
breakfast, snack stuff,
crackers, and then of course like cereal,
and like graham crackers
and Goldfish are in those,
and then our oatmeal.
And then down here, I love
having a stool in here,
and these are Gathre
mats that I really liked
having my flour and sugar in here.
What are you doing? (laughs)
- What is it even made out of?
This is like the most amazing thing.
-  I thought it
was Calvin crawling in.
Jared's playing with the kinetic sand.
And then I have another little thing of
like flour and sugar
that I eventually want
to get in there.
This has been, like, a
fun thing for me to do
is just kind of like,
(sighs) just do this.
Yeah, it feels good to
have this looking better
and having it more organized.
So that is like some of
the spring cleaning stuff
that I have been doing.
I would love to know what your guys'
spring cleaning goals are.
I think that's about it for the house.
You mad, Jackson?
Or are you happy?
'Kay, he's happy.
Good grief, I thought you were gonna.
-  I'm inching my way back.
-  I dig this with my head.
(Jared laughs)
-  Oh wow!
That is it for my spring cleaning.
The last and final
thing we really wanna do
is just finish up the baby's
room and put some shelves up.
Should we do that today?
- Oh, um, we could try.
- We tried last night, and
we got a little frustrated.
(laughs)
Kids, we want you to go
downstairs so Daddy and I
can play with the sand.
-  Yeah, we wanna
play with the sand.
-  So why don't you guys go play.
-  Look, there's my face.
(chuckling) Do you see my face?
That's my nose.
So we're gonna go play with kinetic sand,
and that is our day today.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
If you enjoyed it, be sure
to give it a big thumbs up,
and we will see you guys next time.
Bye.
