- We are here at the world's
largest baby shower!
Are you ready to have three kids?!
It's beautiful!
Alright our bed is made
for Bonnie and Joel.
(Laughter)
Our bag is crazy jam-packed.
And we are ready!
The kids are still asleep,
it's pretty early in the morning.
- That's a miracle. (Ellie laughs)
- They've been doing so awesome.
-  Yes they have.
- And we are getting
ready to catch a flight.
We are gonna be gone for...
One day!
- Less than 24 hours.
- We're going to...
- San Francisco!!
(light pop music)
What is your favorite thing
to do on long drives?
Like, what do you do
to pass the time?
- I like when we sing.
- Uh huh.
I was just going to say,
I know for a fact that when you're
in the car by yourself,
you crank up the music
- Oh yeah, I rock out
- and you sing your heart out
- The sunroof's open and I rock out,
Why? Do you see me?
- No I get in the car afterwards
and the music is like
turned up to a hundred.
- Yeah, 'cause if it's just me
and I don't have to
worry about kid's ears,
I just turn it up.
- And it's like 'Sorry, not sorry!'
- No that is exactly what I do.
'Yeah, yeah!' (Laughs)
- I like to listen to music.
I like to listen to motivational books
and sometimes I just like
to sit in silence.
- Yeah.
And I like to look around
not while I'm driving--
- Welcome to San Francisco!
- And we do not have
even one minute to waste.
- Not one minute.
So we are here for
the world's largest baby shower.
For you!
For you, Ellie!
And we're gonna learn so much there.
But that's not until later tonight!
So we've got a couple hours
to get a lot of things
done in San Francisco.
We've got sights to see,
places to be, bikes to ride.
- We have enough time
to go to the Golden Gate Bridge,
ride our bike, see the water,
ride it back,
maybe grab dinner, hopefully.
We should, or I'll be hangry.
And then go to this
awesome convention.
- The event.
- I'm so excited!
- We are trying to limit
the hangriness on this trip
as much as humanly possible.
- I grabbed us a few M&Ms
to hold us by.
- Okay, let's go and explore the city!
I love you.
- And it's warm!
- It's so warm here.
(light pop music)
-  Are you ready for this?
- Yes!
I'm all fashioned up!
-  Yeah!
- Ready for my bike ride.
Ready to go, boyfriend?
- Let's go, girlfriend!
-  Look at the houses!
Jared!
- Look at that!
-  Look at all
those doggies out there!
Look at that!
Holy crap,
our legs are on fire
but isn't that beautiful?
(light pop music)
- We made it to the Golden Gate Bridge!
- It's beautiful!
- And now we gotta go home!
Back to the hotel.
Apparently this is how
you beat the traffic.
You just get a tiny car!
Is everything tiny in San Franciso?
- We're ready!
- Hi pregnant mommy!
- Are you ready to have three kids?
- Oh my goodness,
I don't even believe it.
- It still doesn't feel real.
- I don't believe it.
- He's been moving all day.
- I know, you've been saying like
(gasps) Oh!
Ooh! Ooh!
- You're gonna film it
soon! (Jared laughs)
Even more!
- So today has worked out
perfectly to a tee.
We got off the airplane,
raced to our hotel,
raced to the Golden Gate Bridge area
like the Lombard Street,
or wherever.
Rented bikes, biked there
and then we came back
and everyone was saying that
traffic was gonna take us
an hour and a half
so we were booking it.
But we got everything
done that we wanted to
before this event that we're going to
and we had enough time to even
freshen up a little bit
and these are the outfits of the day.
What do you think?
-  I'm peeing!
- I'm glad.
Enjoy yourself.
- We are here at
the world's largest baby shower!
They have so many products,
a little bit of tech
that I cannot wait to go and see.
- One of the things that I missed
at CES was all of the
home and baby tech stuff.
- I was so sad!
- I know, I was sad too,
so I'm glad we're here
so we can see some of this
really, really cool stuff.
- You are not walking fast enough!
- Ellie is so excited
to see everything here.
I cannot keep up.
- It's the bassinet.
- The bassinets.
Oh but it's the strollers,
- That's the one thing
I really want.
- but it's the car seats.
- Well strollers are cool
but I want to look at the bassinets.
(light techno music)
I have a Tula at home
which I love the wrap.
I have a Tula and a Ergo
and I like the Tulas a lot.
I have never had uh,
a high chair.
Do you wanna go look at the high chairs?
-  Yeah!
What's crazy to me is that
so we've been parents for what,
four years now?
And even in four years,
the baby tech game
like, the baby game
has changed so much.
This is a car seat
that folds into a stroller.
Oh wait!
Is it a stroller
that folds into a car seat?
Look at that!
Isn't that so cool?
I think this is new from them.
- But these are cool!
- This looks cool.
- I like that,
I like the white one.
How cute would that be?
-  The target ends on the--
-  Whaaat??!
How does that work?
- It's magnetic.
-  Ellie, that's magic!
-  We can put it
a little more in the middle
so it's a little bit more magnetic.
Super easy to put back.
-  Babe's got it!
(Ellie Laughs)
- That's amazing.
I found you. (Laughs)
Oh wow,
so you can grab the baby
is that what that is?
- Yeah, it's just right
It's easier by your bed.
- Yeah.
(light techno music)
Just in case you forgot,
(Ellie laughs)
It's a Boy!
That's so sweet.
We were getting ready
to meet with a pediatrician,
awesome scientist,
CMO of so many things.
- I am so excited to talk to her.
We've been talking to
her for like an hour.
And she's like willing to
come do videos with us,
like for education.
There she is right now!
- There she comes now!
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
Doctor Swanson!
- This is so exciting!
How cute she's been to us.
I love this!
- So we're here at
this big event with Spoonful One
and Spoonful One is a company that creates
a mix-in for food
that helps introduce your babies
to potential allergens and
helps with all of that.
And we're meeting with
Dr. Swanson to talk about
food allergies and everything.
So I wanted to ask a
first question to you:
- Sure.
- What exactly is a food allergy?
- Well, a food allergy is
a complex interaction
that your body's having where
it's really not reacting
in the way that we expect.
So when you don't have a food allergy
you put food in your body,
your body breaks it down,
takes the energy from it
and it goes fine.
When you've got a food allergy,
your immune system does something
where it overreacts
or it's kind of agitated in a way.
And it sets off on a cascade of reactions
where you can have skin rash,
you can sometimes have tummy ache,
you can have vomiting,
you can have hives,
and of course sometime with food allergies
you can have a life-threatening condition
called anaphylaxis.
- We don't have a history of it,
my kids don't have it,
can they develop it?
- Anyone can develop a food allergy.
- Later on?
- That's the scary part.
Yeah, I mean you and I
could still develop a food allergy.
Now, if we eat a really diverse diet
and we keep exposing ourselves,
it's unlikely that our immune
system will kinda go haywire.
But hereditary, in the
genome itself is not,
I can't point to it and say
'That's the problem,'
'that's what causes food allergies.'
In fact, you know,
65% of kids who have a food allergy
don't have family member who does.
- Can you protect my
baby from food allergies?
- Well new science is changing
how we understand that.
We know that breastfeeding is best
and formula feeding is great too,
but it isn't protective.
Breastfeeding isn't protective
against food allergies.
The best thing that we know
that you can do now is getting high
or potential allergenic
foods in early and often.
If you feed em right away,
you don't wait a long time,
you can try a new food every day.
And then it's not one and done.
I mean it's really,
you introduce peanut
- You keep--
- You keep doing it.
You want to give babies
all sorts of diverse
foods every single day
so their immune system is just
growing up with peanut,
growing up with avocado,
growing up with wheat,
growing up with soy,
- I love it.
- Growing up with anything
that they get used to.
So they don't trigger
an immune dysfunction
that would cause them
to overreact to that later.
The AAAAI which is
this big asthma, allergy,
and immunology academy says
right when you start feeding solid foods
at four to six months of age,
we want you to start with--
- Introducing--
- All the potential allergens right away.
- Hey!
- And I'm saying
I don't want you to take your time
and take six months to get through them.
I'm saying, get it done!
- Start it.
- You can start a food on Monday,
the next day,
- That's interesting.
- You can start another one.
And in some ways that's
where Spoonful One comes in.
What we do know
is there was a second study
called the Eats study.
And what the Eats study did
is took breastfed babies
and it gave them five of these
higher allergy foods
or potential allergen.
Gave them to them on a regular basis.
And it was hard for families
to get all five of those
foods in every day, right?
- Yeah.
- In the families that were able
to give their babies those foods regularly
they were much less likely
to have a food allergy.
- What are the common
foods that cause problems?
We hear so much about peanuts,
anything else we should think about?
- Well we do think about peanut
because it's the most common in kids.
But 75% of people who
have a food allergy
have an allergy that is something
other than peanut.
'Cause they have peanut and
or they have something else.
So we think about tree nuts,
so pistachios and walnuts
and things like that.
We of course think about fish
so regular fish that swim in the ocean
and shellfish and then we think about
things that are really
common in the American diet.
So things like milk,
so that dairy product.
Or we think about soy, wheat, and egg.
- Awesome.
A huge thanks to Dr. Swanson!
And my new friend for helping me
answer some questions
and hopefully giving you
guys some information.
I know that I learned a lot today
and not even just learned a lot
but just felt reassured
about what I'm doing
with my own kids at my own home.
We're gonna have a link to Spoonful One
in our description.
- This is for anyone who wants to really
kind of, decrease that risk of
developing food allergies later on.
- Perfect.
- That's spoonfulone.com
- Thank you so much!
I have loved everything about this night.
I have loved looking at baby product
after baby product,
after baby product!
- It was so much fun and--
- I've been giddy,
I loved--
I'm sorry I interrupted you.
- It's okay.
- I loved the presentations
by the pediatricians
and the doctors.
I loved hearing what
they had to say.
- It just adds another
excitement level for us
being pregnant and having another baby.
- Only like,
a handful more months, guys.
- Oh my gosh.
- We're about halfway there.
- That's so crazy.
- A huge thank you to Spoonful One
for sponsoring today's video.
I've loved getting to know you guys,
I've loved talking to you guys.
I think it's really important that
we talk about food allergies.
I'm grateful for our platform
and that we can share this with you.
We're gonna go grab a little bite to eat.
- Ooh, sounds delicious!
- Where do we go
in San Francisco?
- I don't know!
That's the thing,
there's so many restaurants
we couldn't pick one!
We couldn't.
Could you imagine walking
outside like this?
In Utah right now?
- It would be freezing!
- It feels so good outside
and it's 10 P.M.
- It's beautiful.
- I've loved San Francisco
it's been great.
We've only been here for what,
12 hours tops?
Not even 12 hours.
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, and we love it here.
We should definitely come back.
When we have more than 12 hours.
- Ahh!
So much baby information,
so exciting!
We're gonna go to bed.
Good night my baby baby boy!
Good night!
Bye, guys.
