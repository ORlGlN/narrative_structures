- Today is August 11th, 2017,
and we have something exciting
that we wanna share with you.
Ellie, why don't you
tell us what that says?
- It says we're pregnant!
- We're pregnant!
- We are very excited.
Jared and I are having a baby.
For all of you that have
followed Jared and I,
you know that we've been
trying to have a baby,
and we had a miscarriage a few months ago,
and I am very irregular,
and I've been keeping track,
and I had a period on June 30th,
and I ovulated on July 30th,
and that would leave me right
now 12 days past ovulation,
and it was just really
early to take a test.
A few days ago, I took a test,
because I just felt a
little off, and I felt like
my boobs were a little
fuller, and we got a very,
very faint positive, and we're like,
"Oh my gosh, that's crazy".
You can barely see it, and
then, yesterday, we took a test,
and you can definitely see the line there,
and, today, 12 days past
ovulation, I got a positive
pregnancy test again.
- Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
- Jared and I are very excited.
Here, in a few days, we have
our first doctor appointment,
and, in four weeks, we
have our first ultrasound.
We'll keep you updated
day by day as I'm feeling,
and what's going on.
Well, good morning, family.
Today is the day.
We have an ultrasound today.
- I'm so excited.
- I'm gonna order pancakes!
- And we are going to go to
breakfast with the family.
I thought that would be fun
to start our morning off.
We're gonna have breakfast.
-  I wanna order pancakes!
- We're gonna order pancakes,
and then we are gonna go
to my ultrasound.
- To your ultrasound!
- I'm very excited.
Have a little bit of nerves,
but I'm very excited.
We have been on cloud 10 for
days, and I keep taking a test,
'cause I just don't
believe it, and, every time
it shows up positive, I
just can't even believe it.
- It's been exciting.
It's so great.
- And, with that, I don't sleep,
and I think it's just 'cause I'm excited.
I wake up all night just
like, "I can't believe this".
This is so unreal, and
my eyes are tired, and--
- Every night, when we
go to bed, Ellie's like,
"Can you even believe this".
Isn't this crazy?
- I am so happy, and I
am looking like crazy
on Pinterest right now.
I am showing Jared there's a
bunch of photos, of course,
I wanna take while I'm
expecting, but look at this.
I think it'd be so pretty
to do something like this
where it's like a silhouette, you know,
every few weeks or every
trimester or something.
(gentle music)
With every pregnancy, I
have got this massage bar
for my tummy from Lush,
and the whole nine months
it lasts me, and I rub
it on my belly every day
and even, towards the end of the pregnancy
when my belly is stretched
and tired and it hurts,
I rub it on it more than once a day,
and it lasts the whole nine months.
I feel really good.
I think I'm tired just because
I've been really excited,
and I haven't slept, but I
can tell around three o'clock,
I'm just kind of done for the day.
My eyes are so tired, and I'm hungry.
Right when I wake up, if I
do not eat, I'm just like,
"I need to eat, or I'm gonna be cranky".
Those are just two things that
I definitely have noticed,
but it still boggles my mind.
I take a test every morning,
because I just don't think that it's real,
and I just don't know what to do all day.
This is what my face just looks like.
I'm excited.
I am a little nervous.
I think that, with every pregnancy,
I have been a little nervous.
It's always in the back
of my mind of what ifs,
and you just really
never know until you have
that healthy baby in your
arms, but I'm excited,
and I'm going to be excited right now,
and I am a little nervous for
our appointments coming up,
but I'm just gonna try and
enjoy the moment as it's here,
and I hope and pray that
everything goes safe and good.
I have a really good
feeling, though, about it,
and I think that that says a lot for me
if I feel really good and at peace.
- My heart just starts pounding,
and my hearts starts racing,
and I get a little nervous,
and I can't even imagine
how you feel, Ellie.
- I have a lot of nerves right now.
(music drowns out speech)
- I do this, and it turns on.
- Okay.
I'm sitting here, and I
just got the house cleaned.
Everyone took naps today, feeling great,
and I'm just going, looking
up Fall and Christmas decor,
'cause I am just kind of obsessed
thinking about Fall decor
right now, and I got a
phone call and a voicemail
from my doctor, so, when I called to go in
for my first appointment,
they just did blood work,
and I asked them if I
could get on Progesterone,
because, if you get on
Progesterone, from what I was told
having Jackson is it doesn't
hurt you just to get on it,
'cause it just can help
prevent miscarriage
is what the fertility doctors had told me,
and, with having a
miscarriage a few months ago,
calling in, I asked them.
I said, "Can we, um,
get me on Progesterone,"
and she's like, "Well,
I talked to the doctor,
"and we'll check your
levels, and, if they're low,
"then we'll give it to
you," and I just got a call
from the doctor, which I love
when the doctor himself calls.
I'm gonna try not to get emotional,
but it just means a lot to me.
It just means a lot to me
when they personally call,
and he just left a
really heartfelt message,
and he said it's nothing to worry about,
but he said that my Progesterone
is a little borderline,
and he said hopefully that makes sense.
I'm like, (laughs) I think I get it,
but it was kinda funny how he said it.
Anyway, so they called
me in a prescription,
so, Jared, I was like, "Run".
My heart just sank, and
I'm just like, "No".
He's gonna go get me some Progesterone,
and I'm gonna be on that
until the first trimester
is over with to give me a little boost,
and I'm really hoping that
everything will be good.
You know, it's just always
in the back of your mind,
like scare and fear, and I've
really enjoyed the last week
just kind of in our own element,
just Jared and I knowing
and just enjoying it and
thinking about a pregnancy
and just enjoying it
for myself for a minute,
and that does worry me a little bit,
but I still feel really
good and really positive,
but it's just one of those
things along the way.
You know, you spot a little
bit, and you get really nervous
or your Progesterone's low,
and you get a little nervous,
which I think you should.
You know, it's like that's your baby,
and you want everything to go smooth.
Jared is on his way to
go get the medicine,
and I'll keep you guys updated.
Hopefully, everything will
continue to go smooth.
-  This is it.
This is it, boys.
Look, when the doctor comes in, Jackson,
we'll be able to look up on this TV,
and we're gonna see if we
can find the baby, okay?
- I can't see.
-  Is that exciting?
-  I'm gonna move this chair.
-  Okay, do you
wanna see the TV better?
- We just had the cutest moment.
Jared and I--
- Oh, so sweet.
- Were not gonna tell Jackson yet.
We were gonna wait until
we have our ultrasound,
and we were gonna--
- And show him the picture and everything.
- Yeah, or bring him with us,
and I just went to the bathroom,
and I was like looking at my
tummy, and I was showing Jared,
and, Jackson, did you
find something out tonight
about my tummy?
- Yeah, a baby.
-  And you said,
"Mom, is there a baby
"in your tummy".
- Yeah.
-  And what is the baby doing?
- Growing.
-  Yeah, and you
found out tonight, huh?
- You figured it out, and that's the thing
is he figured it out.
-  It's funny.
- Ellie was just like,
"Jared, look at my tummy,"
and he says, "Is there
a baby in your tummy".
It was the cutest thing in the world.
-  You can tell
your brother tomorrow, huh?
-  Should you tell Calvin?
- Yes.
-  And I asked you
do you think we'll have
a brother or a sister?
- A brother.
-  Brother.
K, that changed from two
seconds ago, so we'll see.
-  He said sister before.
-  K, it's time for bed.
-  K, do you guys have your spot?
You guys ready to see
when the doctor comes in?
(laughs)
- Sit here.
I sit here.
- I am getting ready to
go out for the night,
and I am nervous.
I'm nervous, 'cause I'm worried that
I'm gonna be sick driving home.
I have been very sick at night.
I don't have morning sickness.
I totally have night sickness,
which is so weird for me,
because I've never really had sickness
when I've been pregnant.
Of course, there's been a
few days where it's like
I don't feel good and
maybe a little nausea,
but I've never been like,
"I need to lay down.
"I'm nauseated," you know,
but the last few nights
have been so bad.
Last night was so, so bad.
I had Jared put a bowl next to my bed
just in case I woke up
and needed to throw up,
and tonight I'm going out, and we'll see.
Hopefully, I can make it home okay.
(gentle music)
- It's okay, baby.
It's okay, baby.
-  Are you saying,
"It's okay, baby"?
- Okay, baby!
- Jackson is saying, "It's okay, baby,"
'cause I was pushing him,
and he was pretending
to kick me, and I'd go aw, and he'd laugh,
and then, after a minute, he
goes, "Where's your baby,"
and I said, "In my tummy," and he said,
"I don't wanna hurt the
baby," so now he's saying.
What are you saying?
- It's okay, baby.
- It's okay, baby.
- It's okay, baby.
-  And then you
stopped pretending to kick
so you wouldn't kick the baby.
I thought that was so sweet of you.
-  You ready for this?
- Yes.
-  All right, only
been waiting five days.
- Hopefully I'm far
along to see on this one.
-  The external, yeah.
- I'm eight weeks and four days, I think.
-  K.
-  I'm about to
say we can't see from above
when you're teeny tiny.
- Yeah, push hard.
-  Look up at the TV, k.
Look up right there.
-  Yeah, it looks
like it's too little.
-  Where's the baby?
-  Dang it.
-  Too little, k.
-  Here's the gray part.
-  Yes, that's the baby.
-  There's the sac.
-  Okay.
-  And I just can't see it now.
-  Dad, where's the baby?
-  We might have to
use a different ultrasound
to see the baby.
(mumbles)
-  I never would
say to look in the vaginal.
I have a little concern
right, like, to me,
that's a little bit irregular.
- What does that mean?
-  Not as big as it should be.
- And this is why I was
nervous to have the kids come
if something didn't go right,
'cause he was just like, "What".
-  Where's the baby?
- Jackson, we're gonna make sure
that there is a healthy baby.
- I think he's basing it off
of their measurements, not--
-  Ours.
- Ours, so I think two
weeks is a big difference
when this baby's that little.
I know you didn't want to, but
we've gotta go the other way.
-  I have a little anxiety.
What's that big gray on the left?
-  This right here?
-  Yeah.
-  Is a little
cyst on your right ovary.
That's probably a little bit of blood.
This is the sac.
-  Baby.
(whispers)
- It grows probably to the
point three weeks, four weeks--
- And then stops.
- Then it stops, but, if it
forms on a separate organ,
then it keeps going.
The sac grows, but it's empty.
It's not really empty. (audio distortion)
(somber music)
- As you guys can probably
tell from the video,
the baby stopped growing,
and we are going to miscarry,
but we had one, exactly one month
of the most enjoyable month together.
We had this--
- Yes.
- To ourselves, and we've
never done that before,
and it was special, and it was nice,
and we really enjoyed it.
- Jared summed it up perfect.
He was like, "This month has been bliss,"
and I am so glad that we
continued to document it though,
and I have so many cute pictures
of my itty bitty teeny belly.
I gained four pounds,
and this was a fun month,
and we, in our Q&A,
I had said Jared and I, with
us filming for four years,
we're learning what to do and not to do,
and, especially when it
comes to raw emotions,
it's very important that
we keep things and enjoy it
and grieve and do that on our timing,
and we've been open to
each other and to you guys
that, if good and bad, we would announce,
and today we were gonna
announce good or bad,
and, unfortunately, it
doesn't end very well,
but we did have a wonderful month.
- We really did,
There's trials in life, and
we go through these trials,
and I've always said the
trials you go through
don't define you.
It's how you overcome those trials,
and we're gonna keep going forward,
and we are going to feel the sad emotion.
- Oh, yes.
- We are going to feel
that, and we are going to go
through this process,
but that doesn't mean
we're not gonna keep our chins
up and our heads forward.
Ellie tweeted the other day
having a positive attitude
doesn't mean that you can't be sad,
but it's being able to
recognize that there's gonna be
better days ahead.
- Well, and just because you're positive
doesn't mean you're always happy.
We're just looking at a bright side,
and tomorrow's a new day,
but I am gonna allow myself
to be sad and grieve--
- Absolutely.
- And I do have two
beautiful, healthy boys,
and I did get pregnant on my own,
and that all alone, in and
of itself, is a blessing,
and I see that, but
I'm still gonna grieve,
and I'm gonna be very sad, and I am sad,
and it was amazing.
I took so many tests this month.
-  All of those are positive.
- So many tests this
month, and it was amazing,
and I took one just two weeks ago
just 'cause I couldn't even believe it.
I think I'm mostly sad 'cause of Jackson.
We weren't gonna tell him.
- He figured it out.
- And it's kinda hard not
to, and he did figure it out,
and he's been the cutest to me.
- Always asking about how's the baby,
and it was just really sweet.
- He was very tender.
- And it just goes to show
what kind of person he is,
and we are so, so grateful
for Jackson and Calvin.
We are so grateful for them
and the love that we have
for them and the love they have for us.
I mean, we're grateful for them.
- Oh yeah, we just stared at them today
and just stared all day, and we're like,
"What should we do?
Whatever you want, kids".
It was a day to spend with family,
but we're gonna go ahead and
say goodnight to you guys.
I thoroughly enjoyed all my conversations
with our family today.
I'm so grateful that we
have them to lean on.
- Absolutely.
- Thank you guys for
supporting us and coming along
this crazy life, and I know
a lot of you have experienced
this too, and we're just sharing
our little bits of journey,
so thank you for watching.
- And we'll see you guys next time.
Bye.
- Bye.
