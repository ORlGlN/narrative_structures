- Good morning guys.
Before the vlog starts,
we have a very special announcement
that we want to make.
In fact, we all have a
very special announcement
we want to make.
Ellie, take it away.
- A year in the making,
we are so excited to announce
that we have a custom clothing line.
- Bollie!
- Bollie!
- Bollie!
- Bolliebrand.com is up and running,
our custom clothing line, Bonnie.
This has been so fun.
We have all gotten together
1,000 times this year.
- It has been work work work work work.
- Non-stop fun and work.
- Non-stop.
- It has been amazing.
We will have our video
that Bonnie and I just filmed
in the description about Bollie
and we'll have bolliebrand.com,
our website, in the description.
- Go check it out.
- This has been an amazing journey
and it's just the beginning.
(signal tone)
(popping)
- I swear I'm funnier in real life
than on the vlogs.
This is the ultimate bath bomb.
Lush, take a note.
(yelling)
(bright music)
Yeah!
- That looks awesome!
- Doesn't that look so good?
(Penny barking)
Listen, I know, okay?
These things have been in the closet
for some time now.
It's been a long time coming.
I'm going to clean through my bins.
You're sitting on my bins.
These are your bins.
You've got some bins to go through too.
Or have you already done it?
- I did it.
-  You did it.
You took these two bins
and put 'em in there?
- And in here.
-  And there, aww cute.
- Keeping those.
- Keeping those, you bet you are.
So here's the thing,
when I go through old stuff,
I never sort through it and clean it,
I just reminisce.
That's what I do, and I'm like oh--
- That's usually what you should do.
- Yeah you do, but then
instead of a 15, 20 minute job,
it turns into a two hour job.
And we don't have two hours to spend,
to do this, you know what I mean?
- Mmm-hmm, but we're doing it.
- We're doing it right now.
And in the meantime, if feel like
we might show you a couple things,
so you can reminisce with us.
We'll do a little split.
- In the back of my underwear drawer,
(Jared laughs)
these are the tests from baby,
which like look at my tummy today.
-  I know, you have popped,
like your belly has popped.
- I feel like it has.
Bonnie told me the other day,
she's like you look really pregnant.
And I feel like I do.
-  You do look pregnant,
I'm glad you look it.
- So I will keep one.
- I won't keep all, I'll keep one.
- What if you taped them together
and had one mega pregnancy test?
I swear I'm funnier in real life
than on the vlog.
-  You are.
- You might not think I'm
funny on the vlogs at all,
but I'm funny and I'm
not afraid to admit it.
Ellie was just like,
okay, this is my plan.
In this box up here--
- These are my nicknacks
and this is my letters.
- Yeah and I was like well don't forget
that you have some patty
wacks that you need
to include there too.
- And it was funny.
- It was funny.
Everyone is just like oh gross Jared,
that was a terrible joke,
but in the moment, it was funny.
Okay, I'm funny.
- I think it's important
when you toss something
that means a lot to you,
you should find and replicate it,
buy it again, use it,
take a picture of it,
and in our case, we're filming it.
- And then as hard as it is,
I kinda agree, this backpack
has a lot of meaning for me,
but I will never use it,
so I'm just gonna get another one.
-  Well I said
you should order one.
- Because honestly, I
think the zipper's broken.
The straps are, my dog Wrinkles
I think, got to the straps.
Or something like that.
-  Where'd you get it?
- In Finland.
-  Yeah, it looks nice.
- This is what it was, yeah I remember,
there's a giant hole in the bottom.
-  He used it
to school all the time.
- I used it in Finland
and then I used it for school.
But yeah, there's a
giant hole in the bottom,
so it's not usable, but
I'll just get another one.
- Take a picture, so we know
the brand and everything--
- Hagl√∂fs
-  Got it.
Okay last thing and
then we'll move on guys.
I made Jared a get better soon card
and then Julie, Mom, my dad, me,
and Landon all wrote on it.
-  Awww.
- Do you want me to read 'em real quick?
-  Sure just real quick.
- I said Hobble, because
we used to call each other,
I used to call you Hobble.
- And we got that bear
that was named Hobble.
- Yes, that was cute.
Roses are red, violets are blue,
if you can't chase me,
then I'll chase you.
(laughing)
Cute.
- Because I couldn't run?
- Yes.
Mom says I'll bet the nurses and doctors
just love you, you're such
a positive, happy person.
You'll heal fast because of your attitude
and I know the days
ahead will not be easy,
but you'll have a lot of grit
and you'll do just fine.
We'll see you in a couple of days, my mom.
That's so cute, ah!
Guess what we're doing today girl.
Guess what we're doing today?
We are doing what Mama likes best.
We are doing what the kids love.
We are finally making some bath bombs.
- Ready boys, follow me.
Follow me.
-  We're gonna make
something that you love.
What do you think we're gonna make?
- What the heck?
- Take a look.
- Why is there Spiderman?
-  What do you
think this looks like?
- Here's Joke.
- What is it?
- Is that the joker?
_ It's the Joker!
- What do you think that looks like?
- I don't know.
-  Like a big ball?
- We're gonna make bath bombs.
Are you guys ready to make bath bombs
with toys in it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Which toy do you choose, Cal?
- I want this one.
-  That one?
- This one.
-  And you want
Flash and Spiderman.
- Yes.
- Okay, Jackson, do you
want to do the first one?
- Yes.
- Good job, okay.
- Two cups baking soda.
- One cup--
- Corn starch.
- Corn stuff.
(laughing)
-  That was adorable.
- Why is it so funny?
-  Calvin say, one cup.
- One cup.
-  Corn starch.
- Corn stoch.
- One cup citric acid.
- On cup of delicious Epsom salt.
Oooop.
- I'm mixing all our dry
ingredients together.
The kids are occupied with the toys.
I should've given that to
them when we were ready.
- There's two main parts
to making these bath bombs.
These are like the do
it yourself versions,
there's dry ingredients
and then wet ingredients.
You mix all of the dry
ingredients together first
and then you slowly mix
in the wet ingredients,
as to not make the
chemical reaction happen
while you're making the bath bombs.
Oh no Jackson, do you have the flash mask
on Spiderman's head?
- No.
-  Thought that's what happened.
I was worried for a second.
You said his head was stuck.
You got 'em all together?
Hi, my name is Peter Parker.
Oh I'm spider man.
- Four teaspoon oil.
(laughing)
- No Calvin.
Essential oil.
- You know in our family,
we use a ton of bath bombs
so we've actually
doubled the normal recipe
that you can find online.
So more bath bombs, more fun.
- Yeah, Jared just wanted to do a handful,
I was like, no, we are doing all of them.
-  All of these.
- We're doing a teaspoon of oil.
So this is coconut oil.
I think you can use any oils,
I've even seen people using body oil, so.
-  Yeah, olive oil, almond oil,
any of those oils.
Let's say oils, say oil.
- Oil.
- Say oil.
- Oyie.
(bright music)
-  So now we're just slowly adding
the wet ingredients to
the dry ingredients.
This is our very first time,
so we're probably gonna make one mistake.
- Who wants to do the soap coloring?
- Me.
- One, two, three, four.
- Perfect.
- Okay Mom, you're kind of spilling it.
-  There we go, I
was getting a little worried
about the color, but I
think it's turning out--
- Yeah, I did a lot more than four drops.
-  It smells good,
like it just smells--
- Lavender and lemon.
-  Mmmm.
- Mmmm.
-  Does that smell good bud?
- Tastes good.
- No don't, don't taste it.
- No it doesn't.
-  Okay what's
our next color buddy?
- Green.
-  Green, alright.
-  Let's see it.
Good job, let's try that.
- Good.
- Okay Calvin, what color are you doing?
- Yellow.
-  Yellow.
-  It's kinda orange.
-  Now me!
-  Why is there a heart?
- Good job.
- Good job bud.
-  Okay we've got
blue, we've got green
and then that's kind
of an orangish yellow.
- Calvin, where's your little Lego?
Let's lay 'em all out.
-  Which one do
you want to put inside?
- I want to do Ironman.
- So this will be yours.
Okay so what I want you to do
is take this,
and scrape some blue in it.
Perfect.
You put your toy inside.
Okay now say I'll see you in the tub.
- I'll see you in the tub.
- Okay oh.
- Oh.
-  Okay, make it snap,
oh that's gonna look so cool.
- It's gonna be like a marble.
-  Alright, this one
actually looks really cool.
We're gonna put it in the freezer,
so we can have it sooner.
Usually, you'll have to let them sit
for 24 hours,
but I think in the freezer for 30 minutes
these will work.
Okay Calvin, what color are you choosing?
- Green.
-  Green.
And who's your guy?
- Spiderman.
-  Spiderman.
Green and yellow.
- Workin' it.
-  We completely underestimated.
We doubled the recipe.
- We're going to double it again,
so I can use those.
- He wants to do two superheroes.
-  Two superheroes?
Oh double trouble.
Flash and Spiderman have
become good friends today.
-  Three.
-  Three?
- And Hulk.
- And Joker.
-  And Hulk, four?
That is the ultimate bath bomb.
- I love that.
-  Lush take a note.
Alright, Calvin's is all done.
I think this one's gonna turn out
just a little bit better.
It's packed a little more.
Here we go, we'll put
it right there, awesome.
Okay, it's time for another round.
Ellie put pink all together
and we're going to fill
up as many as we can.
(lively music)
- I cannot wait to use this.
Does that look awesome?
Ah!
-  That looks so good.
-  Okay, Jackson's doing a heart.
-  Ellie, you're a star.
(lively music)
- Awesome, do another one.
-  He did that all by himself.
That's awesome.
Good job Calvin.
Pack that one.
- Now pack this one.
-  Don't close it yet,
you gotta put stuff in the other one.
Yeah, there you go.
Flip it around.
- His face.
- I know.
- You did awesome.
-  You did so good.
- Good job Calvin.
- Thanks Mom.
- You're welcome.
- Let's go put 'em in the fridge.
(lively music)
Look at all these bath bombs.
-  And ice cream.
-  Mmm, yum.
- Is grapes in water yummy mister?
I am getting dinner ready.
The kids have come up a thousand times,
can we get our bath bombs out?
And I'm like no, not until bed time.
I've got some steamed vegetables going on
and this is one of my favorite meals.
This is Hello Fresh,
it's chicken, bell pepper.
I always put pico de gallo on mine.
Jared is a little more simple
and doesn't like that, so he
just has cheese and chicken
and the kids have cheese,
so we're throwing this in the oven,
and we're getting ready to eat.
And mister is playing
with grapes and water,
so you know, whatever entertains him.
- So we had dinner and boys,
I think it's time to
check on the bath bombs.
You ready for this?
- Yeah!
-  Let's grab some.
Now here's what we're gonna do,
let's start off with these little ones,
and we're gonna test 'em out okay?
You got 'em?
- Open them up.
-  Yeah let's open up 'em.
Here, let's go over here.
Yeah, let's open 'em up and we'll see.
Oh my goodness.
- Put your hand out.
-  Yes!
We've got a bath bomb.
Wait, not yet, not yet, not yet,
we gotta get Calvin's.
- Wait for Calvin's.
-  Oh yes, the heart worked.
- The stars were hard, open your hand.
-  Yay!
- Yeah!
- What do you think?
- Let's put them in the water.
-  You want to
put them in the water?
One two three.
- Ah!
That looks awesome.
- Yeah!
- You made your own.
Good job.
- What about the toys?
-  And the toys
are in your big ones.
We'll take a bath.
-  Do you guys hear that?
-  Yeah.
- This is lavender.
You want to put the star in there Cal?
-  It looks more pink in real life
than in camera,.
In camera, it looks almost orange.
That's so funny.
- Oh.
- It smells amazing.
It feels good.
-  Good job.
- I'm impressed with the fizziness.
-  Yeah, it fizzed really good.
- I do like how Lush's foam.
That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
- This definitely fizzed more than foamed.
- But this is awesome.
Yay, we made our own.
-  Guys we did it.
Whoa.
-  Oh I broke the heart.
-  Oh no, my heart's broken.
- Okay, I do think it is best,
we froze ours for a little
bit to make it sturdy,
but next time we'll just
leave them overnight.
-  Overnight, yeah.
- Or just for a few hours.
Because they're still soft.
- This is so cool.
-  You like it?
- Yeah.
-  Awesome bud, I'm
glad you're having fun.
- How exciting that we made our own.
We're gonna make more too, okay?
-  You know what's
gonna be even more fun?
When you do this in the bath tub.
-  With your huge ones.
-  Yeah, with the toys.
Alright, let's put this in.
-  Now me!
- It smells so good, I love this smell.
Ah.
- We're gonna be doing this a lot,
because every time they
take a bath, they ask me,
-  Look!
- Do we have any bath bombs?
-  Yay.
- I'm gonna let these
just sit for a few hours.
-  Kinda get to room temperature.
- And then I'm gonna put 'em in,
I always put 'em in my dish.
and this bad boy, too bad
there's not a pearl in there.
-  Oh fail, Dad fail.
- No, it's cute.
-  I wonder if the
metal ones will break apart
easier than the plastic ones.
I mean it won't cut through.
- So we just found this online
that a lot of people use.
I was trying to find how to
make an ultimate fancy one
like with other stuff, so I
didn't really see anything
other than this, but if
you guys have made some
that you know I'd like,
because you know I love bath bombs,
please let me know,
because I want to keep doing this.
I think it would be nice,
because it's fun to do with the kids.
It took up our whole day, playing,
cleaning up, making 'em, so.
-  Yeah.
- I would love to do more of it.
- I'm gonna put my face in the water.
-  You want to put
your face in the water?
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.
- How about in the bath tub?
-  Oh right now?
Okay, Mom gave you the
approval, go for it.
Mom's giving you a bath anyway.
-  I don't know if you would do it,
we'll see, try it.
-  Do it do it do it
do it do it do it!
- He just laughs.
-  Alright, we gotta clean up now
that we made this,
actually it wasn't a big mess at all.
And it's clean stuff, so
it kinda just works out.
Nice contribution, Calvin.
Really appreciate that.
- Jackson's is done, guys.
(running water)
I am so impressed.
-  Doesn't that look so good?
That looks like it came
directly from Lush.
Let's see Calvin's.
- It's beautiful.
- Why have we not been doing this?
-  Ironman!
-  He dropped it in.
- The water is so cool.
- Wow, that's amazing.
Oh how perfect is this?
It smells so good.
Oh my gosh.
-  Why did we not do this sooner?
- This is so cool.
I definitely see it is a little soft,
so I think letting it sit for 24 hours
is the best idea,
but we wanted to do it right away,
have some fun.
It's so cool.
(Penny barking)
(Jared laughing)
-  What does she see?
-  I have no idea.
(Penny growling)
- Hey hey, it's okay, hey hey.
-  It's the clothes on the bed.
- Hey hey hey hey it's okay.
(Penny barks)
Look it's okay.
Off off off off.
- Penny, good girl.
What a good guard dog.
What, you're okay, it's okay.
- Holy crapola.
-  I know.
You okay?
You good now?
- Good girl.
- I know.
- You did good.
- As if someone was on my bed.
-  Yeah, good girl.
- That was intense.
- That was.
I'm like that's silly,
but at the same time, it's like, good.
- She saw something she didn't like.
- Yeah.
- She said usually Mom's bed's perfect.
-  Hey, you a little riled up now.
Your tail was sticking up
and your stripe on your
back was sticking up too,
I like that.
- And the thing is, she didn't even
go in there and see.
She barely walked in and then
she instantly came out, grrr.
and then went back in was like--
-  Yeah.
-  What the heck?
- Good girl, that's my girl.
It's okay, yeah see it's okay.
(Jared laughing)
What a silly dog.
Sometimes in my office,
she will bark in the
reflection of the window.
So sometimes I'm wondering,
does she see herself in the mirror?
On the nightstand?
Unless someone's under the bed.
Nope, no one's under the bed,
so I think we're in the clear.
- Alright, my final thing
about the bath bombs,
they were amazing,
I don't think I love
these stars and hearts.
Almost every single one of them
have broken in half,
but that could totally be our fault,
because we didn't let
it really really set.
So we're gonna try 'em again sometime
and let it set more,
before we try and take it apart.
This is that shell one.
If feels pretty good, but
I'm not gonna take it out
until tomorrow when I know
it's really really set,
because I want to use that bad boy.
And I'll let the kids use these
and play with those as they take baths.
That was fun.
Like I said, please please tell me
if there's other fun things
I should add in there.
Like I was like, should
I shred a real lemon
and put stuff in there, I
don't know, let me know.
But we'll see you guys next
time, thank you so much
for watching, I'm cleaning
up my mess, see ya.
