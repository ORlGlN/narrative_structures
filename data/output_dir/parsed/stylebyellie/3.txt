(light tinkling music)
-  No, no.
We can't Easter yet.
Calvin, we can't Easter yet.
We can't Easter yet.
(mumbling)
We can't Easter yet.
Calvin.
-  Good Morning.
 Hi Jackson.
- Is it Easter?
-  It is!
- What is that?
-  Did you get your Easter Eggs?
-  Calvin put it all in his bucket.
-  Yeah. Jackson, do
you want to go get your bucket,
and put all the eggs in there?
- Why did you get these?
-  Oh, those are
from the Easter Bunny.
- What's this?
-  Wow.
-  Does that look so cool?
- But what is it?
(Calvin mumbling)
-  It looks like
a board to color on,
like at church and stuff.
-  Yeah.
- Look a golden egg.
-  What!
- Filled with gummy bears.
-  Whoa.
- Oooh.
what's this?
-  That looks like--
- A phone.
-  A phone?
(gasps) A phone for Easter.
-  Just for you.
I think it looks like a toothbrush.
-  It looks like a toothbrush
like mommy and daddy's, for you.
(gasps) Calvin, you know what that is.
- Bath bomb!
-  A bath bomb.
You gonna go get your bucket?
- Yeah!
-  Okay.
- There's eggs there.
(Calvin mumbling)
-  There is?
- I think it's funny that Jackson
didn't want to pick up the eggs.
-  Yeah, he wanted-
- He came to ask.
-  He wanted to make sure first.
- It's downstairs.
-  Those swimming goggles.
- These goggles, swimming goggles.
-  Yeah.
- It's so full.
Hey, why are there eggs up there?
-  Is there
something else over there?
-  It leads to something.
-  Why don't
you go follow the eggs?
Grab your bucket and follow the eggs.
What's this over here?
What does that look like?
-  Let's open up our eggs,
it looks like it goes to this.
-  Yeah, there's
letters on the inside.
-  What is that?
Your little flowers sprouted
just in time for Easter.
-  Yes, they did! Look at that.
-  I can't wait
until they grow, bloom.
- Now let's open our eggs.
-  Yeah, let's
see what's in your eggs.
- I'm going to open this one.
-  Okay.
- Open this one.
- A X!
-  An X? Oh my goodness.
-  Where does it go?
- Nope, this.
-  Does it go right there?
- Yeah.
-  Oh cool!
Calvin, what did you get?
-  Oh!
-  You got an O?
-  Uh, G.
-  G.
- Calvin, it goes right here.
Now I'm gonna open this one.
-  Okay, I think
it was so silly Jackson,
that you let--
- I got an S!
- That you didn't want
to pick up the eggs.
-  I know, that was kind of sweet.
- And sad.
- I got an S.
-  Find the one that
looks just like that one.
- This.
-  Yeah, find the same one.
-  Q, it's the lowercase Q.
- It says Q, it says Q.
-  Yeah, Q.
- I got a sneeze for Easter.
- Oh my god, you got a big sneeze.
-  Blow, blow.
- Let's wipe and now blow.
(Calming guitar music)
- Okay, I've got it.
-  You've got it?
Good job!
Yeah, you found the last
one, you finished it.
Good job, bud.
- See, this mess.
-  Look at this
mess, all of these eggs
had all of those things in it.
And you guys did it together, good job!
-  Every true
disciple of Jesus Christ.
- We are sitting here together as a family
watching General Conference.
It's all about inspiring
and uplifting talks.
We're just hanging out as a family.
Hey, your dress sure looks pretty.
- Thank you, I was looking at Jack's.
- Happy Easter bud.
Fist bump.
Happy Easter! (laughs)
Conference is now over
and it was wonderful.
We had a bunch of hours in front of the TV
listening to uplifting
and inspiring messages
and it was great.
But we've been sitting for a long time,
and now I think it's the perfect time
to go outside and get moving.
We've got a bunch of eggs in this bag
that I'm going to hide and
a couple of jackpot eggs.
And we're going to have the kids
go look for them and find them.
I mean, is it really Easter
without an Easter egg hunt?
See if I can get the
door with all this stuff.
Penny, hey sister, are
you going to help me
hide all these eggs, huh?
Or are you going to
sneak some for yourself?
I feel like you're the sneaky type.
Whoa!
Need I say more?
Hey! No peeking!
Calvin, go get your bucket.
Silly pants.
- Whoa!
-  Don't, no, no,
no peeking, no peeking.
Go get your bucket.
(Calvin mumbling)
Yeah, you see one?
Go get it, go get your boots on.
Jackson, you got your boots on?
- Is it cold?
-  Uh, it's windy.
But when it's not windy it's good.
You got your boots, you got your bucket.
- Thumbs up, fist bump. (pow)
Ow.
- Sorry, did my ring get ya?
- Yeah.
- Let's try it again.
This hand.
Better?
Dodododaloo.
- I think I could do this. (pow)
- Dododaloo, 'kay, let's get
our coats on and rock and roll.
On your mark.
Wait are you ready?
Mom, are you ready?
- I'm ready.
- Are you ready kids?
- Yeah!
- On your mark, get set, go!
(cheerful music)
I love that you pass.
Oh, oh, oh my goodness.
I don't know if... (laughs)
Our tree's too little. (laughs)
That was good Jackson, going
for the difficult ones first.
(eggs rattling in bucket)
-  I love this.
(kids Yelling)
(cheerful music)
- Whoa, egg, egg.
I found an egg.
-  I found a pink one here.
- This egg.
-  This is our first
Easter egg hunt in our backyard.
-  It is! That's so fun.
We've got some really good
hiding places, don't we?
As the kids get older.
-  Yeah.
- Wow! Favorite egg!
-  (laughs) Why does
that make me laugh so hard?
-  It's so sweet.
- What!
-  You found it.
- You want to put it here?
It's too big, what are
you going to do with it.
(laughter)
-  That's one way to crack it open.
- What's in it?
- Captain America.
-  Captain America.
- And Go fish! We'll play this today.
- What's in my bag.
-  'kay, go get it!
- Which one?
-  Go, go, go, this way!
This way!
- He said go this way.
-  He's not doing it.
-  He doesn't see it.
(Ellie laughs)
Jackson sees it from all the way up there.
Uh oh, Jackson's going to get it
and see it before Calvin does.
- There's a big egg!
-  It's right there Calvin.
(laughs) It's right there.
(laughing)
Jackson's going to get it before you do!
Hurry! Run! Run!
- No, I don't want that egg.
-  You don't want it?
- You can have it then.
- Yay! I got two jack eggs!
-  You didn't want the big one?
You want the little eggs?
I guess the thing about kids
is they always surprise you.
You would think that they
would want the biggest eggs
but Calvin's like, nope,
I want the little eggs.
Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter!
- I sure love you.
- I love you too.
I love that we get to do an
Easter egg hunt in our backyard.
- I can't believe this is the first one.
- I know.
- It's pretty great.
You remember last year when
we did the paint up there--
- It was fun.
- With all the dirt.
Full of mud though.
- It was so much fun.
It was great.
I loved it.
I'll have that video link down below
if you guys want to check it out too.
- (laughing) Next year we're
going to have a little one.
- Oh my goodness.
- Another little, little, little one.
Wearing my Bali dress today.
- It's beautiful.
- From our website, and it's so comfy.
I love this out here.
- Yeah, it's really nice.
I love you.
- I love you.
(crack)
: You got it.
: Whoa! Jackpot.
- I got Hulk! Look!
-  Do you guys love this?
Look at all these.
- The Jack egg, you got
Go Fish and you got I Spy.
'Cause Calvin didn't want the Jack egg.
-  Which is so
funny, he like saw it,
but just didn't want it because
he wanted the tiny eggs.
- Jack egg.
-  : Okay. Whoa.
Well, do you think we're
good on candy for a while?
- I think we're great.
- Yeah.
- I like, want to do that again.
- I know.
- Dang.
Easter egg hunts are so magical.
- They are, they are a lot of fun.
We had a wonderful day celebrating Easter,
spending time as a a family
listening to General Conference.
Spending time with family as
we did an Easter egg hunt.
Easter's a very special time for us.
Not only being with family
but, our hearts and our
minds, and our spirits.
So, we hope you had a wonderful day today.
I hope you enjoyed the same day upload,
and we will see you guys next time.
Say goodbye everyone! Say Happy Easter!
- Bye bye!
- Happy Easter
