here but it looked like a really fun
part well okay quiet ready to go hi

so much better now because le we have
what may be the most amazing lunch ever

kebabs I kept on wanting to say kebabs

off that's really good and Finland we

Turkish meal and it's really great but
anyway these leftovers are delicious

what do you see dinosaurs
what is that Jackson can you show me
your hand compared to that one check
what is that look how big it is like
that is follow up in here isn't that
crazy
I think one of the craziest things about
seeing all of these imprints especially
in this park over here this is like
where they have a shoreline of a lake
198 million years ago the crazy thing is
they had to go through one two three
four five six seven eight nine eight or
nine layers to get that imprint like
that's how far they had to go down like
if you made one mistake going for those
layers what Brendan Gaughan didn't say
it wasn't you think it's a popsicle no
no they had to go down and cut through
and see oh I'm sure our kids not been
the first to be back no no no no no I
will get a less Elmo Tom I can take it
oh my god Calvin just threw my
sunglasses into the 198 million year-old
shoreline well that's why didn't I think
about my layers yeah and I think we just
ruined one of the lures Oh
