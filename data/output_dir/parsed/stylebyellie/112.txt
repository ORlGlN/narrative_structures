- Today is December 1st.
(bright music)
- It snowed a lot.
- Bye poo.
- I have the completed version
of our first children's book.
- Eww.
- Oh.
(laughing)
(laugh-wheezing)
- Oh my goodness Jackson.
Look outside.
Penny you're so excited.
- It snowed a lot.
-  It snowed.
It's just a little little little bit
and it's melted on the sidewalk
and the grass, but look.
It snowed.
It's the first snow of the season.
Is that so cool?
We have snoooow.
But it'll probably be gone today,
but at least we have it noooow.
Should we go make a little snowman?
Okay.
- A tiny snowman.
-  A tiny snowman?
Yeah.
- Happy December 1st.
- What the heck?
- Come sit down and I'll tell you.
Today is December 1st
and we don't have a lot
of family traditions.
Our kids are still young.
We're learning year by year
- What the heck is this?
- kind of what we want to do,
what we like to do.
The kids are at perfect ages
- What the heck?
to start some traditions.
- What the heck is this?
- We've never really done this,
but this is an advent calendar.
And usually they are with chocolates,
and I really didn't want to
do chocolate advent calendars,
and I saw these cute Paw Patrol ones,
and I thought that the kids
would really like them.
An advent calender, look.
So what we do is every morning
after we eat breakfast,
this is a countdown to Christmas.
Ooh, don't push 'em all, 'cause look,
what number is that?
-  One one.
-  It's 11.
-  11.
-  So we push this,
so one, all the way to 24
for Christmas Eve.
So today, we're gonna
open just number one okay?
- Okay.
-  Do you want
to push number one in?
- Yeah.
(punching)
-  Should we open him up?
- Yeah.
- Whoa.
-  We have the same.
-  So every day, when
we're counting down the days
until Christmas, we are
gonna open up one of those
and you'll have a little
special prize in there.
And look, he can play on his
little play area right there.
- I'm gonna eat all of the candy canes.
I'm gonna play in the water.
Please?
- Yeah.
- Please Mama?
- Yay!
-  No.
- I'm floating in the water.
- So that's something that I want to do
is every year have some
sort of advent calendar.
I've even seen a lot that
you can make your own
and it can be really
special and about Christ.
I really would love to do that.
This year, I saw 'em and I grabbed 'em
and that's what we're doing this year.
But something else that
I really want to do
is read a lot more Christmas
books with the kids.
So we got My First Christmas,
and we're gonna read this
and it talks all about Jesus and his story
and so we're gonna do that.
I thought this would be really fun,
especially for church after quiet time.
What kind of book is this?
- Christmas.
-  It's a Christmas book
and you find these pictures in the book,
so we can sit and stare
at the picture, like this,
light, can you see this light
in the picture somewhere?
Can we find it?
It's right there,
and it's telling you to
find it in the picture.
Can you see the lantern?
Perfect.
So we're gonna do this a lot this month.
We're gonna look through all the pages,
on snowy days, hopefully.
- I'm gonna build a tiny snowman.
- I know we need to make
one if it snows more.
It's actually a really warm November.
It's been a really warm
November and December.
And then last but not least,
I really wanted to do this as well,
so I wanted to read more books,
have an advent calendar,
and then of course the
festivities that we do.
But I did see this as well,
and I thought that this was really fun.
It's a little Christmas book,
and at the end of every night,
we'll read this for bed
and it has things for you to do,
whether it's service, scriptures,
there's tons of scriptures,
and so when we do that, we'll show you
when we do that.
(lively music)
Let's try again,
and we'll come back and play.
Let's try again.
- Bye poo.
Look at me.
(lively music)
-  Oh Calvin.
Smile you're on camera,
Calvin's been filming for
the past five minutes.
(Jared laughing)
- Calvin.
-  Calvin, you set the camera up.
It was fun seeing you guys.
Thanks for stopping by.
- We'll see you on the trail.
- Bye.
-  Bye, oh yeah, you've got
your four-wheeler out there, huh?
- Yep, yep.
- Okay, drive safe guys.
- I love you baby.
- Aww.
- A few of our cousins just got here
and Jackson has been
out on the Segway, guys.
He has been riding the Segway.
I am so proud of you bud.
(upbeat music)
Is that hard work?
- It's hard to turn.
-  It is kinda hard to turn,
but you turn it with this, so get on.
You've got to turn it with your arms.
Yep.
Wow.
You're doing good.
You just got on it and wanted to ride.
Poop patrol.
Poop patrol!
- Clean the poop!
-  Good job.
(upbeat music)
- So I just got back from taking Penny
on this glorious walk,
and I pull in to the garage
and I notice there's
three girls in my garage
and they're all surrounding one person
and I'm like what the
heck is possibly going on,
like what are these girls doing.
Sure enough, they part ways,
and it's this guy right here.
- Hey!
- So Landon and Julie are here,
and they just did haircuts
in our garage, so.
(laughs)
That's embarrassing I'm sorry.
Too inappropriate, right Jared?
-  Are you guys watching a show?
- Yeah.
- We're watching Boss Baby.
-  How many kids do we got in here?
-  We got five,
Decorated this cute thing today.
-  One two three four--
(Ellie laughs)
- We just finished up
with dinner and Emma,
hi, Emma just came up to me
and goes I found this money
downstairs, here you go.
And I was like, you're so honest,
you keep it and put it in your piggy bank.
And she's so happy about that.
- Well she goes, can I still put my tooth
under my pillow and get more money
from the tooth fairy?
- Well she told me,
she's like, no it's okay,
I'm like what kid says no to
money in their piggy bank?
She's like I'm gonna put
my tooth under my pillow,
and I'm like, you can have this too.
- Cute, well it was a two dollar bill,
are like special dollar bills.
(laughing)
- Bonnie just finished making dinner.
We all just ate.
It's been really good.
Julie made this pizza, cookie pizza,
which is so good,
and then Bonnie made broccoli cheese soup.
So good.
- Bye buddy,
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay.
Bye Olivia, have fun at the party, okay?
-  Hey Code, Cody.
Maybe tomorrow, we can
get your football okay?
-  Does that sound good?
- Tomorrow's my friend's birthday.
-  We'll figure out a time frame.
-  Maybe before or after, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, we are gonna get him a ball,
because Penny popped his
- Yes we are.
- at Thanksgiving.
- I felt so bad.
- That's okay.
- We'll get him a good one.
- There were lots of balls to play with
and that one was just
extra soft and it popped.
- Alright children gather 'round,
I have some very exciting news,
some exciting announcements to make.
May I sit in the chair?
In my hand, I have something very cool.
I have the completed version
of our first children's book.
We wrote a book for you Emma
and for you Jackson and for you Calvin
and for you and your kids.
It's our very first Pretty Penny book.
- It is.
I can't wait to hear it.
- It's so cute.
The artwork is amazing.
Should we show 'em a sneak peak?
- Totally.
- Okay.
- I feel so privilege to be like--
- Boo.
(laughing)
- To be one of the first
to hear this book.
- Thanks well I haven't heard all of it.
- You haven't?
-  I think the
artwork is my favorite,
like look how beautiful that is.
It's so fun.
Are you ready to read it Emma?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let me read it to you.
Let's get all the kids in here,
this is exciting.
Our first book and I'm gonna read it
to all these kids.
(gentle music)
We are sitting here at our house.
The kids are all asleep right now.
And you know what we're talking about?
We're talking about babies.
That's what we're talking about, kids.
- While our kids are asleep.
- Yeah.
- Babies.
- But Julie and Ellie are both pregnant.
We've been talking about what we think
that they're going to have.
My brother Matt has three boys
and they're having a girl now,
congratulations Matt and Emily.
Our sister in law Emily, she doesn't know
what she's having yet.
- I don't think she's gonna find out.
- Yeah, and you guys don't know what,
but we're just talking about,
what if it's a boy, what if it's a girl.
I don't know, it's just
kind of fun to think about,
and fun to imagine life with a girl
and fun to imagine life with another boy,
like how the relationships of our kids
are going to be affected by that.
Like if we have a girl,
how are Calvin and Jackson going to react
to a girl versus a boy?
You know, it's just fun
to think about that stuff.
Would you look at the
size of these cookies.
- Are you talking about me?
(Jared laughing)
-  It's warm still.
- This is the best treat ever.
- Oh yeah.
-  The cookies or yours?
- Mine (laughs).
-  My cookies?
-  It's like yogurt,
you want your cookies?
These are ginormous.
-  They're like
the size of my hand.
-  I know, and they're
still warm to the touch.
Feel these cookies.
- Oh.
(laughing)
-  Take a bite of this cookie.
(Jared laughing)
- You're welcome for
the zit in the morning.
-  Oh.
(laughing)
- Okay.
- Eww.
- Oh.
(laughing)
(laugh-wheezing)
(laughing)
- Oh that's disgusting.
How are we so disgusting?
-  Bonnie has moved
past the laughing stage
and is now in the wheezing stage.
- Okay okay don't laugh.
-  What's the
goal of this right here?
- This is, okay we're gonna--
- Just because we're proud
of how hideous we are.
-  The double chin, is that what--
- Yeah it's intense, okay?
- I am not doing that.
-  They totally need
to put their jaws under.
-  (laughing) That
was a good prep Julie,
that was like a wind up.
(laughing)
- I think there's more skin under there.
-  Gather it all up.
(laughing)
- Oh this is bad.
- What entertains it on
a Friday night, right?
Cookies, pizza bites and double chins.
(Jared laughs)
- Here, let's just do it again.
- I want to see yours.
I think we'll get one.
-  Triple threat.
- Okay.
- Alright.
-  This is the thumbnail,
make it good.
- Oh stop.
-  Everyone do the wind up on
one two three.
(Jared laughing)
