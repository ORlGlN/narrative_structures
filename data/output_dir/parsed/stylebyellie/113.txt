- I know what it's like
(bright music)
to be grateful to have a baby.
- We're getting our haircuts together,
you excited bud?
- Yeah.
-  When you hang out with Dad,
you get to do some fun stuff, huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
I have to ask Ellie if
Bonnie can go with me.
(laughing)
I am crossing my fingers.
- I bet there's a thousand people in line.
(cheering and clapping)
-  Yeah!
- Good morning.
(laughs)
Look at me today.
Hi Cal, good morning.
Guess what we're doing today?
I think Calvin's been ready
to be potty trained for awhile,
and I'm going to give it this weekend
to work with him on potty training
and see how he adapts to it.
He's really good to sit on the toilet
and I think the warming up
process is so good for kids.
It took awhile to warm
Jackson up to the toilet
when we were potty training him.
Calvin, it's worked so fast.
I think it's because he sees his brother,
and so he's more willing.
So we have underwear on him.
So we're gonna try this
weekend to see how things go.
And Jared just called me.
And Jared doesn't get flustered,
I guess much, with YouTube,
and we've talked about this a lot,
but just to reiterate,
it's sometimes hard for me
and Jared to film our
daily what's going on,
because sometimes, and
it's not even a lot,
sometimes it's just a few people
will take that and spin it.
And I'm pregnant, I'm sick, I love it,
and I always always end it with,
I'm grateful, I love it.
I know what it's taken me to get a baby.
I laid on that damn bathroom floor,
for eight hours, cramping, crying,
bleeding trying to miscarry.
I know what it's like to
be grateful to have a baby.
And so when we film about, I'm sick,
this is what happened,
I'm just trying to give you guys a vlog,
and I'm just trying to
show you what's going on
in a 10 week pregnant body, you know?
So I'm not complaining.
I have never once
complained about pregnancy.
I prayed to God that
if I could get pregnant
with Jackson, I will never complain.
And I definitely have told God it hurts,
it hurts to be pregnant.
It hurts when you sneeze,
and like you feel like
your stomach rips open.
But that's not complaining,
that's explaining what
it's like to be pregnant.
I have been grateful for every
second of my kids' childhood
and I truly believe that I
have soaken up every second.
I am a mom and I am a mother
and that is the only thing
in my life that matters,
being a mom, and paired with
that is being a wife to Jared.
But that is something that I've wanted
for a long time, and it's something
that I don't take lightly
or that I don't take for granted.
So I definitely have to say that,
(laughs)
then I'll move on with
the rest of my pregnancy.
But by me talking about symptoms,
by me talking about situations,
by me being frustrated that Calvin
is ripping the toilet paper to shreds
in the bathroom, that's just motherhood.
And it sucks, it sucks that he ripped up
a whole toilet paper roll,
but I'm just showing you it sucks,
that doesn't mean I'm
not grateful for him,
it doesn't mean I'm not
grateful for pregnancy,
I'm just explaining,
that's what a vlog is for.
That's the purpose of our vlog,
is just to show you what the heck
is going on in our world.
And it's weird that some
people want to watch it,
it's weird that I want to watch others,
but there are a handful of vlogs
that I connect with, that
I really enjoy watching
that in a way that they don't even realize
has helped me become a better person.
It's a weird thing, vlogging
and filming your life
is weird, but it's also really cool
and really special and I've
learned a lot about myself.
But I did have to tell you that.
So speaking of, I was
dizzy all night last night.
I laid in bed and I
thought, what is going on,
I am dizzy.
I'm gonna call the doctor,
because I am on some medicine
that it is okay to be
on when you're pregnant,
but I am worried,
because I notice when I take it,
I get super super dizzy
and I don't think that
that should be the case,
so I'm gonna call, figure that out.
Mr. Cal Cal.
Hey.
Do you need to go potty?
Do you need to go potty?
Huh, no?
Just poop?
Go hide in the corner.
Jackson.
- What?
-  Is this the first
time you've ever seen this?
- Yeah.
-  We're watching the
original Christmas movies,
Jackson's never seen.
And I think the Abominable
Snowman's coming
and that used to scare my brother Beau.
What do you think of the
movies you've never seen?
- I like it.
-  I'm so glad.
- This reminds me of childhood.
-  That's why we're watching it.
- I love this.
-  How was pre-school?
Good, he passed off his letters.
- Yeah you passed off
your letters today, huh?
Boom.
Do I get a one, blended
up through the sides?
Is that what I do?
-  Yes.
- One, okay.
-  Yes.
- I'll race you to the car.
-  Oh I don't know, I don't know.
Oh you beat me, you're so quick.
You ready to spend some good quality
father-son time together?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, what do
you want to do today?
- A hair cut and get chocolate milk.
- Oooh that sounds like so much fun.
We're getting our haircuts together,
you excited bud?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, should you get a
mohawk today, ya think?
Yeah, you want a mohawk?
Okay, when we get in
there, I want you to say,
I want a mohawk, okay?
- Okay.
- And that's what they'll
cut your hair as, alright?
- Okay.
(laughs)
-  Didn't ask for a mohawk, huh?
- Yeah.
(Jared laughs)
-  Looks good buddy.
You're almost done.
- That was a great day.
- Well yeah, you got of couple
handsome fellas right here,
with our haircuts, what do you think?
- Good.
- It's good.
Is that your first soda
pop all to yourself?
- Uh-huh.
- That was so cool.
I actually think this is one
of Jackson's first soda pops,
but they offered one.
And you were like what's a soda pop?
And what flavor is it?
- Soda.
- Black cherry soda.
Is it good?
- Mmm-hmm.
- We'll keep this our little secret, okay?
We won't tell Mom about it.
At least until we get home.
Let's go.
- I'll put this in my cup holder.
(Jared laughs)
- We'll see about that,
we'll see about that.
When you hang out with Dad,
you get to do some fun stuff, huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
Joel Joel, tonight,
no guys break it up,
break it up, break it up.
- Sorry.
- Joel tonight is the movie screening
of Psych the Movie tonight.
Should we try and go?
It's in one hour,
(Bonnie yells)
oh, it's in one hour,
no it's in two hours,
but the doors open at six.
It's five o'clock.
Do you think we can make it?
- I can make it.
- Should we do it?
- No, this is like for real.
Joel has to cancel like YU deeds.
- We can do it, we can
postpone, we'll be okay.
-  But you have to want to do this.
- I want to do this.
Do you want me to do this?
- I would love if you went and did that.
- (whispers) I have to ask my permission.
Can I go?
- I want to go.
- Do you want to go with Jared?
- I have to ask Ellie if
Bonnie can go with me.
(laughing)
Seriously though, this is like the debate,
because so the doors open
at five, to wait in line
to get in at six, the
movie starts at seven,
and there's a Q&A afterwards.
We live an hour and a half
away from there right now,
so we're gonna get there a little bit
after the doors open.
So are there gonna be enough people
there that there's no way
we're gonna get there?
We won't know until we drive down there.
- There hasn't been any hype
about this on the news yet.
I'm hoping that the word's
kinda been on the down low.
- But the thing is, I think
you're underestimating
the Psych audience in Utah.
-  Oh yeah.
- They're coming to Salt Lake,
because people voted for it.
- Oh okay.
- I'm a Psych fan and I
haven't heard anything.
- My go is you're literally
not gonna be able to get in.
But I want you to,
(Jared groans)
I want you to go and try,
because what if there's room?
- Yeah.
- And what if you show
up and they're like,
Jared, Joel, come on in.
- We could meet Shawn and Gus.
- I know.
I feel like James Roday would see me,
and he's like, oh yeah,
come on, front row Jared.
- Gus'll be like, hey,
there's my buddy, come on.
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- Should we try this?
I'm kind of freaking out.
- I'm game.
- I can't believe I forgot it was today.
I thought it was like the 4th.
- Yeah, you were saying
like a week from now.
And we were making plans.
- I thought it was the 4th.
- Ugh, okay, let's go--
- I think you should try it.
- Okay alright, we'll try, we'll try.
We're gonna try this.
We have our wives' permission.
We got the okay from them.
We are racing down to
Salt Lake city right now.
It is five o'clock on the dot,
so if we do this right,
we will be there on time.
It's not a matter of time.
- Mmm-hmm.
- We will be there on time,
it's a matter of capacity.
Kingsbury Hall has a seat
capacity of 1,992 people.
The question is, are there 1,990 people
and then us
seats, you know?
- What if we were the 91 and 92?
- Oh my gosh.
- The last two people to enter?
- All of it would be worth it.
- it's totally worth it.
- Totally worth it.
(upbeat music)
Joel that's some skilled
driving you've done there.
You've navigated through
like a Tetris piece.
Just weaved in and out.
- I think we owe the state
of Utah a great thanks.
For the occasion they
raised all the speed limits
five miles per hour.
- They actually did.
I don't know when they did this,
but all of the speed limits
were up five miles per hour,
which helped us.
It is 6:24.
The premier starts at seven.
I have confirmed through Twitter
to other people who are seeing this event,
that I have RSVP'd and
we're not on standby.
So that should be good news for us.
This has been the adventure of a lifetime
and whether we get in or not, Joel,
I'm happy I did it with you.
- It's good traveling with you, buddy.
- Oh my gosh is that,
- Oh that's the standby line.
-  That's gotta
be the standby line.
-  Think I can part right there?
Can I park right there?
- I don't know.
-  Well it's worth a shot.
Is that a Psych vehicle?
That's gotta be a Psych vehicle.
Joel?
-  Yep.
-  We're there.
We made it.
- We made it, everybody else behind us,
it's too bad for them.
- Yeah, suckers.
We are literally the last ones in line,
uh, but there's still standby.
These are RSVP's so I think we're okay.
- The standby line looks pretty big too.
- Does it?
- I'm feeling nervous.
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah.
- I am crossing my fingers.
- I bet there's a thousand people in line.
-  Oh jeez,
that's a lot of gas money
to not go to see this movie.
- It's worth it Jared, it's worth it.
-  Oh be still my heart, Joel.
Be still my heart, I can see the signs.
-  Yeah.
-  We're almost there.
- Psych.
- Found it.
-  Found the pineapple.
-  There's the pineapple.
(Jared laughs)
-  Joel we did it!
- We're in.
- We're in!
I'm gonna drop my camera.
We're here we made it,
we did it, oh my gosh,
I cannot believe this.
We're gonna go see the movie right now.
Hi, just go downstairs?
Oh my gosh.
(laughing)
I gotta get these on.
Oh my goodness.
Woo hoo.
Look at this, here, do
you want some popcorn?
Grab some popcorn Joel, here you go.
(cheering)
Are you ready for this dude?
- Oh my gosh.
(cheering and clapping)
- Robert, film illustrator.
(cheering and clapping)
There was a contest all over Twitter,
and they've narrowed it to 10 great cities
in the United States.
Chicago almost did it.
(crowd booing)
Chicago came in second.
Second place.
And there was one city
with a few more votes.
In fact, the difference
between the first place
and second place, was double,
second place was--.
(cheering)
-  Wow!
Woo yeah!
- It's Maggie Lawson.
-  Yeah!
(clapping and cheering)
Woo hoo!
Get out of town.
This night just keeps getting better.
What is this,
- Have a nice night.
just a pineapple?
-  It's a pineapple man.
It has a straw.
- Ah!
- You can like drink stuff out of it.
-  That's so cool Joel.
And we end our evening as we gaze
over the city of Salt,
our minds nourished, our bellies laughed.
Laughed, does that work?
I'm trying to be funny.
- I'm calling it.
It's laughed.
-  Laughed, bellies laughed,
and our hearts fall,
as we drive home.
The two hour drive that
we did in one hour,
thanks go Joel.
- I can do it again, I can do it again.
- Seriously though, that was next level.
That was so much fun.
Like Psych is the show that I,
high school, college,
that's where I spent time,
that's like how I was entertained.
When I had my hip surgery,
I had three months of recovery time
at my Grandma's house,
and I had season two of Psych to watch.
So I know season two of Psych
like the back of my hand.
Black and Tan,
a crime of fashion?
- How dare you judge us?
- Yeah, that's like my
favorite episode of Psych,
but Psych has a special place in my heart
and I'm so happy that
we were able to be here.
I'm so happy that we were able to get in.
I RSVP'd, but I didn't know
that that guaranteed you to get in,
because there were so many people in line,
but we did it and it was amazing.
Thanks for driving Joel,
thanks for coming with me.
- Anytime, buddy.
Thanks for the RSVP.
-  Hey, you're my plus one.
- Thanks.
- Move over Ellie,
you're my plus one Joel.
(laughing)
