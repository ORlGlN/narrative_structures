- (Ellie gasps)
(upbeat music)
(Calvin screams)
- Tonight is pumpkin carving night.
We are gonna parve, we're
gonna parve pumpkins.
We're going to carve pumpkins tonight.
- You lost some brain cells (mumbles).
-  I did.
Good morning, it is a bit chilly
and it's a bit dark in here,
let's hit those lights.
Guess what, I've got a
solution to our chilly problem.
It's this button right
here, ready for this,
hey that's my light, don't worry,
we've got the warmth right here, boom.
Wait for it, boom, there we go.
It's time to start the fireplace,
that's so crazy to me, it's
mid-October, no way Jose.
- Yes way.
-  I'm, I'm keeping myself warm,
keeping my body warm,
aren't you a little chilly?
Oh no way, how do you
like your new blasters?
- These are blasters.
-  Do you like them?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they're fun for about a minute.
It's cause they're loud that's,
that's what I'm trying to say.
- I do not know how many more fall
beautiful warm days we are gonna have.
So we are taking advantage
of Chick-fil-A, and the park.
We have Calvin the rock climber.
We have Spider-Man, hi,
hey undo my webs, thanks.
I kinda love that wherever we go
Jackson wants to wear his costume
and I will never tell him no.
He can wear that costume
to church if he wanted.
-  (mumbles).
-  You are
pumping, all by yourself.
Good job, when we go to grandma's
next can you try it at her house?
- Sure.
- Sure, you're getting it to, huh.
- My favorite part of the park
to go on that tire swing and that one.
- Swinging, you know, that's
always my favorite too.
We don't have a swing
set, huh, nope, someday.
- Just teeter-totter.
- Just a teeter-totter, you are cute.
Hey, I like my dates with you.
Calvin's just running, playing, huh.
Can't even see him, call
his name, oh there he is.
He's behind there,
Calvin, do you wanna eat?
-  No.
(Ellie and Jackson laughing)
-  Did you just hear him.
He just said, no, Calvin.
-  (mumbles), rock.
-  You're on a rock,
hey Calvin do you wanna eat?
- No.
-  No, why is that funny?
Do you know you used to say that too?
Yeah, sometimes you still
say no, huh, yeah I do too.
-  Now I'm a clown.
-  Ew, you look disgusting, ew.
- Do you want to be one of these clowns?
-  Yeah.
-  Do you wanna be it Calvin?
What, okay we went from no
costumes to scary, you like it.
-  No, no put
in on your eyes in it.
-  (mumbles).
-  You have a nose?
-  Yeah.
-  'Kay, do you need to pick it?
'Kay pick your nose,
oh it's not your nose?
-  That's impressive.
-  Perfect (laughing), thanks.
That escalated extremely quickly
from going from absolutely
no costumes to that bad boy,
oh no, now we got a
horse, neigh, (laughing).
-  Where is my eyes.
-  Where's your eyes?
- Alright kiddos here's the deal.
Here's the situation I have been on my,
oh no, oh no, oh no, I came
roaring down the stairs
and you were asleep, I'm
so sorry, I'm so sorry.
So here's the situation, (laughing),
I have been in my office since six AM
it is now six PM I have been on my butt
working for 12 hours straight.
And my bum is upset with me, my bum.
-  Literally it has been.
-  Yeah, my bum does not like me.
-  Aw, you need to poop?
- Well no not poop, it's just
I saw on Facebook you know these
purple mattresses that you see everywhere.
They have a seat cushion and I was like
my butt hates me right
now, I should get one.
- No to be honest, I would love to
I wanna try a pillow out,
'cause I love my mattress.
-  Oh yeah.
- And I love the mattresses we have
at the house, but I want to try a pillow.
- You wanna try a pillow, I think
that would be a great
idea, hey still like them.
'Kay they still like
them from this morning.
Me on the other hand I'm not quite sure.
Can you whistle, no really loud
come on whistle really loud.
(Calvin yelling)
(everyone laughing)
That's a good whistle.
- You're a goofball.
- Do you want me to
show you how it's done?
Ready, can I do it with this hand?
-  Try it.
- Am I an ambi-whistler,
(whistles) you try.
- (mumbles).
Okay, so tonight is pumpkin carving night.
We are gonna parve, we're
gonna parve, cumpkins, oh geez.
We're going to carve pumpkins tonight.
- I think you lost some
brain cells (mumbles).
- I did, so if you remember I asked
you guys like a week or two ago.
What I should carve on a pumpkin.
I take pumpkin carving
very, very seriously.
And you guys voted and you guys gave
thumbs up to a specific comment.
And the highest comment
was overwhelmingly, guess.
- Penny.
- Yes you are right, Penny is
the pumpkin of choice today.
So what I'm gonna do with you guys,
is I'm gonna show you the process
that I normally take when I carve
what I think is a pretty detailed pumpkin.
I'll show you step by
step and then hopefully
it'll turn out the way that I want.
- And these are the pumpkins
that he has carved, previously.
-  Bing, bing, bing, bing.
- Mom and dad just texted me and said
that they're gonna come say hi.
- Oh fun, that's great,
maybe they'll see my pumpkin.
-  Yeah it's gonna take all night.
- Actually it'll probably
take me the whole night, yeah.
I gotta start now if I wanna finish today.
Okay so I am at my computer right now.
And I have a picture of Penny
loaded up here in Photoshop.
And essentially what we're gonna do
it's pretty simple, and I think
you can do it in mostly other
software packages too, it
doesn't have to be Photoshop.
In fact I think there's some online
tools that you can do it for free too.
But essentially what we're gonna do is,
we're going to, make the picture
black and white, and create it
so it can be used as a stencil.
And that's only a few
steps it's really easy.
On here, is we're just gonna go to,
hit command, shift, U, and that
will turn it into
gray-scale, black and white.
From there, what you do is, we're
gonna increase the
contrast, so the white's
are white and the dark's are dark.
And this just makes it
so there's not as many
layers that we're cutting
through on the pumpkin.
You can do that a couple different ways.
You can go through levels or you
can just go to brightness and contrast.
And you just boost that contrast up.
And because Penny is a yellow lab,
and the contrast is already really,
really great, I'm gonna lower
the brightness down just a smidge
and then boost that contrast up.
And each picture is gonna vary
differently depending
on what you're doing.
So hit okay on that, and then from there.
I mean this is a pretty good
idea of what you would get.
But we can take it a couple steps further.
And for that you would just go to,
back to adjustments, and
then you'd hit threshold.
And that's gonna take it into
very, very finite layers, although
your threshold level says differently,
you can see that there's only a couple
of different colors,
they're white and black,
it doesn't do like to many grays.
And you can adjust that, and see where
your blacks are reaching out.
And that sort of thing, and
to where you want it to be.
Now I played with it a little bit earlier.
And I got one I like pretty well.
And it kinda looks like this.
So I took the exposure
tool and I brushed around
her ears a little bit more here and here
so you could see that, and I created
the white in her eyes a little bit.
This is what it would look like
on the pumpkin, if you wanna see
what it would look like as a stencil
just hit command, I,
control, I on Windows.
And that will invert it and
that's essentially your stencil.
And in this situation, what you would do
is you would dot out and cut out
the black parts, and
leave the white parts.
For the pumpkin to actually show through.
The next step that you're gonna wanna take
is either get your family and your kids
to do this together, or like we did
wait til our kids fall asleep
so there's no distractions whatsoever.
It's late and our kids,
it's bedtime for our kids.
So what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna get our table area set up.
We're gonna cut out the
top part of the pumpkin.
And then, empty it out,
shave out the inside.
You know what you do, normally
do with a pumpkin when you carve it.
So we're gonna prepare the pumpkin.
I like to put a little notch in my carving
so I know exactly where
it goes when I take it out
and so I can put it back
in really, really, quickly.
Then you're just gonna shave off
all the insides there, so you
have a nice clean pumpkin.
This part to me may be
one of the hardest parts.
And that's getting your
stencil onto the pumpkin,
to where it lays out as flat as possible.
Because you're working with a flat piece
of paper and a round pumpkin
it doesn't work all that well.
But I'm just using some thumbtacks
here to, or pushpins, to close it in there
and give it as good a seal as I can.
And here's my Penny stencil.
What are you carving today Ellie?
- The easiest thing I could find.
- From there it's just a matter
of using like a pushpin tool to like
outline your tracing so you can
take the paper off and start carving.
Sometimes what I'll do is I will,
if I have multiple layers, or shades.
I'll fill out that layer
and then I'll mark it
with that letter, or the layer
number that I want it to be.
(upbeat music)
Now if you did this right, and you didn't
make any mistakes, 'cause I never ever do.
You should be able to take this off
and essentially see your pattern.
Right there, you see it?
So now, I've just gotta shade,
all of the places that
are not punched out.
And that's gonna take a long time.
Now for most pumpkins, simple pumpkin
carving tools, oh those all just fell,
will do just fine, I'm doing some
shading and everything so I actually
just use like wood carving tools.
And they have different angles
and different tools so you can like
swipe down and it'll pull
some pumpkin stuff off.
Or different like edging tools.
So it just makes it a little easier.
I think everything that I do here
I could do with those as well.
(soft music)
After I took the X-Acto knife
and basically outlined all the dots.
Now I'm just going
through and like carving,
shading off, all those
pieces off the skin,
off the pumpkin, and
then I'll smooth it out.
(soft music)
I've done all the initial shading,
it's just one layer right now.
And I'm going to hit the lights
and see what it looks like, but
I wanna show you what it looks like
first before the lights are hit.
That, is what I've got so far.
I feel like it's pretty good.
Obviously there's some ridges
so if I could smooth
that out that'd be great.
But I don't think you'll see it
in the light, you know what I mean?
- I like the texture.
-  You do?
- She's a puppy.
-  It's a cute
little doggy, let's light it
up don't you think, I'll
see what it looks like.
One other very important thing
is when you're doing pumpkin
carving and everything it's very
important that you bring along
your favorite drink with yah,
'kay, and maybe like Netflix.
-  And chill.
-  Yeah, it's not quite showing
the light that I want it to,
it actually looks a lot better in camera.
But I've gotta do a couple things.
So I'm gonna flip on the
lights and explain to you.
If you're not getting
the light that you want
on the outside of the pumpkin,
the easiest way to get more light through.
Is to just shave off the inside.
So all you do is you take your scraper.
And just scrape on the inside
of the pumpkin, that will
thin the layer out and then
you have a brighter pumpkin.
Okay, it's 12:30 in the morning,
I feel like I'm gonna call it
done I don't know, we'll see.
-  It's beautiful,
it's good, show it.
-  You think it's good?
-  Yep.
-  Okay, so here is Penny.
-  Look it's perfect,
that is freaking Penny.
-  So good, aw Penny it's you.
-  And then there's the scary one.
-  That's the pirate
jack-o-lantern ar matey.
-  Penny's beautiful.
-  I think it looks so good,
it's like hyper realistic,
Penny that's you.
That's you, you know that, huh?
Well guys I hope you enjoyed those
small tips for carving the
best pumpkin of your life.
That's what I've done for years
and, I don't know, I
think it's pretty fun.
So I hope you enjoyed it, if you did
give it a big thumbs up, let me know
what you guys carved
this year for Halloween.
Also send me, send me a Tweet,
or an Instagram with what you carved.
I'd love to see what you guys did.
Thank you so much for watching the video,
hope you have a wonderful day,
and we will see you guys next time, bye.
