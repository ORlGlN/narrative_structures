Calvin feels a little feverish he's
wanting to go out he's pointing out so
bad
I think when you wake up mommy and daddy
and Calvin are gonna go on the boat and
you're gonna ping out with Grandma you'd
be good for Grandma you getting some
teeth in there he wants to go so bad
okay where's your bed bed
hey lady head down okay you're making
some progress around here um I usually
will lay Calvin down for his two naps
just in his crib and walk out and he
does really really well nighttime is not
that way I cannot just lay him down and
leave but we're getting progress like I
can do that for an out time I don't mind
rocking him at night if that's what he
wants for now yeah it's funny cuz when
Jackson was like 5 months old I want to
say he would point he wouldn't want to
be rocked anymore maybe a little door
maybe like eight months you'd point to
the crib and he'd want to just lay John
Calvin's not that way I'm really proud
of Calvin because that's a big big
change for him to at least lay down and
take a nap what you want to watch a
train okay I think we can watch a little
show while mom packs for the lake
