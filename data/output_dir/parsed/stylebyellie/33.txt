- What could you possibly be
doing, and I'm not involved?
You're smiling.
See, I told you he could do it.
Juice in a cup.
- Juice in cup!
Good morning, guys. I think
someone is loving the home pot.
- (singing) Home again
-  Your nails are so pretty today.
- I matched my nails to my lipstick.
I am wearing 'Under the
Thumb'. -  Oh.
- Thanks for getting this for me
-  You're welcome
(Singing) From now on,
what's waited till
tomorrow starts tonight!
It starts tonight!
Ellie and I are making the bed right now,
and I just put this pillow on,
and she said "get the
pillow the right way".
So, it was like this.
So is there a difference--
-  It's 'cause the bottom.
-  Oh, the bottom.
Okay, so where's the bottom?
Okay, so this line.
That's the identifying
feature of the pillow.
'Cause I'm looking at the
design, and I'm just like--
-  How do you know?
-  How do you even know?
One thing that I love about Ellie,
is every day our bed is made.
And that is just like such
a clean looking thing.
It just makes our bed--
oh, we're missing a pillow.
We're missing three pillows.
Holy cow!
- Jackson and Calvin always
help me with the pillows.
They know the right way.
- They do know the right
way, I guess I need to learn.
But, making your bed is
something simple that you can do
to make your room feel that much better.
-  I'm not wearing underwear!
- Don't worry, you can't see anything!
Okay, now we're done.
Ellie, put some pants on!
-  Jared!
-  What?
-  There's the pillow.
-  Oh my gosh.
Is that better?
(Ellie Whoops)
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think
you're going, young man?
What, you're going to school?
Oh okay, don't you think you need someone
to drive you to school first?
- No.
-  No?
You're just gonna walk?
- Mhm.
-  Okay, well
have fun at school, okay?
- Okay.
-  Love you.
Bye, bye.
'Kay, he's going to school, mom.
Mom and dad didn't
think that it was enough
for just us to go to the dentist, 'kay?
Alright?
So guess what.
You, and you are going to the dentist now.
We are gonna have some fun at the dentist!
- Are you driving us there,
and are you both gonna stay?
-  Yep, you better believe it.
- We'll stay with you.
-  Yep, sound good?
- Yep.
-  We're gonna make sure
those pearly whites are nice and clean.
Calvin, can you show me your teeth?
(Jarred laughs)
Can you show me your teeth?
Yeah!
-  Let me see them.
Are they white, or are they yellow?
-  Are they brown?
- My eye's brown.
-  Your eyes are
brown, that's right.
What about your teeth?
- Red.
-  Yeah, that's red.
Everything but his teeth.
Well, you definitely
look like you're ready
for your first dentist appointment.
Say "cheese"!
(Jared laughs)
Say "cheese"!
- Cheese!
-  You're kind of a
professional at this point, huh?
Did you do good?
Show me your teeth.
Yeah, they're still all there,
they didn't take any out.
Should we ask them if
they'll take any out for ya?
(Jared laughs)
I'm just kidding.
You were giving us a little
trouble there, weren't ya?
You didn't wanna open your mouth, did you?
Can you open your mouth for me?
Say "aah".
Show me your teeth.
(babbles)
- Can you hear it?
-  Do you hear it, Calvin?
Do you hear the movie?
We've got LEGO Batman, and Wreck it Ralph.
(Cheerful music)
On the way home from the
dentist Calvin and Ellie zonked.
They're asleep right now.
But, it went fifty percent great,
and fifty percent not so great.
M-mm, uh-uh, wasn't great at all.
Are you playing Zelda?
You are crazy, dude.
Hey, Jackson wait real quick.
Let's put this down for just a minute.
I want you to tell me about the dentist.
- I did so good.
-  You did so good.
And what did they do to you?
- They cleaned my teeth.
-  Did they take
pictures of your teeth?
And what did the dentist
say about your teeth?
- No cavities.
-  No cavities!
High-five, good job.
That's great, bud.
-  This poor guy, I'm
gonna tell you all about it.
Look, he's got a little
Papa Troll with him.
Poor Calvin, and I think the
timing just wasn't that great.
It was like 12:30, 1 o'clock.
Like, right before, if
Calvin does take a nap,
it's about that Calvin takes a nap.
And I can tell he was pretty tired.
He's not feeling well,
probably 'cause of this guy.
Plumber's crack!
And he, I think he's just
catching what Jackson had.
So he wasn't feeling all that great,
he didn't really want
to be poked and prodded
and all of that stuff.
He did really great with
the dental assistant,
and was showing me how
he would "open wide".
But, once the dentist actually came in
and started looking at things he just,
he didn't wanna be there,
and he didn't want someone's
fingers in his mouth.
But, poor guy, as soon
as we got in the car
he fell asleep and zonked out.
But all in all, for a
first dentist appointment,
I don't think it was that bad.
Next time, he'll be
better because of timing.
I think that was the huge issue
was the time of day that
we went to the dentist.
Hopefully, when he wakes up
he'll feel a little better.
 What did you want, little monster?
- Juice in cup.
-  Juice in a cup?
What do you want?
- Juice in cup!
-  Juice in a cup!
What do you want?
- Juice cup!
-  Juice in a cup!
Juice in a cup!
Hey, you had the longest nap of your life.
Do you feel better?
- Yeah!
-  Good!
Hey, can you do something for me?
Open wide, say "aah".
- Aah!
- See, I told you he could do it!
I told ya!
We've been practicing.
We actually did practice before
the dentist's appointment.
Did we go to the dentist today?
- Uh-huh.
-  Was it good?
- Mhm.
-  Good, what did you do?
- Um, they poked.
-  Yeah, did
they look at your teeth?
Good job.
Hey, it was kinda rough but
we got through it, right?
They looked at all your
teeth, and then they said
they looked really good, didn't they?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, do you want your juice in a cup?
- Yeah, juice cup.
- Okay.
Juice in a cup.
- Juicy cup!
-  I always wonder,
you're texting and
smiling at the same time.
- I swear I'm not on my
phone, Jared, all the time!
- Well, you're smiling
and texting so I'm like,
what could you possibly be
doing and I'm not involved.
You're smiling!
- I was writing back to
Britney's Instagram story,
because she's going to the
Black Panther and I said
"oh, we were gonna go too,
and then our plans changed,
and now Jared's gonna go."
- Which is true.
- That's okay, I don't care.
I mean, I care, I don't
wanna sound like I don't,
but, like, I'm good staying back.
- Yeah.
- We had a babysitter tonight
and we were gonna go to the movies,
but like a few hours ago I was just like
I think I'm just gonna stay
back with the kids tonight.
Because we've got a
sitter for tomorrow night,
and Calvin was kinda coughing a lot,
like Jackson was the other day,
I just felt like I just
needed to stay home.
So, that's what we're gonna do.
And they're happily
playing now downstairs.
- Oh my gosh, it's so funny,
I heard Jackson downstairs
was saying like, "you're so cute!"
"You're so cute!"
"You're so cute!"
to Calvin, and it was just--
- And then Calvin screamed,
'cause he's a turd.
- So, they're happily playing but
it's kinda my thing,
superhero movies, so...
-  Me too!
- I'm gonna go if that's okay.
- I'll go again, that's good.
- I'll go see it twice.
Great idea, Ellie!
 You're the best thinker.
- So while the kids are
being good for a minute
playing downstairs,
I am starting to go through
the thousands and thousands
of pictures that we have
had over the last ten years.
Making them into folders.
We have a 'Calvin' folder,
we have a 'Calvin Baby' folder.
'Cousin' folder, 'friends',
'house', 'Jackson',
'Jackson Baby', 'Penny', 'pregnancy',
and I'm going through thousands of photos,
probably only a hundred while
the kids are somewhat happy.
And, putting them in the folders
so I can make these into a book.
And, I just wanted to
show you guys this picture
I put under 'pregnancy' and then
I put under 'family' as well.
And this photo was the
photo that Jarred and I
talked about doing an IVF grant.
That is the time that we had talked about
that we had wanted to do it.
We didn't know if it would
be five years down the road,
ten years down the road.
And now, looking back,
I had no idea that we would
be able to do two ourselves
in that amount of time
and I'm very grateful
and I'm glad that we are finally
going through these photos
and organizing them, and just
the memories that pop up.
Just, holy cow that seemed forever ago,
and now I'm pregnant
with a little other baby.
It's just like, what.
I couldn't imagine life with another baby,
It was just weird, it was
like Jackson's our everything
and then we had Calvin and our
love definitely multiplied.
We didn't have to divide our love.
It just, your love grows.
It's amazing how, how it does that.
I used to think,
when it was just Jared and I,
I just thought "how am I gonna
love a baby as much as I love Jared?"
Like, I really thought that.
And, I knew, and I always felt at peace,
'cause it's like I know that like
you adjust and life is great.
But it was hard sometimes really,
thinking about that.
But now that Jackson and Calvin are here
it's like, I love all three
of my boys equally as much.
Your love multiplies
and looking back at that photo is crazy.
So, it's gonna be fun going
through all of these photos,
I'm sure I'm gonna boo and cry.
(screams) I just exited out of them!
Jared just left.
As if I need to take any more pictures,
because I've already
gone through two hundred
and I still have thousands to go through.
I just spent a little bit
of time with the kids.
We played, read stories,
and they're in bed
talking a little bit
before they fall asleep.
 And of course,
they are happy as can be.
And I was like "Calvin, go
put your head on your pillow!"
And Jackson's like "no,
he likes to cuddle me."
I'm like "okay."
They go to bed so well.
Having our kids share a room
has been the best thing
for the whole house.
And they have slept better,
we have slept better.
They go to bed happy and
they talk, and they laugh.
It's just a fun experience.
I love sharing a room with my siblings,
and they won't always share a bed,
for sure I wanna get bunk beds.
I just really wanted to make
sure this would work out.
I would have hated to buy bunk beds
or even change up their room a little bit
and have Jackson be like
"no I don't love this"
or it be a hot mess.
But so far it's been so good.
I love our night time routine of cuddles
and hugs and reading books.
I had someone come and we measured outside
for some screens for in the
summer to put on the patio.
So I spent a lot of time this
afternoon outside measuring,
making sure things would
fit and work out for that.
I'm gonna go continue
to go through pictures,
I've been loving going
through the pregnancy photos
of me being pregnant
with Jackson and Calvin.
Just seeing, like, my body
change and my face change.
My thoughts when I was pregnant
then versus my thoughts now
and how I've changed as a
person it's been really fun
to, like, look back.
But I'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog.
Jared's on his date night.
I'm on my date night.
I ordered a sandwich.
So, I'm eating my sandwich
and I'm getting ready for bed.
So, I hope you guys had an awesome day.
We will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
- You didn't think the vlog
was over just yet, did you?
My dad and I just got back
from seeing Black Panther,
and it was awesome.
I just left a tweet saying
my, like, short review.
Character development was great,
the new world was awesome.
The villain vas really, really cool.
The whole story was really, really great.
Definitely recommend it.
There are some predictable
themes in the movie
but I don't feel like that takes away
from the overall quality and
awesomeness of the movie.
Definitely check out Black Panther.
'Kay, thanks for watching, bye.
