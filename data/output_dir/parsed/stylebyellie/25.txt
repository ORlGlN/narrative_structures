- Thank you for purchasing your ticket
to the live action play.
- Our very last private meeting.
(screams)
- Secret meeting--
-  Who's gonna fight me?
- Good morning, guys.
I'm getting my hair done.
I need to get freshened up.
I'm not really gonna do anything crazy,
I never really do with my hair.
So just a little trim today, and a little
touch-up on the roots.
You slept so good!
I'm proud of you.
Say hi to our friends.
- Hi, friend.
- Good morning! (chuckles)
How are you?
Hi, Jacks.
-  Hi.
- You slept so good, too!
- Look in the mirror if I see boogers.
- (laughs) Any boogers?
- Yep.
- Oh, dang it, gotta get 'em out.
- Hi.
- Hi, Jare.
-  Hi, Mom.
-  How was your workout?
- Good.
Hey!
-  Brutal?
- Oh my gosh, Ellie.
It was tough, but I'm good.
We did these crow
positions, like yoga stuff.
- Yeah.
- And I was like the only
person who could do it,
and I've never done it before.
- What?! Show me.
- Well, I don't know if I
can do it now, but I'll try.
And you hold it for two minutes.
-  Wow.
That's cool! (laughs)
- And anything that I had
left with my hip is gone.
I need to go to the hospital. (laughs)
- Ready for the owie?
-  Do you have an owie, too?
-  Yeah.
-  I have an owie.
Oh my gosh, this is like, the worst pain.
I'm trying to think of what
else has hurt really bad.
After having a baby.
So I had my ingrown toenail taken out,
and she said it's going
to be super, super sore,
and the doctor was very correct.
It has been super, super sore to walk on.
I'm just soaking it
right now in epsom salt,
and I'm just like biting my cheeks,
just being like, just maybe another week
and it'll be better.
(groans, laughs)
Put the heater vent on, Calvin.
-  Don't put my knife in it,
don't put my knife in it!
-  He won't.
'Kay, go put the kid knife away, okay?
You're just trying to fix
stuff around the house?
'Kay, Calvin, look at Mom.
Go put it away.
I'll soak it and then I'll show you guys.
And I'm warning you now if you don't want
to see, you can just skip.
'Kay, warning shot.
After soaking my foot for 20
minutes, it looks much better.
It was not very appealing
when I took the Band-Aid off.
But see how deep that's
cut out, and how far?
Like, it's just raw, and
super sore to walk on.
And it's done!
I just got a little trim and touched up
my roots a little bit.
This was the last hair
appointment that I have.
Well, I have one more hair
appointment until I have baby.
So, the beginning of June, I
have my next hair appointment,
and then a few weeks later,
I have baby! (screams)
It was weird booking it, I was like, okay,
gonna be really big, I'm
gonna be really swollen,
really uncomfortable, and
I'll get my hair fresh
for the month and that
will feel so good in June.
This salon is so awesome,
they always have bath bombs.
I don't care what bath,
any bath bomb is amazing,
so I grabbed a handful for the boys
because they always steal my bath bombs,
so me and the boys have some bath bombs.
- Behind this door is
something very, very cool,
and I'm excited to show you.
Let's go inside.
Ellie is waiting for us.
(beep)
- We had our very last, after a year,
our very last private meeting! (screams)
- Secret meeting from everybody.
- On March 5th, you guys will know.
I can't, it's been amazing,
but we've had meetings
all afternoon, can't wait
to go home, kiss my babies.
- So in order to celebrate
this monumental occasion
of having our last secret meeting,
we are having a little dessert!
Celebration.
- A pig out.
- Yeah. (laughs)
We've got cookies and ice cream,
waffle fries, and doughnuts.
Oh man. Our next project should
be like how to lose weight.
- You worked out this
morning, so we're good.
- Oh yeah, yeah, it cancels it out, yeah.
(Calvin yells)
(boys grunting)
-  Yay!
(Ellie laughs)
-  A new competitor
has entered the battlefield!
-  'Kay, last chance,
we'll see if Calvin can win it.
- Three, five!
-  Oh, oh, Penny got Calvin down!
(laughs)
- Who's gonna fight me?
- Me!
- Let's do it.
All the way back there.
- Three, five!
(Jared grunts)
-  Dad wins, like always!
-  I'll protect you!
I'll protect you from her!
I'll protect you, I'll protect you!
So most of the kid's pajamas
are in the dirty laundry,
so we have to make do with what we have.
So we are busting out these guys.
Can anyone tell me what these shirts are?
-  Nemo.
-  Nemo, you guys are gonna be
Finding Nemo buddies today.
Do you remember when we got these shirts?
-  My Nemo!
-  Yeah!
Actually, swap 'em.
This one's Calvin's, and
that one's Jackson's.
We got these when we went on the big,
big Disney boat on the Disney cruise.
Yeah, that one's yours.
Do you guys remember going
on the Disney cruise?
- Yeah.
- That was so much fun.
We had such a blast, in
fact, we have a playlist
of our Disney cruise.
I'll have that linked in the iCard,
and down below so you guys
can see the whole cruise
if you guys haven't seen that just yet.
Let's get in our pajamas, and
we'll do a little Nemo song.
Little Nemo dance, a
little Nemo sleepy time.
Got it? Oh, you're already
in character, perfect.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
thank you for purchasing your ticket
to the live action play of Finding Nemo!
(kids cheering)
We've got a wonderful cast here, we've got
Jackson playing Marlin,
and Calvin playing Nemo.
Are you guys ready?
- Yep.
- Okay. Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful family.
Nemo and Marlin.
Hi, I'm Marlin, I'm Nemo's dad.
Hi, I'm Nemo, I'm Nemo's, I'm
Marlin's son. (Calvin laughs)
Once upon a time, these two
fish loved each other very much,
but they had a complicated relationship
because this guy wanted
to go out and explore,
and this guy was kinda sensitive
because of previous events.
This guy touched the
butt, and then this guy
started looking for him,
because he didn't want him
to touch the butt.
And then this guy, who
got captured by the butt,
or rather the people in the butt,
and then this guy went looking for him.
He ended up in a tank with
a crazy girl with braces,
and you traveled far across
the sea with turtles,
and sharks, and all other kinds of fish.
And then you found each other.
The end! Yay!
(kids cheering)
(Calvin and Jackson babbling)
Good job, Nemos. (laughs)
Now we're destroying the stage.
It's all part of the, you
know, the price of admission.
I know the tickets were very expensive,
so thank you guys for
supporting us in this action.
And the stage is gone.
- This one.
- Uncle Ryan and Aunt Maria.
- This one?
- Uncle Nate, Uncle Nate
and Aunt Eva and Elwyn.
(Calvin laughs)
- Jackson is reading
Calvin our family book
that I think Uncle Nate and Aunt Megan
made a couple Christmases ago.
It's just so sweet, so they flip through
and they see the whole
family, at that point,
that they can get to know the names,
and pictures, and it's
just a really fun book
for little kids.
And they're going to sleep now.
That's all, we're done, yes!
I don't look very good?
-  Mm-hmm.
- Oh, geez.
- I said, "What's wrong?"
He's like, "Well, let me
tell you on the vlog."
- Been in my office for
the past little while,
and I'm at the point of
the day, or something,
I really don't even know
what I'm saying right now.
I'm so tired that I don't know
what I'm doing in the office.
Like, I sat in my chair, and I was like,
"What was I supposed to be doing?"
And I sat there for like 10 minutes.
- Do you want to just come to bed?
Do you want a grape?
- Yeah, I do.
I was like, I think Jared,
it's just time to bed.
Just put it away, you
can save it for tomorrow.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.
We had a good day today.
-  Oh, of course.
- It's been a great, busy, fun day.
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
-  No.
- The best thing in the
world is to be completely
exhausted after, like, a
good day of work, you know?
- Totes.
-  Yeah, totes magotes.
We've had a good secret last meeting, huh?
- I'm sorry, I know it's
annoying for you guys,
but obviously, we just, it's
been a year in the making,
and it's just we just have to be quiet
until it's like a legit thing. (laughs)
- Yeah. Well, speaking of,
it almost is a legit thing.
And if you want to find out exactly when
it is a legit thing, check
the link in the description.
You can find out with
that link exactly when
all of this is coming...
-  To fruition.
- To fruition.
To your eyeballs.
- I have a question.
The Bachelor.
They usually don't say,
like, "I love you,"
but I feel like the last few seasons,
the person tells many
people that they love them,
and then it confuses the
heck out of everyone.
-  Yeah.
- I used to think that was a
rule, but I guess it's not.
- Rules are made to be broken.
-  'Kay, come to bed.
-  'Kay, all right.
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you guys, and we
will see you next time.
Bye!
