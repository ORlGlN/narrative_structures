-  I find it very weird
to have so many emotions.
To be peaceful, but to be angry,
but to feel calm.
-  God puts rainbows in the clouds,
so that each of us in the
dreariest and the dreadest
of days, can still see a glimmer of hope.
-  Continue to hold,
and I will be with you shortly.
- I find it very weird
to have so many emotions.
To be peaceful, but to be angry,
but to feel calm, but
then to not feel calm
and be very frustrated.
There's just so many emotions that I have,
and it's just really hard to
even understand that myself.
But I'm sitting in bed,
because I'm starting to be really crampy.
I went to my doctor's office today
and they poked me a bajillion times,
they got a lot of blood work done.
They're gonna do a little bit of testing.
And they got me on some medicine as well.
A D&C is the last option
that me and the doctors want to do.
There's some complications
that can come with that,
especially because I am young.
So naturally or this way was the options
that we chose,
and so I'm laying in bed
just kind of starting
to feel crampy.
And Jared and the kids have
just been so cute and tender.
Calvin actually isn't feeling very well.
He has a fever.
I think it might be his
two year old molars.
But they've just been
cute and cuddly and clingy
and Jared's got me food.
And I've watched a few shows,
but I'm just like so over it.
I finished one of my books
and now I'm going to be reading
Change Through His Grace by Brad Wilcox.
I Instagrammed this, and a lot of people
said they love this author.
I've actually never read a book from him,
so I'm excited to.
And I also am not one to read,
and I've said that before.
I love listening to books,
that's my favorite way.
And someone said, I'm sad
that you think that Ellie.
Reading is peaceful and
it's really nice to do.
And every time I read, I love it,
but I don't know why I
don't do it more often.
And I feel like this
might put me in that mode
to start reading a lot more,
because I have enjoyed
Because sometimes when
you're listening to something
you still grab your phone,
you're looking around,
but reading it's just like
you're in your moment,
you're reading what's written,
you're not being distracted,
and I've really enjoyed
that the last few days,
just sitting quiet for
an hour and just reading.
An hour, just however long I can.
But Jared's with the kids right now,
and I'm just like resting, so.
I really appreciate Jared,
he is one of a kind.
(toy car buzzing)
Did Dad fix it for you?
- Uh-huh.
-  Does it work outside?
- Yeah, let me show you.
-  Oh, okay.
Is it working?
-  Uh-huh.
-  Cool.
- I'm an awesome dad.
(Ellie laughs)
There's few moments where I'm like,
I'm a good dad.
And that was one of them.
-  What did you do?
- I took it apart and I fixed it
(Ellie laughs)
from the inside.
-  Matt would be very proud of you.
(tender guitar music)
Should I close my eyes?
-  Yeah.
- That tickles, tell me when.
- Open your eyes.
(gasps)
- That's so pretty.
-  Yes it is?
- Who gave those to us?
-  I don't know yet, read the card.
- Aww, that was so sweet.
-  They're gorgeous.
- I never realized how
much I love flowers,
honestly.
- Hey Mom?
- What?
- Does this scare you?
- That doesn't scare me.
- Aww Michelle.
-  That's sweet.
- Ellie, I knew nothing I would say
would make anything better,
but just know that I'm here
for you if you need someone.
Praying for you and your sweet family.
You're such a light in the world.
Michelle Peterson, thank you.
That's sweet.
I think people say that a lot,
like, I don't know what I could say,
but I think even something
simple like that,
is very sweet.
- Absolutely.
- You know?
- ]Cause sometimes even though
people are going through
something, sometimes you feel very alone.
Like my last miscarriage
I felt very alone,
even though I know I wasn't.
And I think I feel,
if you could feel better,
but I feel a little better
about this one for some reason.
-  Yeah, absolutely.
- And I'm so grateful for
everyone that's been so sweet.
- I think one of the best things
that someone can do for you
is just letting them know
that you're there for them.
Sometimes words mean everything.
But knowing that you have someone there,
can be everything.
And my sweet brother Matt,
like, they know exactly
what we've gone through.
Ruby knows exactly what
we've gone through.
-  So many of our family members.
- So many of our family members
have gone through these miscarriages.
And Matt's just like, if
you just need to talk,
let me know.
Thank you Matt.
And I think just knowing, like this,
just having someone say that they're there
if you need them, I
think is very very sweet,
so thank you to all those.
I was saying outside,
that white truck out there
has come to our house a lot,
and I almost know the guy by name now,
so thank you to everyone
who has sent us some things.
My mom came over yesterday
and she made something
for Ellie and I'd like to show that.
- It's like right now,
like it comes in waves,
and it's like right now,
I'm not feeling anything.
But I was 10 minutes ago.
And especially with the medicine,
I definitely will tonight.
And it's like we, we are
having a miscarriage.
-  Yeah.
- We got pregnant,
and I just want to tell
Jared how much I love him.
When I came out of my doctor's office,
he was in the kids area with the kids,
and I was like where's dad,
and he was in the
corner, just, I love you.
-  I love you.
- I know this is hard on you too.
- It is, it is hard on me,
but having someone there.
I've got you by my side and
you've got me by my side.
- And baby, we're gonna
cry in each other's arms.
- Speaking of, so I was just slumped down
in the corner, in the kid's playroom,
holding back the tears.
And then Ellie walks in
and she's got a bandage
on this arm and a bandage on this arm,
because they couldn't
find the vein, I was like,
oh to add insult to injury,
they're just sticking you with needles
all over the place.
I felt bad, but
- Crazy.
-  I'm glad we have each other.
(thoughtful atmospheric music)
I think one of the hardest things
about having a miscarriage
is you essentially go through it twice.
First when you find out that
you're having a miscarriage
and then when you physically
go through the pain
of having the miscarriage.
First is the emotional pain
and then the physical pain.
And that's a lot of what Ellie's
been going through tonight.
She's been going through
a lot of pain right now.
And she's finally getting some rest.
It's been a difficult night for her,
but she is very strong
and she is very resilient
and I'm so grateful for
her and for her example.
There's a lot of stuff that's going on
in the world today that
can cause us a lot of pain.
My hometown had a school shooting,
like that is crazy to me.
And it's just a hard
time to be in the world.
But Maya Angelou said
that God puts rainbows
in the clouds, so that each of us,
in the dreariest and the dreadest of days
can still see a glimmer of hope.
And I believe that,
that even in the darkest of days,
that we can still see some hope.
And there's so many different ways
that we can feel that hope.
And I wanted to ask you guys,
what you guys do,
when you're feeling down,
when you need that little glimmer of hope.
What brings that to you?
I hope that even in the
midst of these things,
the trials that we face,
the things that we go through,
that we can be a little bit of
hope and light for you guys.
That's something that
we've always enjoyed doing,
is bringing smiles to peoples' faces
and hope to people.
And I hope that we can
continue to do that.
I just, despite all of
the stuff that's going on,
I still have so much
gratitude in my heart,
for my kids, for my family,
and for all of those who have spent
so much time and effort to put smiles
on our faces.
We've had so many people bring flowers
and cookies, and all of that to us,
and it's made Ellie smile,
so thank you.
It's made us smile.
Thank you for doing that.
We really do appreciate it.
I hope you guys have a wonderful day.
And we will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
