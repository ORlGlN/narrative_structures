Joel and I are taking a taxi alone
for the very first time.
Guy's trip.
(chuckles) We're going
to DJI, we've never been,
we've never called a taxi.
We've never done this
before, so here's to hoping
we get to where we want
to go for the first time.
We're gonna make it.
Score one for the Americans, we did it!
We're here.
Amazing Race, here we come.
I know, right?
We should do The Amazing Race.
We're gonna, this is it.
I think we're amazing, and we were racing.
-  Mm-hmm.
Amazing Race.
Our flight today leaves in a few hours,
but we wanted to make one
more stop before we left.
Joel and I are...
-  DJI.
Visiting a cool company today.
I feel like I'm a kid in a candy store.
I really, really do.
Like, look, they've got the drones,
they've got all the
history of all of DJI here.
I wanna show you this one here,
this is blowing my mind.
This is the Flame Wheel, this is like
the first drone that they made.
It was like a kit that you put together.
It wasn't even out of the
box, you just fly the drone.
And that was in 2012, like five years ago.
That's where drones were.
And they've got all their new
stuff out here on the front.
Like these, this giant drone, the Osmos,
the Ronins, the Sparks, the DJI Goggles,
the Mavic, the Inspire 2,
the Obsidian Phantom 4 Pro.
This is so crazy, but what
blows my mind the most...
We are the first American
creators to be here.
The first ones.
No other creator, like YouTuber, has been
in this DJI place, this
building, except Joel and I.
And so they're telling us, they're like,
that means a lot to us,
so thank you for coming.
I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is so cool,
"we're coming again."
But, ah, this is awesome.
Even when we had a translator,
sometimes it just would
get lost in translation,
especially when we went
to fast food places.
I'm very particular when
it comes to my hamburgers.
I just like ketchup, cheese, and lettuce.
And so I got a Whopper, and I told them
no pickles, no tomatoes, no mayonnaise.
Just ketchup and lettuce.
And so, it's like an unboxing video,
I'm like, super excited to see
what actually showed up on here.
But what I love about watching Jared
is no matter where he has gone,
you have always made them laugh.
(Jared laughs)
So either they're laughing at you,
but I think they were--
I have no idea.
-  But I think they
were totally laughing with you.
'Cause you guys high-fived.
-  Ah, look at that!
-  Awesome!
They're perfect.
There's no lettuce,
but I'm okay with that.
(Ellie chuckles)
That works great.
You know what you do,
here's the thing you do.
Take some fries, throw it on there.
-  Layer it up.
-  Mm-hmm.
-  So they still
got your order wrong?
A little bit.
You know what that makes me feel like?
-  What?
I'm back in the States.
(Jared laughs)
(bright guitar music)
Done with one plane, onto the next!
Well, after we wait for six hours.
We have a six hour layover.
Here we go!
Six hours!
Six hours.
Bye bye!
 Six hours later.
(guitar music)
Good morning!
I am with my babies!
I'm gonna still crack some eggs.
-  You wanna crack more?
Yeah.
-  Let's, I think--
Oh, oop, did you tootie? (chuckles)
I don't think we need anymore.
Can you mix it a little more?
And then we'll make them.
We'll make the pancakes.
Last night when Jared and I got home,
both the boys woke up.
Calvin's over there playing toys.
And they slept in our
bed, and it was so fun
greeting them last night.
We cuddled, we talked, we told
them how much we missed them,
and then they woke up
pretty early this morning,
so we're making pancakes.
Yeah, for me!
Um, um, um!
(Ellie laughs)
-  For you.
And then we'll go wake Daddy up
when we're done eating, 'kay?
You bring something cool for me?
We did, we told Jackson, we called him,
and Calvin, he's over there playing.
I said we'll bring you something,
I want you to be really good
for Grandma and Grandpa,
and guess what?
What?
-  You were so good.
You'd go to bed, and
you listened good, huh?
Do you think you were good?
What did you bring me?
-  Let's eat,
and then we'll show you.
'Kay?
Okay.
-  'Kay.
I missed you so much!
Oh, some of them fell out.
-  That's okay.
Calvin, hi.
Hi.
-  (chuckles) Did
you help me break eggs?
Did you break the eggs with us?
Yeah.
-  Yeah, should we eat?
Yeah.
-  Okay.
Do you wanna wake Daddy up?
Let's go wake him up, but be really nice.
-  Daddy.
-  Go get Dad.
-  Dad, I want
you to show me the prize.
(Ellie laughs)
-  You do?
Good morning, guys.
-  Good morning.
We just ate pancakes for breakfast.
-  You did?
Was it so good?
Yeah.
Can I see the prize now?
-  You want the
surprise so bad, don't you?
-  He waited so long, huh?
-  Yes he did.
-  Look, I wanna show what Jackson
made us while we were gone.
-  Look at Calvin look at my face.
(Ellie laughs)
Dad, Dad, Dad.
Dad, we drawed your name.
-  You did? Oh my goodness.
Look, Grandma and Grandpa.
-  That's so good.
It was Grandma Griffi--
Grandma Mecham.
-  Where's Daddy?
I didn't draw you.
-  Oh, okay.
-  But where's Mama?
Right here.
-  (gasps) It's so good!
Don't rip it!
(Ellie and Jared chuckle)
-  Mommy.
-  Yeah, that's Mommy.
-  Can we put this away for you?
-  Yes, thank you.
Now, I wanna get my prize now!
Okay.
Yay!
(Ellie laughs)
-  Are you gonna
bring me something?
-  My!
-  (chuckles) Stay here.
Are you just waiting patiently?
Mm-hmm.
(Ellie laughs)
That's Jackson's favorite thing to do,
is just close his eyes.
Wait, gotta wait.
Close your eyes!
We've got a few surprises.
Don't you sneak peek,
don't you sneak peek!
We've got a few surprises for ya.
-  (gasps) Me?
So Mommy and Daddy, we went to a village
when we were on the boat.
Do you remember when we were on the boat?
And they make things there...
(Calvin babbles)
and we saw some things
that we think you'd like,
so I want to show you those first.
-  Okay.
Ready?
-  Yep.
Open your eyes.
What?!
-  Do you know what these are?
-  Yeah, drums!
-  Yeah.
(patting)
-  Is that cool,
that they made this.
-  Yeah, they made that.
-  See all that on there?
(Calvin babbles)
This is something really cool.
-  What is that?
This is a flute.
(flute whistles)
You did it.
You can try--
Oh!
(flute whistles)
Yay!
Don't blow too hard.
(Ellie and Jared laugh)
-  Jackson, when we saw this,
we thought of you and we thought
you would love it so, so much, 'kay?
'Kay.
-  Ready?
-  Yep.
Bum ba da bum.
-  What?!
(Ellie and Jared chuckle)
Look.
What is this?!
This is a remote control
car that is Spider-Man
on one side, and look...
Captain America on the other.
Is this the Spider-Man?
Uh-huh, and look, it can
go up walls like that,
and it'll flip over, and you keep driving.
(gasps) My dog?
Yeah, it's a dog for you, that's right.
This is a nightlight for your bedroom.
-  Oh, it a
nightlight just like mine.
Yeah, and it's a doggy, but look, watch.
You see it light up?
Look.
-  Whoa.
-  Do you see that?
-  It glows up too?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh, you see
the Spider-Man glowing?
We missed you boys so, so much.
(muah)
We are so happy (muah) to be home.
We love you, love you, love you, love you!
-  I can't wait to hear about all
about their trip.
That's kind of fun, if Mom and Dad leave,
especially for a long time, to come home
with some fun gifts, huh? (laughs)
(flute whistles)
-  Dad, let's
go get some batteries.
-  Okay.
-  Hey, do you like that?
Yeah.
-  Let's hear it.
Oh, did you hit your eye?
Yeah.
-  Owie.
(flute whistles)
When Jackson woke up, he was on the couch,
and loved on us, loved us
hugging and kissing him.
And then Calvin had woke up in his room,
and when I walked in he...
And then he put his hand
up, and touched my face.
And I was like, "Mama's home."
(both laugh)
Yeah, Jackson was so sweet
because the first thing
he said, he said, "Do you
have a surprise for me?"
And I said yes.
'Cause we would, we
told him if he was good,
we'd bring one.
And I said, "Let's wait until
we wake up in the morning."
He said, "Okay."
(Ellie laughs)
So mature, he didn't want it right then,
he's like, "I just want to hold you."
And he just hugged us, and oh!
So we all slept over in our bed,
and then they woke up at the
butt crack of dawn. (laughs)
How are you feeling?
I was really tired when I woke up,
I feel like I'm pretty good now.
-  Yeah, yeah.
But yeah, I'm glad that we got home,
and we were able to go straight to bed.
-  Yeah.
And slept for six hours,
so I feel like that's
going to help us quite
a bit with the jet lag.
Awesome. We're home!
We went to China, and now we're back!
(drumming)
So Grandma Griffiths just called me.
Oh, don't eat my hoodie! (chuckles)
And guess what she said?
Hmm?
She said that yesterday in the car,
that Calvin was crying in
the car, and he was tired,
and he was saying, "Mama!"
Your lip was quivered, and
you were starting to cry.
And he said, "It's okay, Calvin.
"Mom and Dad will be home soon."
And was like trying not
to cry, did that happen?
You were so brave for Calvin.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you for taking care of him.
Mm-hmm.
And this is pretty much
what we've done all day.
We've kissed, we've been
eating, he's eating cereal,
dry cereal right now.
This is what we've been doing.
We've been home, it's in the evening now,
and it is like in the
morning-ish in China.
So, it's like completely flip-flopped.
And I have felt much better
than I thought I would.
We're obviously really tired,
because our time change
has totally been flipped,
we just traveled 30 hours,
just getting off of, like, being busy.
But I feel better than I thought I would.
Especially now that it's
getting more into the evening.
Around noon and one I was really sluggish,
didn't want to do laundry,
but knew I had to get it done.
We had like no underwear.
So we're washing loads of
laundry, we're cuddling, kissing.
It's just been a really good day back.
Jared has more energy than he should.
There's a mess in the kitchen.
Or in the living room, on the carpet.
I think it's water, so I think
we're okay. (Ellie laughs)
But I can't tell, I need your nose.
It might be juice.
Jared's parents came over
today for us to talk about...
Well, let's see, where's the juice?
(gasps) There it is.
-  He's standing on it!
He's trying to cover
up his tracks. (laughs)
-  Where's the bottle?
-  I can't find it.
-  That's my fault.
No, sit down, sit down.
Yeah, I think it's Gatorade, dang it!
That's my fault, argh!
Calvin, that was naughty.
That made me really mad.
Don't do that.
Okay, well we're going to clean that up.
Totally my fault, left that out and open.
Jared's parents came over earlier today,
and we were telling them how our trip was.
Literally, we looked away
from Calvin for, like,
one minute, and he was up on the counter,
he had taken the chocolate
mix to make chocolate milk,
had it all over his
face, all over the floor.
Buddy!
You missed your bagoo! (laughs)
Oh yeah, he's like, "Oh yeah,
that was fun, it was good."
-  'Kay, go clean up,
that's our favorite by the way.
Best carpet cleaner ever.
Oh, it's wet!
-  (laughs) Come here.
It's off.
Now try it.
Do you want me to dab it
first, or spray it first?
I think maybe dab it and then spray it.
Jared brought home some Chinese money,
and the kids are gonna put
it in their piggy banks,
so they have some money in there.
Help Dad.
Take this rag, and dab
it on the mess, 'kay?
Can you do that?
Like this.
-  (laughs) He just farted.
(Calvin and Jared chuckle)
Can you do that?
Can you push it down on it?
There you go, there you go.
-  Good job.
Good helper.
'Kay, push hard.
-  Good job, bud.
I'm just glad it's not pee.
(Ellie chuckles)
(Calvin shouts)
-  Jackson, do you
want to let Penny out now?
Or are you still webbing her up?
-  Yeah.
-  (chuckles) He took
his spiderwebs and webbed her.
(laughs)
Well it's not very often that
Spider-Man asks to go to bed.
I was putting Calvin to
bed, and I told Jackson,
"Play for a minute while
I get Calvin to sleep,
"and then I'll put you to bed."
And he came in while I
was putting Calvin to bed,
and he laid down, and he goes,
he goes, "Can you just put me to bed now?"
I was like, so I had him lie on my lap
while I put Calvin to bed,
and now you're ready for bed.
He is, like, tired.
You'll sleep good tonight, huh?
Now when Mommy and Daddy are home, huh?
'Kay.
It has been a huge day
of playing catch up.
I have been working all
day long in the office,
and Ellie's been with the
kids, playing with them.
We all have been playing with them,
picking up Penny, it's
just been a great day,
but it's been a very, very busy day.
The jet lag, I'm actually really surprised
it has not got me at all.
Like, I feel great, I feel like I got
a good night's sleep last night.
But one person it has got is Ellie.
(chuckles)
They are so cute.
No joke, that is the third time
I have caught Ellie falling asleep.
And I have felt much better
than I thought I would.
Once in the bedroom, once on
the couch, once downstairs.
It's nine o'clock--
(cup clatters in background)
That was close.
It's nine o'clock at night,
which is understandable,
she's really, really tired.
So I think we're going to call it a night.
We are back from China.
It feels so good to be at home,
to breathe the cool, crisp mountain air.
To have Penny home,
she is such a good dog.
To be with the kids.
I swear, these kids have just
like grown up and matured,
like, hearing the story from
Ellie's mom about Jackson
in the car saying, you
know, "Don't cry, Calvin,
"Mommy and Daddy will be home soon."
Like, oh it just pulls at my heartstrings.
And when Jackson, when we saw him,
he was like, "I wanna see my surprise,
"but I'll wait 'til morning."
It was so cute.
So Jared and I are going to bed right now,
and I was telling him,
like, how good I felt today,
and I don't feel a jet
lag, and he was like,
"Ellie, you're totally jet
lagged, you keep falling asleep."
(both laugh)
So I am, I think we all are,
how could you not, you know?
I mean, I feel pretty good.
I haven't fallen asleep,
I've been going all day.
You have done really good.
Yeah.
I think I just thought,
I've never experienced it,
like, I thought with jet
lag, you would feel really,
really sick for some reason.
I don't know.
Yeah, I mean you would get,
like, headaches, and you just feel woozy,
and that sort of thing.
Yeah.
And so that's why I'm
like, I'm doing good!
'Cause I feel good,
other than being tired.
But yep, I've fallen
asleep several times today.
-  It's all about being tired.
-  Yeah, so I guess totes.
Hi, Miss Penny.
(both laugh)
Hi, pretty girl.
-  Are you happy to be home?
-  Yeah, pretty girl.
-  Yes, we missed you so much.
(Ellie laughs)
Just wanted to add that tidbit, I'm like,
okay, I totally am jet
lagged, I just thought
that I would be sick, you know.
'Kay, I'm Marco Poloing
my sister. (laughs)
I guess it's an app that
she keeps telling me to get,
so I'm talking to Julie right now.
So I'll see you guys later.
Bye.
Bye!
