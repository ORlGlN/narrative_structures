- Are you ready for the news?
(Ellie laughs)
It's aaaa--
(laughing)
(clapping)
(bright music)
You have to take a bite,
and then you'll know the gender.
Ready?
At the same time, you have
to do it at the same time.
(yelling and laughing)
-  I'm so glad
you answered the phone
during your ultrasound.
- Ah good!
(gasps)
(laughing)
(bright music)
- Good morning guys.
Today is a very exciting day,
and I'm gonna tell you why.
Today is the day that
I get to surprise Ellie
and let her know if we're
having a boy or a girl.
(bright music)
Not only that, we get to tell
the rest of our family what
we're having today too.
But before we do that, I've
got to run to the store
and grab a few things
in order to tell Ellie a proper way.
(beep)
I got what I need.
And the most important
thing is right here.
In this envelope are the results
of genetic testing that we did.
After these miscarriages,
we wanted to check everything.
And in those genetic tests are the gender.
And I'm going to open this right now,
find out what we're having
and then I'm gonna go home
and I'm going to surprise
Ellie with what we are having.
I'm starting to get butterflies.
(laughs)
I'm starting to get butterflies,
oh my goodness.
I've never done this alone,
but this is a different way
that we wanted to do it so,
here we go.
(laughing)
(clapping)
(bright music)
Oh!
Oh my gosh, Ellie is going to freak.
(laughing)
Oh my goodness gracious.
Oh my goodness gracious.
Woo hoo!
Okay, I've get home.
I've gotta tell my wife what we're having,
because now I know what we are having.
(laughs)
Let's go car, come on!
Hello.
-  You got the eggs?
- I've got everything we need.
Hi boys.
Hey, I have something
that I want to tell you.
- What?
- I know what we're having.
(laughing)
Yes Jackson,
we are having cupcakes.
- When did you look?
- We are having cupcakes.
- Yay.
-  When did I look?
- Yeah.
- That's a little secret, okay?
I have something for you
and I want to get it all set up
and then we'll go somewhere special
and we'll do this thing.
- And in the meantime, the kiddos and I
we are going to at least
going to start on the muffins.
-  Perfect.
-  Oh my gosh, I'm excited.
-  What do you think guys?
Boy or girl?
- Sprinkles sprinkle.
-  Sprinkles?
We've got blue sprinkles,
we've got pink sprinkles.
- We got them at Lee's.
-  Yeah, good.
- That's his favorite grocery store.
-  Yes it is.
Okay I'll be right back.
- I'm gonna give you one
and you can put it in.
Here.
It goes right here.
- Oh yeah.
- You want to put it here?
Put it here,
and I'm gonna do the next one.
(playful music)
- This is so cute.
Okay baby,
- Come sit right here.
- we officially will know now.
I just got a little bump.
Oh my gosh.
This is so cute.
- Okay.
- So instead of just telling you
what gender the baby is,
I wanted you to open up something
that is a gift that isn't just going to be
one and done, it's something
that you're going to have,
that we're going to have for awhile.
And I think we'll love it
and I think we'll put it to good use
and all of that sort of thing.
- That was so cute, I
think it went over my head.
(laughing)
(Ellie yelling)
- You are just so focused
on this right now.
- That's cute.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- That was thoughtful.
- Okay.
- Okay, wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait,
are you ready to find out?
- Tell me how you felt?
- I was so thrilled and excited.
I can't give away too much,
- Obviously.
because I'm on YouTube.
Open it up and see for yourself.
(gasps)
(laughing)
What do you think?
- Oh my crazy.
Oh my crazy, that's cute.
I knew.
(Jared laughs)
I knew.
- We're having a boy.
- This is cute.
My stomach is going a million
miles a minute right now.
- Three boys Ellie,
- I can't think.
- three boys.
- I'm outnumbered,
- Yes you are.
- a lot.
- You and Penny are gonna
have to fend for yourselves.
- I'm a good mama's boy.
- You're a good mama of boys.
- Yeah.
- I love you.
- I love you.
This is exciting.
- This is exciting.
- What are we gonna name him?
- I don't know, I was thinking about that
on the way home, like gosh--
- What are we going to name him?
We have talked about names and I--
- And we've already used
up two really good ones.
- Yeah, we've thought about
names, and we're like--
- We can't name him Jackson or Calvin.
- what are we gonna--
- How do you feel right now?
- I'm, the kids are gonna be ecstatic.
- Jackson is gonna freak out.
- All day he's like, but
if I put blue sprinkles
on it, it'll be a boy.
I'm like no.
(laughs)
- He's kind of right.
(laughing)
- Aww, what is he gonna look like?
- I don't know.
That's gonna be the crazy thing.
(laugh-yelling)
- Ahhh!
- I can't even believe it Ellie.
- I can't wait.
- These are little belly stickers
that show how many months old the baby is,
so we can take pictures.
- That's cute.
- So that will be fun.
And then this is a memory book,
and it's all about our
baby boy's adventure.
- Yes.
- So you'll have things like born date,
weight, photos, all of the information
and this will be cool for the baby to have
when they're adults.
- So cute.
- You know?
- So what we're doing now
is we're making cupcakes
with filling on the inside,
and now we know what color
the filling's gonna be.
So when they take a bike--
- I have butterflies still.
- They will know what we're having.
I have butterflies, this is insane.
- Three boys.
- This is so exciting.
(laughing)
- Love you.
- Love you.
- Love you.
- Hello baby boy.
- I don't know what I'm gonna name you.
I'm dying right now.
I can't even concentrate and think,
I'm just like scatterbrained.
I'm going to put the muffins in the tins
and I can't, I'm gonna show you guys.
I am excited.
So the boys have tons of shoes,
because Calvin's wearing
some of Jackson's,
but a lot of Calvin's little shoes
have hardly been worn.
Like these church shoes, I
think he wore them twice,
and then he flippin' grew out of them.
Look at those baby shoes.
Look at those baby shoes.
That this little boy is gonna be able
to pass down and wear.
My heart is going a
million miles a minute.
'Cause it's like I had Jackson,
and it's like what is he gonna look like?
And then I had Calvin
and now I'm like what possibly
could a third boy look like?
And then I think of my family
and how they have like three girls
or three boys and it's like
they all are so different,
and different personalities,
what is this little guy's
personality gonna be like?
This is gonna take a
good minute to sink in,
to really be like holy cow.
I mean even if it was a girl,
it would take a minute to just sink in.
This is crazy.
I cannot wait to tell our family.
(gentle music)
- Good job.
- Look.
- Turn it that way.
- Maybe I'm gonna do this side down.
- Woo!
- Good job.
- This is all they've been
wanting to do all day, guys.
These ones are for you and Calvin.
The inside color will tell you
if it's a boy or a girl.
- But I want it to be a boy.
- You're gonna find out.
- You want it to be a what?
- A boy.
-  So when you take a big bite
and you see the color in the middle,
that's gonna tell us if
we're having a boy or a girl.
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to eat it too.
- Let's watch Jackson.
- You want me to take it off?
- Mmm-hmm.
- And you cut it open?
- Yeah.
- Alright, give it to me.
- What?
What?
- What color?
- Blue!
- What does that mean is in Mommy's tummy?
- Blue, a boy!
- That's right.
- Are you gonna have a baby brother?
- Uh-huh.
- Calvin, did you hear that?
- You're gonna have a baby brother.
- You're a big brother.
- But we want another big brother.
- Another big brother?
You are gonna be a big brother.
- Again.
- So we're gonna have
a little tiny baby boy.
- Is that so exciting?
- Yeah.
- That's exactly what you wanted Jackson.
- I'm gonna eat those ones.
I can eat right here.
- What?
- I love you boys.
So here is the deal,
we have cupcakes right here for you guys
to bite into.
Inside the cupcakes is a filling
and the filling
- Okay, great, okay!
- is the color of the gender.
- Okay wait wait wait wait.
- You have to do it at the same time.
- We have to do this--
- No we don't,
no we don't!
- Yes we do!
-  Hurry, he's gonna get it!
(Ellie yells)
(laughing)
- We're having a baby brother.
- A boy.
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna be a big brother?
Yes you are!
- Yes you are!
- You're gonna be a big brother.
- No!
- I wonder if you're
following in Matt's footsteps.
- I know.
- I know, huh?
- We are like identical,
except I'm much better looking.
(laughing)
- Here's the deal, you
probably already know
the situation, but you got a cupcake,
inside the cupcake is filling
and the filling is the color of the gender
of the baby that we're having,
so you have to take a bite and
then you'll know the gender,
ready, at the same time,
you have to do it at the same time.
- I just want to rip it open.
- You can cut it if you want--
- I just want to rip it open!
It's a boy!
(laughing)
I knew it was going to be a boy.
- What does blue mean?
-  What does blue mean?
- I told Jared the same thing.
I said I think girl,
'cause it's different,
but my heart always goes back to,
no, I'm having a boy.
I am a mom of boys.
- We all have three boys,
that's so funny.
- It comes back to whatever you want,
you don't get.
(laughing)
I'm so excited to have
another Joel running around.
I mean I'm just kidding.
Or a Gregory.
-  Are you ready for the news?
It's aaaa--
- Boy!
- Boy!
(laughing)
- Oh really?
-  We like to
follow in your footsteps.
-  We are having a boy!
- Really?
-  Yeah.
(laughing)
- Are you really having another boy?
- Yeah.
- Another boy.
-  Three boys.
- What's up Ellie?
(Ellie laughing)
Did you find out what you're having?
-  Yes.
I'm so glad you answered the phone
during your ultrasound.
-  We just found
out like three seconds ago.
-  Oh my oh!
- What are you having?
-  I'm having a boy.
- Oh my gosh.
-  What are you having?
-  We are having--
Go ahead.
(signal tone)
- We're headed to Grandma Great's
and my Mom's house to
give them their cupcake.
We've spent the whole
day just making cupcakes,
being with the kids, going to family
and the more and more
the day has progressed,
the more I am just tickled--
-  Woo!
- and just can't stop
the smile off my face.
I grew up with a lot of girls.
And it was like the cluster of girls
and like I have a cluster of boys.
Jared grew up with a lot of brothers.
And I just keep thinking of the future
and how fun it's gonna be
and what adventures they
go on and it's just crazy.
Like this is crazy.
And I must be fit for boys.
(laugh-yelling)
- You are a mom of boys.
- I think it's so fun.
They're so cute.
Boys, like my boys they love me.
And it's like weird to say that out loud,
because it sounds kind of funny,
but like my boys love me
and I love that they do
and I can't wait to bring in another one.
- Well it's because
you're a good mom to them,
like no wonder they love you.
They love me too.
I'm not gonna shy away from this,
if we're giving ourselves compliments.
They love me too.
- Our kids are just very cuddly.
-  Yeah.
- And it's like I hope this next one wants
to cuddle as much,
and it'll be fun, I can't wait.
Oh my gosh!
Okay, we're gonna go see Grandma Great.
- Excited about Christmas?
Give me love.
Oh my goodness, oh.
Hi.
Hi how are you?
Good to see you guys, come on in.
- Well thank you.
- Your lights are cute.
- Yeah, your lights look great out there.
We found out what we're having.
- Oh you have?
- Yes.
- Really?
- And inside this cupcake is filling
and the filling is the color of the gender
of the baby.
- Oh my gosh, you kids.
- And would like you to either cut it open
with the knife or take a big bite.
Oh no!
To find out what we're having.
Whoops (laughs).
- I gotta cut it.
-  Okay.
- A boy.
- Yeah.
Another boy.
- Well I had put my order in for a girl,
- Oh didn't we all.
- but I love boys too.
I'll accept a boy.
(laughing)
-  The Mecham's are good at boys.
We found out what we're having today.
(gasps)
We're having another boy.
- Ah good!
-  Three in a row.
- Three boys!
-  We're having a boy.
- Oh my gosh.
Are you serious?
-  Yes.
- They're having a boy.
They have Jackson and
Calvin and another boy.
- His eyes.
- That's a lot of boys, huh?
-  We are having a boy.
- Well that's a big surprise, huh?
-  Yeah.
- 'Cause it's a boy.
- Boy!
(yelling)
- Jackson and Calvin are
gonna have a brother.
-  That's how I think too.
(laughing)
We are having a boy.
- Oh!
(Ellie laughing)
- Were you a little shocked?
-  I was shocked.
-  Whenever you want.
- But the answer
- This is exciting.
- is inside.
- is in the middle.
- This is exciting.
- Okay now, you just hold on--
-  You gotta do it
at the same time though.
- Okay, you gotta do it at the same time.
-  Unless you're Jared's mom,
she gets excited and just rips it.
- Okay you ready?
On 17, one, two--
(laughing)
Oh.
- No!
- That's funny.
- Oh that's funny, my three sons.
- Congratulations.
- Yep.
- Thank you.

- Can you imagine another little one?
- That's crazy.
- Another one.
- It's gonna be so cute.
- You boys are just gonna be--
- Check hard?
- We literally said that today.
Jared's like your dad's
gonna want to give him back.
(laughing)

- Today has been crazy.
- We're having a boy.
- I am speechless.

- I'm speechless.
Find a name.

- I literally have been on the couch
and I keep texting Jared,
and I have, and I remember
this name last time, Mason.
- Yeah.
- And you're like no,
but every time I read it, it sticks out.
- Huh?
- I really like the name Mason.
- That's interesting.
It's always to have fun to have names
that just like ring a bell.
- Yeah.
- Or like yeah, it's something
that resonates with you.
- Jackson, Calvin and Mason.
- Yeah.
- I think it's cute.
- Yeah, we got three boys.
- We'll have to see.
- Yeah.
I am so excited.
- I am too.
- I can't wait to get
newborn clothes again,
set up a room.
Penny's like rub my belly.
- Penny is right here
and she's making me rub
- Where she's sprawled out.
- her belly with my foot.
