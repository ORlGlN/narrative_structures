(bright bluesy music)
- Woo!
-  Yeah.
Put your arms in the air.
Happy Monday, happy Monday Penny.
Good morning, how are ya?
That's a good girl.
You're so excited for Monday.
May we all have the energy
of a one year old dog.
(laughs)
She is just so spunky and happy
just uh, what a good girl.
Looking outside, is Calvin
and Jackson out there?
Are they playing?
Are they riding their bikes?
They've been riding their bikes
maybe because it's a little warmer today.
It's a beautiful beautiful day.
So I think we're gonna take advantage
of the beautiful day
and spend time outside.
(bright groovy music)
-  Well hello boys.
- Hey hi.
-  Whatcha doin'?
- Oh I'm just
Landon needed some help, so he called me
to come over.
- Usually people call Joel,
because he puts holes in peoples' walls.
- And cuts himself up, it's ridiculous.
- We are somewhere new having fun
and eating fruit snacks with our cousins.
- If you're ready to
have a good time today,
raise your hands.
-  Woo!
- If you're ready to
go to a pumpkin patch,
raise your hand.
- Woo.
- I am.
-  If you're ready to
have a good time, say oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.
- Let's go!
So every year around Halloween,
we got to a place called Cornbelly's
and there's so many fun things to do
for the kids and for us.
If you remember, that's
where I went bull riding.
I got hurt.
But we got everyone here.
They opened 20 minutes ago
and two overflow parking lots are full.
It is crazy.
On Mondays in Utah it's family night,
so all these families
like to do stuff together.
And tonight is the night,
so there's a ton of people.
We're gonna have a blast.
We're gonna play, we're gonna have fun.
You guys ready to rock?
- Woo hoo!
- Yeah.
(bright bluesy music)
You and Julie are going
up with all the kids?
Good luck.
- Woo!
-  Yeah.
You almost got some air.
(Jared laughing)
Woo hoo!
Yeah!
-  Julie!
(Ellie laughs)
- The mama.
- Hey when I saw you and Julie up there,
I thought, oh, that's what they look like
on a date.
- Remember that one time Julie and I
went on a date?
- Yeah that was so fun.
- There was a picture of Julie on Facebook
the other day and Calvin looked at it
and goes Mama.
- Oh cute.
- I'm like, yeah.
- Yeah yeah Mama.
- This is fun.
- We're spending the evening with Julie,
we're hanging out with the kids.
- Such a good idea.
- And this is the biggest place here
it's called Corndolly's.
There's so many activities,
and we're getting ready to
go on a little train ride.
-  Can the adults do this?
-  I don't see why not.
You get it girl.
- Cow ride.
Put your hands in the air.
- Like you just don't care.
(tractor motoring)
Look at all these cows.
-  Moo!
(mooing)
Okay man, world cup first shot,
I'll buy you dinner.
- World cup?
-  World cup,
the top one in the left.
Stand back Jackson,
you're about to see something amazing.
- No!
(Jared laughing)
-  Poise, dedication, triumph, ooh,
ooh, aww.
The goalie got a red card,
so you have a second attempt.
- Here we go, world cup here I come baby.
-  Ooh that was so close.
Oh that was not (laughing).
(slow mo' laughing)
Don't worry, we'll work on
your ball handling skills.
Oh I got academy.
-  You got academy.
-  That was good.
Is that awesome that dad did that?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, kick it.
Yeah.
And this is a corn maze, okay?
We have to try and not
get lost in the corn maze.
Emma, are you gonna be our guide today?
- No.
-  No, okay.
- She's already lost and
she's not even in the maze.
(Jared laughs)
-  Should we got
this way or this way?
-  This way.
- Okay, let's go.
We're gonna try to sneak
and scare Aunt Julie.
Should we do that?
- Yeah.
- Oh this way, this way, this way.
Boogedy boogety boo!
- We're done.
(yelling)
- Jackson what way?
What way?
-  Calvin, where did you go.
Calvin?
Calvin, where is he?
There you are.
Calvin.
(laughing)
You got lost in the corn maze,
I couldn't find you.
(bright music)
-  Let's see Jare.
- You want to know how you know you had
a good time at the corn?
-  How?
(laughing)
-  I don't know
what's worse, that or Lego's.
- Calvin had just as much fun too.
It's getting a little chilly outside
and Calvin is wearing his Jacket
and his little hat.
And it it the cutest thing in the world.
I want to have it for myself.
Hi bud.
Are you gonna come down the slide?
- Boat.
-  The bell, the
boat, you're on a boat?
- That.
-  Yeah, come down the slide.
Yeah.
Yeah!
(Jared laughing)
Everyone is gathered around,
because they are shooting off a cannon,
full of candy, cash and toys.
And we're gonna try and get some, okay?
Are you gonna grab some Calvin?
Are you gonna grab some?
Okay.
I'm kind of nervous because
it's literally a giant cannon
shooting hard objects at
a huge group of people.
Cover your head, seriously.
- They said there's like pumpkins in it?
-  What?
- Yeah like little pumpkins.
-  Oh my gosh.
This is a little scary.
- Are we going home with
- black eyes and bloody noses and stuff?
-  Yeah.
(yelling)
Whoa!
(laughing)
Did you get some candy?
- You got a piece Jackson
that's great.
- Wow!
- I was scared for my life.
- I was holding the kids
like both of them, like
- It was like slow motion,
I was just like yeah.
- It's been a long time,
no you can't go to Zupas.
- You buy J Dawgs, I'll by Zupas.
- We haven't had J
Dawgs in like two years,
a yeah, I don't know, but
every time we come down here,
you have to stop at J Dawgs,
because it's the best hot dog
this side of the Mississippi.
What?
- That family is laughing at us.
-  They were?
- I feel like I should've
told them to look us up,
and then I thought, no,
just let 'em laugh at us.
-  Wait, so you're telling me you
all chose Zupas over J Dawgs?
-  You guys should all be ashamed
of yourself and your family.
-  She's okay.
- Jeepers.
Five hours in the car
can give you one crick in the neck.
- I know seriously, but I am so glad
that Julie is not 13 or 15 hours away,
she's only two.
- Yeah, two and a half.
- So it was really fun.
- I know, that little
extra stretch is hard,
but I'm really glad that
we decided to go hang out
and spend the evening
and the cousins playing.
Sometimes when all the
family gets together,
it's always fun, but the
cousins like disperse
and like they're gone.
And it was kinda fun having
them more like one on one,
it was fun.
- Yeah, it was fun to
hang out and we love going
to Cornbelly's, we go I
think like every year.
- Yeah.
- Or we try to.
- Because it's a fun place in Utah
for Halloween and Thanksgiving
and the Tulip Festival and all of that.
- We could've stayed four more hours.
-  We didn't even
scratch the surface.
- Yeah, we just got like one section done.
- But here's the thing,
I think the past three
or four night total,
I think I've gotten seven hours of sleep.
Like for the past three nights total,
so two plus three plus
-  Five.
- Three and something like that, four,
three two, I don't know.
I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to bed.
Ellie, sign off for us.
(laughs)
- Well first thanks Jared so much,
like this isn't a traditional job,
but Jared does put in more hours
than he ever has with
any other job he's had
and I'm grateful for him.
-  Well thank you.
- And I'm grateful for you guys
and I'm grateful for Miss Penny,
my pretty Penny, what the heck
are you doing on my pillow?
Extra special thank you to Christina
for watching the video today.
Bye guys.
(snoring)
- Bye.
