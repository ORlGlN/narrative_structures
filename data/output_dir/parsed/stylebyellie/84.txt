-  I do not like
to overline my lips.
The day after Christmas
they take their tree down.
That's kinda sad.
(laughing)
Is that better?
Excuse me, mam, I was here.
-  Hello.
-  Say yeah!
-  Yeah!
-  So, you're probably wondering,
what do you Ellie and Jared
and Bonnie and Joel do
when they're hanging out?
How you doing?
(laughing drowns out speech)
-  Are we all situated?
Okay, close your eyes.
What! Jared's out and about
and the kids and I got
the hot tub this morning
and it was so fun to play and swim around.
And, I told them, I said,
"if we all take naps
when we wake up we're gonna
see our cousins today."
And, the kids woke up, like,
five o'clock this morning
to play with toys and
so they are so tired.
Usually, this is not like
them to just lie down,
but Calvin was like, "Okay, I'm tired."
And, they love those! People
have asked where we got 'em.
I don't know. I wish so bad
that I knew where we got 'em.
They were given to us when
Jared was doing a presentation
and someone gave them to us. We love them!
But, the kids are situated.
I'm gonna take a snooze
and lay down and then
we'll see our cousins
and we'll play later.
-  Hello. How are you?
Good morning, good morning.
Editing Jared, here. I've
been editing like crazy
and I have some good news for you.
If you head on over to Ellie's channel
you will see a brand new
video, and that brand new video
is all about what we got for Christmas.
Yes. Me, Ellie, Jackson,
Calvin and even Penny;
what we got for Christmas.
Even some things that we
didn't show in the vlog.
I'll have a link to it down
in the description down below
for you guys to check out.
Head on over to here channel.
I think its a fun video,
I think you will love it.
If you do head on over there,
let us know you enjoyed it
by giving it big thumbs up and thank you
so much for watching it.
-  The kids taking
naps was a success.
When I get ready into my makeup,
a lot of times I'll do
a few drops of this.
I've talked about this before,
its the Pure Hydrafluid.
The brand is Pure and I get it from Ulta.
I mix a little bit with my foundation
because sometimes I feel
like when I do my foundation
and even add blush and stuff,
I just look really pale,
and that adds a little bit of color to it.
But. Today I feel like I
added a little too much.
I don't know if you guys can tell
but my face is quite a
bit darker than my neck.
I don't know if you can tell.
So, I have a ton of makeup
on and I do feel kinda gross
but Jared got me these two
lipsticks for Christmas
and I didn't really
look at them very close.
But, this one, actually,
is like a deep pink
and that's a true red.
So, hopefully you can tell
the top one right here,
that's true red; and right here,
is like a fuchsia deep pink.
So, I think I'm going to
do the deep pink today.
I always put chap stick on
and wipe the foundation off
because I get foundation on my lips
but when you wear a matte lipstick
you really wanna make sure
it's nice and moisturized.
We need a new camera, so bad!
That's what we should've got
for Christmas is a camera
because the focus has
been so unbelievably bad.
Uh-huh, oh baby!
(mellow music)
I do not like to overline my lips
but it was pretty close this time.
Okay, I'll fix that part in a minute.
Someone just rang the door.
What's up, Jacks?
-  There's someone at the door.
-  Okay, just answer it.
-  Okay.
-  I'll come. Okay, gotta go.
I love the color, it looks so good.
I did mess up right
there. I gotta fix that
but I'm gonna finish getting ready
because we are gonna go out tonight.
Ta-da! There I am, all ready.
Why are you laughing?
Are you laughing at me?
(laughing)
Today, I thought we can play one more day
or we can clean up the house.
I've seen a lot of people on Instagram
the day after Christmas
they take their tree down.
That's kinda sad. I wasn't
gonna take the tree down
but I was wondering if I should
put their toys in their room
or organize the toys and I
thought lets play one more day
and tomorrow when we wake up
we will clean and organize
and put stuff away.
Hey, how come you look
so cool in that outfit?
-  He wants to kiss you so bad!
(laughing)
-  Is that better?
(laughing)
Mr Kissing McGee, you look so cute.
-  Duh!
Hey!
-  Excuse me, mam, I was here.
-  No, I think...
-  Mam, you brought you're baby,
you're gonna have to pay
for that? That ticket?
-  Thanks for asking, I'm good.
-  He's helping
him zip up his coat.
(crowd noise)
-  Hiya! You little...
(laughing)
-  Boo!
(film plays in background)
-  Jackson insisted on
sitting next to Aunt Bonnie.
-  Between Bonnie and Boston.
-  We are dancing
our way out, woohoo!
Was that fun? Did you love it?
-  It was so good.
-  That was so funny.
-  Scoot back.
-  We watched this movie!
-  We did, did you like it?
- (Jackson] Yeah.
-  Hey, I even offered
to give Bonnie a liquorice
and she said no. So, if you
watch her video you'll no why.
-  Calvin, come here.
-  Right here, Cal.
-  Let's take your picture.
Can you look at Aunt Bonnie?
-  Did you love the movie?
-  Say yeah!
-  Yeah!
-  1, 2, 3, crazy face!
-  Say oompah loompah!
-  Cody or Boston. Look at me
and give me a crazy face.
-  Crazy face.
-  Right here.
(Ellie makes ringing sound with tongue)
-  Well, I hope you guys
liked Christmas break, ah...
-  I don't think
we've ever been successful at
taking our kids' pictures.
(laughing)
-  Bonnie.
-  What?
-  Can we come to your house?
-  It's getting
close to bed time, honey.
-  I loved
when the bowl was the tree
because it was electric so
I could turn on the lights.
-  That was the
best. That was so funny
we laughed hard.
-  Sorry guys,
but we ditched the kids.
Hi, how's it going?
-  Hey!
-  We, after our movie,
were like we don't really
wanna stop hanging out
so let's get a babysitter
and that's what were doing right now.
-  Bonnie is always
so good and gets sitters
when the kids go to bed
and come to our house
so its our turn to come over here.
-  I know and I love
when we go over our head and
this is the best part of it.
-  And we brought food.
Everything we do involves
hanging out and eating food,
so and another tradition
that Joel is beginning to do
is looking at razors. So, I
like that quite a bit, so.
-  It's a nice pastime.
-  Yeah, great. So...
-  Just, starts an
addiction so that's good.
-  Why don't we get one?
-  Not soon enough.
-  Okay.
-  So, you're probably wondering
what do Jared and Ellie
and Bonnie and Joel do
when they're hanging out.
This is like behind the
scenes. What we actually do
real time.
-  What we do
with you see us, anyway.
-  Yeah. Is we're literally
just sitting on the couch
we have some Swedish Fish.
-  Some! A five
pound bag and we plan
on eating all of it.
-  How much is left in there?
Yeah, there's like, um...
(Jared makes robotic noise)
There it is! And we're
watching Dude Perfect.
And, we have been for
probably the last hour.
So...
-  It's pretty sweet.
-  Our life is
pretty amazing, I know.
I know you guys are jealous, I know.
-  You know, I've never watched him
but Bonnie and Joel do and
I think it's really fun.
-  Dude Perfect's freakin' awesome.
-  I'm obsessed.
-  They've been one of
the channels that I've watched
from the beginning, yeah.
-  Devon Supertramp.
-  Devon supertramp
right there, too, yeah. What's that?
-  I taught him everything I know.
-  Did you, really?
-  I did it so good.
-  Yeah.
I don't know how they got there.
Well, now I do. You taught them.
So, that's what we're
doing on Wednesday night.
Is today Wednesday? It is Wednesday.
10pm. We're watching Dude
Perfect and eating Swedish Fish.
How you doing?
(laughing drowns out speech)
I'm editing right now
and I am Pulling In Jared
so I think that means we
have to call it a night.
