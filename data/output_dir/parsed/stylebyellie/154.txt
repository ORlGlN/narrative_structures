- Last night when we were
putting all the kids to bed,
we said, if you go to bed really good,
when you wake up, we'll get in the hot tub
and then at 6:55, the sun wasn't up yet,
everybody had their swimming suits on.
Who pushed pause?
-  It's loading.
- Oh it's loading.
Perfect, let me finish
my conversation then.
And so everyone got in the hot tub
and now that we are all
dressed and ready for the day
- We're watching the Emoji movie.
- We are, the first time we've seen it.
If you guys have seen it,
tell me what you think.
So far it's kind of cute.
But my internet's lame,
so we'll just sit here a second and wait.
- Give me it.
-  Is that your toy?
Alright come up here,
it's working in my room.
(enchanting music)
Internet connection's
better up here, so pile on.
- Last night was wonderful,
mainly for one reason, my
air mattress didn't pop
last night, so I actually
slept pretty well,
how about you Lando?
- I guess Joel kept the
place warm all night.
-  How'd you sleep man?
- I slept great,
except for when it got cold.
And I had to get up and
put wood on the fire.
-  Did you sleep good Lando?
- I did.
I gotta get this flashlight off here.
- Oh here, get on my shoulders.
(playful music)
- I'm not gonna hurt ya?
- No.
-  I will try
to bear as much weight
- Why are your knees so sharp?
You have abnormally sharp knees Landon.
Okay now walk us over.
You got it?
- Yeah.
- You have it already?
- Yeah.
-  You do?
Oh you got it okay.
Okay.
-  Slowly.
- Are you hanging?
(laughing)
I've got ya, I've got ya.
Okay okay.
Landon, we're safe.
I got you, I got you.
- It's too late.
-  I guess we
could've used the ladder.
- Yeah we could've used the ladder.
- Anyway, breakfast is almost ready.
We've got eggs and hash
browns and sausage.
Oh smiley.
Look it's getting a smiley.
- Hey a smiley.
-  Smiley, that's so cool.
-  He's happy to see us.
-  Good morning.
-  Good mornin'.
-  Joel, how did you do that?
He's got a nose now too, that's amazing.
- Eyebrows eyebrows eyebrows eyebrows.
- Aww.
- Aww, boo.
-  Hey it's Picasso.
- Some people can make
apples look so pretty.
These aren't pretty,
but they're gonna be good.
-  I told Bonnie last
night that she was my Chloe.
- Because of all the stories I have?
-  I don't know,
doesn't that look good?
- Chloe is hot right now.
-  Well she always has been.
She's always been cute
and like my favorite.
-  I'm gonna go
with the stick, oh dear.
-  Oh wow, and
you've got kids bumping
- I know look at all
these hands that are like,
give me a chocolate.
-  Give me a truck.
-  I'm not given you truck.
- My truck,
it's my truck.
-  You want to take another bite?
-  Emma, do you want one?
-  Isn't that nice
of Aunt Julie to make?
Jules, thanks.
- You helped.
-  I did the strawberries.
- Well see hers stayed on the bottom.
-  Awesome.
(whimsical music)
(spitting)
(bright music)
- Don't pull that, let me do it.
(Ellie laughs)
Are you laughing at me?
-  No.
We didn't do anything, okay?
- You're scary.
- Come on.
- Stop it.
- Cross your fingers.
-  They're all slippery.
(groaning)
This house is secure.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
And we're never getting in again.
- We are here eating some
lunch with the cousins.
We actually have someone
we're meeting here
to talk to a little bit later,
because my mom's is a
perfect middle point,
to where everyone lives,
so we're hanging out
here for a little bit,
waiting for the boys to
get back from their trip.
And their battery is dead
to get in their garage.
We changed the battery, it won't work,
so now we're trying to get inside.
- I don't know, I'm at a loss.
-  This one is the last option
that I think would be open.
Yes yes yes!
(screaming)
- Somebody has to go up on the ladder.
-  Yeah who's
gonna jump through it.
-  How are we gonna get in?
(bright music)
- Mom can I jump that high?
-  I don't know, I feel
like you're just too little.
- I'm not too little.
-  You think you could do it?
- Yeah.
- I'm worried.
- I want to jump that high.
-  Let's watch Cody.
-  I want to jump that high.
I want to jump that high.
I want to jump that high.
-  You hold on so tight.
- Okay.
-  No flips.
Go try it.
Oh my hell, let Cody go first.
I don't know what Jared's
gonna think of this.
Woo hoo, no flips Jacks.
- Jackson Jackson!
-  Woo!
- Yeah!
-  What did you think, come here.
Come here.
What did you think about that?
- I want to do it again.
-  Were you really high?
Were you afraid?
- I want to do it again.
- Okay, so slow, wait for your cousins.
So growing up at my grandma's house,
she used to have a river in her backyard
and we were so young,
I remember being four years old
in a life jacket in the river
and it would go left or right
and you had to do the left one,
because if you got right,
it wasn't in her property anymore,
so we'd swim as hard as hard as we could
to go to the left to go in a circle
around my grandma's house.
And it was kinda scary
and that's kinda how
I feel about this.
It's like it's a little nerveracking
I mean it's not crazy high,
but just getting there,
you know it's nerve wracking.
Woo!
Jackson.
-  Wow!
-  Okay you go.
One two three go.
(Ellie laughs)
- Wait, my hat's falling off.
- Come here mister.
What did you think of that?
- Good.
-  Were you scared?
- No.
- I almost didn't really
want you to do it.
- I wanted to.
-  But you're pretty brave.
- Yeah.
-  I could see it
in your soul you wanted to.
- When we come back, I'm
gonna jump from there then.
-  When we move the tramp,
when we move it back sometime, huh.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go jump.
- Okay.
I don't think I ever laugh as much
as when I'm with Bonnie.
- I don't know why.
- And I think it's just
there's something there.
Like I was thinking in
the car on the way here,
Cody rode with us, so
Jackson and Cody were talking
and laughing the whole time
and I was trying to think
of the age difference between them.
- Are they the same as us?
- They are, Cody's six
and Jackson's three,
so not quite as far as me and you,
but I was like okay.
You know what really makes me laugh
is that smile, say cheese.
- Cheese.
(laughs)
You got Oreo all over your teeth
and you smell like poop.
Did you poop?
- No.
- We need to go potty, huh?
Jackson, you have no fear my son.
Is it because you're Spiderman?
Ah hey, don't kick me or I'll kick you.
(laughing)
Turds.
You seriously have no fear.
He just wants to run and play.
I'm glad that you like that.
Do you think Daddy's
gonna be proud of you?
- Yeah.
-  I think that was fun.
- That was funny that I kicked you.
-  It wasn't funny, it hurt.
Okay it was funny a little bit.
You're crazy, where did you go?
Did you know, that when I was your age,
that Mommy used to do this?
- Yeah.
-  Yep, when I
was your age, crazy huh.
I think I keep getting Bonnie's bad side.
(laughing)
(lively guitar music)
Hey, you've been really mean today.
(laughing)
There's mean Aunt Bonnie,
pushing all the kids down.
Oh my gosh.
(laughing)
Get set go!
- I need to jump.
-  Okay, your turn Cal.
(Ellie laughs)
- Oh my buddy my pal,
I missed you so much,
how was your nap in the car?
- Good.
- Good, did you sleep good?
I missed you so so so much.
Did you jump from the
treehouse to the trampoline?
Was it scary?
Was it fun?
Oh my gosh, like that's so crazy.
- I was a little hesitant.
Well at first I was
like, I don't think so,
you should've seen his face,
he was like I can do it.
- Can you do it?
Yeah you did it.
What a brave kid, 'cause
you're Spiderman, huh.
Spiderman's a little tired still.
Give me a kiss, I missed you.
Mwaa, and as for you Mr.
Man, hey, I missed you too.
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Oh you missed the chocolate
covered strawberry.
I understand, those are delicious.
- Mama.
- What?
- When is Dad home?
- Dad's home.
He's walking Penny.
- Oh.
- Okay, two more bites
and we'll go to bed.
Oh don't hit, don't hit.
Okay, eat your food up.
Eat your food up.
Aw you hurt your leg?
(laughing)
Oop, ahh, beep,
bop, boop, bla bla bla.
Waa, you signed,
ready, ready?
What's that?
Beep, beep,
biddle dee bop bop boop boop.
Biddle dee pop pop boop.
Wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk.
(laughing)
Boop, wonk wonk wonk.
Show me how you're soft.
Show me how you're soft.
Soft.
Did you have a good day?
You did?
- I need the hat.
Hit my head.
- You hit your head.
- Yeah.
- Who did?
- Owie.
- Yeah, that was from the other day.
Okay, just a few more
bites, and then you're done
- Ahh.
-  Yeah, get 'em good.
Scrub 'em real deep,
but uh sorry.
- I'm washing my face,
get out of here.
- I'm sorry.
-  Oh Ellie, don't
It's been a hard day.
- The kids were so bad, I cried about it.
-  Let me wipe those tears away.
You should get some waterproof mascara,
that'll solve everything.
- Yeah but then it'll rip my eyelashes off
if I ever try to get it off.
- Oh you don't want ripped
eyelashes, that's the worst.
You want eyelashes like me.
My dad is playing at a pumpkin walk.
So he's playing music,
I'm gonna go help him set up his audio
and listen to him, 'cause
there's a ton of people
out there at this pumpkin walk
where they have this
beautiful pumpkin display,
so I'm gonna go help him out.
You keep washing your face
and I'll see you in an hour or two.
- Just getting all the eye boogies out.
- Gotta get those eye boogies.
So I've been outside
for about, I don't know,
five minutes and everything
and I'm already freezing.
I'm not sure how you're music Dad,
with your fingers on the guitar.
- It is gonna be cold, it's gonna be cold.
- So dad has me helping
him set up his master plan.
If you can't tell, that's
all of his equipment,
and we have to figure out the way
to get it on the stage.
I don't want to do a
jigsaw puzzle tonight,
this is crazy.
♫ She yelled said I'm doing fine
♫ Don't you let me catch you
staying alone any old day
♫ Papa's got a ticket on the mule express
Well I'm home and my hands
aren't freezing anymore.
Thank you so much for watching Faith,

and we will see you next time.
Thanks again for watching.
I appreciate you, bye
