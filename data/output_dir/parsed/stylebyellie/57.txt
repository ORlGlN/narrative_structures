and I was like, do you need to go potty?
And he had to go potty and he went.
I'm so proud of him.
Mister.
You've been so good to him as well, huh?
Every time he goes,

-  Come on, let's go.
-  He's like, I already did.
- Too late Mom.
Look young man, that is not
the way that you potty train.
(laughing)
Upside down on the rocking chair
is not how you potty train.
You do it on the toilet, silly.
You do it on the toilet, silly.
Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.
- Now we're going to the bathroom,
not to your bedroom.
Oh are you gonna bonk your head?
Whoa, can you touch it?
Yeah!
(Calvin laughs)
Wee oooh!
(lively guitar music)
Jackson, would you come
in here please right now
and tell Mommy what
happened at school today?
Come tell Mom, hurry come here.
Come here.
You have a special badge on
and I want you to show Mom.
So let's go, let's go, let's go.
- What did you get at school?
-  What does that say?
-  Let me see.
♪ Bum badda bum ♪
- You were spotlighted today.
- Uh-huh.
- What did they do?
- They talked about Calvin and Pen.
- They talked about Calvin and Pen?
- Uh-huh.
- And they talked about
how he's your brother?
- Uh-huh.
- And did they talk about
your favorite color?
And your favorite food?
- Mmm yep.
- And what you like to do?
- Yep.
- What did they say that you like to do?
- I don't--
-  You don't know
what you like to do?
(Jared laughing)
- Awesome, that's fun.
- Yeah.
- When I was a kid, getting spotlighted
was my favorite thing.
-  Totally.
- Because it's just, every
week they would do it,
but it's just okay, this is my turn to be
in front of the class,
I want to tell you what I like to do
and that sort of thing,
so getting spotlighted is fun.
And Jackson was spotlighted
today in pre-school.
- Yay.
-  That's cool, huh?
Welcome back from school buddy.
Did you have fun today?
- Yep.
-  Good.
Are you ready to roll BK Broiler?
- Yep.
- Let's get your shoes and socks on.
We're gonna go on a nice after school
walk with Penny and we're
taking the drone with us.
DJI just announced a new Mavic Air
and I am salivating
- dying.
- right now.
I want to get my hands on that so bad.
So we're gonna take the Mavic Pro
and we're gonna fly it around.
And do you want to fly
it a little bit buddy?
Would you like that?
- I want to fly it.
- Okay, we're gonna make sure to show you
Jackson's specific footage
that he does, on a drone
on our walk with Penny in the park.
Were you laughing at me doing that?
- I was making fun of you.
- You were making fun of me?
Why are you making fun of me,
laughing at me, doing that?
- I am gonna stay here.
I am ready for a bunch of seven year olds,
eight year olds--
-  Nine, eight and
nine year olds, right?
- To come over and we're cooking
for activity days tonight.
- A lot of these girls
that are coming over
were in my class that I
used to teach in church.
Calvin is taking a nap.
He's had a rough day, let's just say that.
- Yeah, potty training's
been emotional for him.
-  Yes it has.
It's been rough.
Alright Penny is comping at the bit,
to go on an adventure.
I say we let her go.
You ready for this?
What do we say when we want to let her go?
- Take a break.
-  That's right.
Come here Penny.
Take a break!
(Jared laughs)
-  She loves running.
-  Yes she does.
(bright music)
Okay, how was that, was that fun?
- Uh-huh.
-  Are you ready to go?
- Yeah.
-  It's pretty chilly outside, huh?
- Uh-huh.
- Come on Penny let's go.
That's my girl.
Okay let's get going.
Playing in the snow is so much fun,
but I am ready for some warm weather.
I know it's only January.
We still have about three
months left of this,
maybe two and a half, I don't know.
You never know with the weather in Utah.
You know, after awhile in the wintertime,
you just get the winter blues.
And I'm ready for some sun,
ready for some warm weather.
Are you ready for some warm weather
or do you like the cold weather?
- The warm weather.
- The warm weather?
Yeah that's pretty nice, huh?
If you could travel to one warm place,
where would it be,
whether it be for a week,
for a lifetime,
one warm place, where
would you like to go?
Let me know in the comments down below.
- I've been a little missing in action
because of potty training right now.
Calvin woke up from a nap and he's just,
I think it's just draining for toddlers.
I can only imagine how
draining it is for them,
if it's tiring for us, you know?
(Calvin yelling)
He's in there, he's really sad right now.
But I wanted to show you guys
what we made tonight with
the girls for activity days.
Chicken noodle soup.
So we did rotisserie chicken,
but my partner, my friend,
she did the broth,
where she had the bones and
water and got her own broth.
So we did broth,
and then the girls cut up all the stuff,
put it in there and we did toast,
some of it got burnt,
but the girls loved it,
they loved cooking,
they loved eating it all up.
And it was a really fun night.
I'm looking in the viewfinder
and I'm like, is that me?
I totally look pregnant today.
And I like that, it's just weird,
you don't look at yourself all that much,
so when I opened the
viewfinder, I was like,
oh I look very pregnant today.
I'm gonna be 18 weeks this week guys.
There's my baby bump.
Can't even believe it,
so I'm just hurrying
cleaning up the kitchen,
so I can get on the night
with finishing up working with Calvin
and putting the boys to bed.
- Parents I hope you can relate to this,
because I don't know,
do you ever feel like when you have kids
who are on edge,
you are literally trying to defuse a bomb,
like you are going
through every last thing
so delicately and if you
do something wrong, boom!
You're done, you're toast,
the bomb went off.
You know what I mean?
- Totes.
- Remember it took us a long time
when Jackson would get mad,
he would hit his head--
-  Oh yeah.
- on the floor when he was a toddler.
Just staring to talk, just
was getting really upset
-  Mmm-hmm.
- and that was hard for us.
-  Really hard.
- And with him, we were trying
to teach him, you can't do that.
And I just remember for a long time
that was diffusing.
- Yeah.
- That situation.
- And Calvin right now,
that's kinda where we are.
He just woke up from a nap.
And that's when it's the worst.
That's when it's atom bomb,
when they just wake up from
naps and they're cranky.
- Well he was so tired today.
I went in the room
and just sat in the rocking chair
and I'm like, I'm gonna rock
you or you can just cry.
And then soon he got in
my lap and I rocked him
and he fell asleep.
-  Oh that's cute.
- He was just so done for the day.
- Well and the thing is,
when you're doing all of this stuff,
it's mentally and physically
tiring for Calvin,
just as much us, but for Calvin too,
so we're trying to get
him on the schedule,
we're trying to do all of
this potty training stuff,
he's trying to figure out himself.
And it's funny, because whenever
we're doing dog training,
Penny does the same thing.
She'll get a little frustrated,
she'll be like rarrarrra,
(Ellie laughs)
until she understands what
I'm trying to teach her
and once she does, she's
like oh I get it finally.
So we go through these mental
- And then she's exhausted.
- and physical exhaustion,
and then after, every time
after a training session,
Penny zonks out, she is tired.
So she always takes a nap
after a training session.
So okay I feel like I've defused a bomb.
The kids are good, both of them.
They're having a great time together.
And I feel like I could join the army
and defuse bombs for a living now.
It's just one of those days.
You remember what I said
about disassembling a bomb,
I don't know, what, 30 seconds ago?
Well let me show you this.
It's 10 pm and I've got a visitor.
Hey.
(Jared laughs)
What are you doing?
What are you doing young man?
You're just not sleeping tonight?
Bye.
Oh my goodness, it's
going to be a rough night.
And I'm just gonna say it out there,
because it's going to be.
But we're gonna do the best
that we can with Calvin.
He's going to be up for late tonight.
I think we're at the point in time
where Calvin is just done with naps.
And it's the transition point,
where it's harder in
the middle of the day,
but he at least goes to bed at night.
He had a nap today
and it was a pretty late nap,
so that's why he's up so late
and just not sleeping, but
we can do this.
-  Lots of transitions
for this little guy.
- Yeah, he's going through
lots of transitions,
that's right Ellie.
Potty training, going from naps,
I think that's a big reason why they
call them the terrible twos.
But don't worry, as
soon as you turn three,
all of that goes away.
-  Actually three was hard.
- Three was harder for Jackson.
-  But life was grand.
- Yes, oh and this is,
yeah I don't wanna
think we're complaining.
We're explaining.
- Oh no, life is grand.
-  We're in the thick of it.
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
We're in the trenches right now
and we're going through it.
So, hey, thanks for watching guys.
I hope some of you are
doing through it with us.
-  O-M-G yes.
(Jared laughs)
-  Okay, Calvin,
can you say goodnight
to our friends?
No.
- That's a big fat no.
-  Okay, well we're
just gonna say goodnight.
Thank you guys for watching
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
