(playful music)
- Ellie, I got another
text message from Brian.
He is not stopping with this, he keeps
going on about it.
- What?
- He wants us to do the
Pumpkin Spice Challenge.
- I want to do it.
- Okay.
- After I tell my mom Happy Birthday.
- That's a little more
important, wouldn't you say?
- There we go. Got it.
- Posted it, it's official.
Happy birthday, Mom. (laughs)
Seriously, though, today
is Ellie's mom's birthday,
so happy birthday to her, go and
wish her a very happy birthday.
We're gonna go pick up
Jackson from school,
we're gonna go to the grocery store,
and we're gonna pick up some things,
some pumpkin spice things.
- Calvin, let's go!
- We gotta go, Calvin.
It's time to get some pumpkin spice.
- Before I dropped Jackson off at school,
he goes, because I was
getting my list ready,
he goes, "Don't go without me!
"I don't wanna go to school!"
I was like, "I will wait for you
"and then I will take
you grocery shopping."
- (laughs) He likes to push the cart.
I don't blame him one bit.
- This high!
-  You think we
can build it higher?
- Yeah.
-  I dunno.
It's already pretty tall.
Oh my goodness.
- I'm gonna knock it over.
- No, don't knock it over!
(dominoes clatter)
You know what that means?
We just have to build it again.
Just touch this one,
knock this one over, okay?
Just that one, okay, Jackson?
(dominoes clatter)
- Whoa.
We have a few places here
in town that is like this environment
where they have toys and stuff for kids
or adults to play with, and
it's kind of our, just like--
-  We have only games!
- And only games, just kind
of like a relaxing feel.
We are waiting to have
Jared's parents come
and then we're gonna eat with them.
- Yeah, this one, then this one,
then this one, then this one!
-  Yep, yep, yep.
- All of these ones.
Just three.
(Ellie laughs)
Or four.
-  I think you're cute.
Guess what?
I didn't go grocery shopping yet.
I waited so you could come with me.
(playful music)
- Grandma and Grandpa
have this amazing garden
and they grew pumpkins this year.
Are you gonna pick one?
- I'm gonna pick this one.
-  Wow, that looks like
a perfect pumpkin for Jackson.
What about you, Calvin?
(Calvin babbles, excited)
A green one?
Do you wanna know something?
Those green ones are actually watermelons.
- No, they're not!
(Jared laughs)
What about this pumpkin right here?
Do you like that pumpkin?
-  That's a nice pumpkin.
These all came from your garden.
- Yeah!
- These look so good, Mom.
Like look at this one, that's so perfect.
- I think we should paint them tonight.
-  That would be fun.
Would you like to paint a pumpkin?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- I wanna paint these ones.
-  All right.
-  Excuse me, mister, what
are you using the marshmallows for?
- They're my, the pillow.
- The pillow?
Okay, well, I guess we won't have
a yummy snack for dinner.
- I want a snack for dinner!
- Okay, after dinner, I mean.
Jackson's helping me make a little snack
because tonight we are
doing pumpkin painting
and he really wanted to make a treat
so we're gonna make Rice Krispie treats,
and I'm gonna tell you my secret.
It's not really a secret,
it's just how I like to
I don't like to follow directions,
I just do four tablespoons of butter,
and I melt mini marshmallows because it's
really hard to melt bigger marshmallows,
because like you overburn it or something,
so I do mini marshmallows, and I just add
enough Rice Krispies
until it's still gooey,
because sometimes if you follow
the directions, it's not gooey enough.
- Mama, open this thing.
- Okay.
You sit there and punch it
open while I finish dinner.
I'm making dinner first.
We'll have a snack and paint
pumpkins when Calvin wakes up
or we'll just kick 'em into the ground.
Pick the marshmallows
up, all the way high.
Whoo!
- Marshmallows!
-  Okay, good job.
Can you mix this for me?
- Sure.
- Okay.
It's kinda hard having
kids help because you want them to help
and they wanna help, but
you don't want anyone burnt.
Okay, mix that up really good.
Jackson wanted to actually
film and so I'm gonna
let him do that because that
was probably the safer option.
So in here, the marshmallows
aren't quite melted,
and I put the Rice Krispies in
before everything is melted.
- There is still more in.
-  Just a few.
- All of them.
-  Perfect.
Okay, start dumping that in.
- It's heavy.
- It is heavy.
Whoa, good job.
Good job.
Now do you wanna mix it?
Good job.
You are such a help.
It really is so helpful lately,
I've been asking Jackson a little more,
like, "Can you go grab this for me?
"Can you go grab me a wipe?"
and you've been so helpful, and he's
becoming to the age
where he's a lot better
at helping pick up, like it used to be
where we would pick up toys and he would
like not even help whatsoever, even if we
like tried to make him, you know,
it was like, he'd pick up one thing
and that was about it, but you've just
been really good at helping more, huh?
You've been picking up your toys
and making your bed more.
You've been a good helper, thanks.
(playful music)
How's it taste?
- Good.
- Do you guys remember on Sunday
how we were talking about
getting the kids to eat food
and it was just a matter of getting them
like to try a bite to realize that they
like it and everything,
well, scratch everything!
Everything I said is wrong!
(laughs)
- He did try it, and he didn't like it.
- (laughs) No, I'm just kidding,
but this is a meal, like this is
a challenge that we're going through.
I want you to take a b--
Calvin's gonna try and eat your food.
Calvin is chowing this down, but
Jackson, on the other hand, is not,
so this is spaghetti with
some meat and tomatoes,
it's really great, you want a bite?
There you go, good boy, you
eat it all up and everything.
That was, okay, Jackson, I want you
to take one more big boy bite, okay?
- I don't want to.
- Okay, look.
Look, see, this is the last one
that you've gotta take, okay?
All right, look at you, showing off.
He's like, "Oh look Mom, I did it."
Here you go.
Slurp it all up.
Slurp it all up, it's spaghetti.
That's the best part of eating spaghetti.
My point in all of this is
just to say, you know ...
- One day works, the next it doesn't,
with anything and everything.
- Exactly.
And you just have to keep at it.
- Today is my mom's
birthday, like we said,
Happy Birthday, I love
talking to her on the phone,
and as I'm sitting here eating dinner
I'm thinking about her
because all growing up,
she always planned the
meals, she always cooked,
and I just, that is something that
I really appreciated, and
not at the time, I didn't,
but now I do, and because I
think that's really hard work,
like whether you're on your own,
whether you have kids, or it's
just you and your husband,
it is hard to come up with meals,
to cook morning, lunch, and dinner,
and my mom always did that.
If we ever went out to eat,
we would order Chinese food,
and that was like our main thing.
That and pizza once in a while,
but we never just went out to eat,
and I'm really grateful
for my mom and her cooking.
Your mom did the same.
- Absolutely.
-  Cooked lots,
and we try.
(laughs)
- Except for us it was
pizza and Taco Bell.
- Oh, fun.
That was fun.
But I just appreciate my mom and all
the hard work that she
always did for her kids,
stuff that, little things like that
that are not little ...
(clatters)
We've got juice and noodles
flying all over the kitchen.
But those things are, they aren't little.
They seem basic, but they aren't,
and I really do appreciate it.
(playful music)
- So I'm filming a little B roll,
and I just noticed,
Calvin has two pumpkins,
and he's switching back and forth.
I just think that, for some reason
that's the funniest thing to me.
- Had to get lucky and get two.
-  So we're painting pumpkins, yay!
Is this fun, Jackson?
- I got paint on my hands.
-  Uh-oh, guess what?
It's super washable paint
and we'll be just fine if we take a bath.
That's not your pumpkin!
What are you painting on your pumpkin?
- Me!
-  You?
Me?
- Blue.
-  Blue.
- And dark blue.
-  Blue and dark blue.
Those are two of my favorite colors.
Oh wow, Jackson, that's
really cool-looking.
Little swirlage action there.
Calvin's got the green machine right here,
green and blue, and Ellie ...
You're going all out with the blueness.
Dah bah dee dah bah die, or
something like that, I dunno.
Hot glue guns, look at all
these accessories we've got.
- This is your mom's.
I'm so sorry, we borrowed it
and a year later we still have it.
- I've got some fun ideas for my pumpkin
so I'm gonna go ahead and get started.
- After it dries up, I wanna go
to Grandma's house and show.
-  Oh, and that would be so fun.
- I think she'll love it.
-  Yeah.
Especially because some of these
pumpkins are hers, that she gave us.
(playful music)
- He just spilled paint all over me.
-  I don't think
he meant to, I'm sorry.
That flew pretty far, I even think
he got some green on Penny's head.
Right there, there's some green.
(playful music)
-  Do you wanna see it?
Okay, open your eyes.
- You are the best.
-  (laughs) Is that cool?
- You're the best.
- It's a-me, Mario.
Of all the things I could forget,
knowing me, Jared Mecham,
I forgot his eyebrows.
No wonder he looks so funny.
Hold that thought.
(singing)
-  Did you learn that at preschool?
- Yeah.
-  I like that song.
Let's see your hands, how
much they got painted.
Oh, let's go take a bath.
- Here's the final product on the porch,
and everything, these
pumpkins look so great.
These are like honestly my
favorite kinds of pumpkins
because the kids just have
so much fun with them.
It's just them having fun, it's a blast.
And we haven't even got to the best part,
which is pumpkin carving!
Ooh, I'm so excited.
Gotta go back through that one video
and see which comment
has the most thumbs up
to see if I can actually do it.
I've been cleaning around the house
while Ellie's been getting the kids to bed
and I think she and Calvin
fell asleep in Jackson's room.
I'm gonna go peek on 'em and check,
but how hilarious, three (laughs)
three people in that tiny little bed.
- I know, one sec.
-  So, was that comfy?
(laughs) Good morning.
- I think it's hilarious that you
have a green dot on your head from Calvin.
Thank you guys so much, it's right there,
right there, the green dot.
- Right there.
- And thank you guys so much for
watching us painting pumpkins.
Thank you so much, Hannah, for
watching today's video, and I'm gonna go
get in the hot tub with some of our
neighborhood friends, so ...
- Have fun.
- The girls.
- The ladies' night.
- The ladies.
♫ Ladies' night
- Have fun.
I will, me and Boomer are gonna have soda
in my office and we're
gonna edit the video.
It's gonna be great.
-  Penny, you don't wanna come?
You don't wanna come?
Bye!
- Thanks for watching, bye!
