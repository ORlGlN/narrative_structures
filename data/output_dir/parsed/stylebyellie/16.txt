- We are going to do something so special.
- Family date night!
- Family date night!
- Yeah.
(howling)
(enchanting tones)
Whoa!
And our next adventure is
just around the corner.
- In a little over three months,
baby is coming.
And there is a handful of things
that we want to do with the kids
before baby comes.
One, I want to take Jackson
and Calvin on a date.
Both of the boys, all
about them, go on a date.
Then, we want to take the whole family,
the kids, Penny, Jared, our camper,
we want to go out, we want to
go on a little family trip.
Then, we want to take just Jackson
on his own date,
an all-day date just about Jackson.
Then an all-day date just about Calvin,
and maybe a date all about just Penny.
But that is what we want
to do before baby comes.
And in a little over three months,
that seems like still far away away,
but to get all that done,
I think we should start now,
so let's take our boys on a date.
- Let's go on a date with our boys.
Alright boys, we are going
to do something so special,
but before we do it,
we have to go to the store.
- Where are we going?
- Which store do you think
we're going to go to?
- The toy store!
- What toy store?
- The Disney one.
- What?
- That' right.
- Are we gonna go in?
- Should we go in the Disney store?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.
(bright music)
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Abracadabra.
(enchanting tones)
-  Whoa!
(enchanting tones)
That was amazing Jackson.
-  Jackson, look what I found?
It's Spiderman figurines.
- It's a bullet blaster.
- We are just hanging
out in our hotel room,
getting ready to take the kids
to their special date.
Jackson, let's see what you got.
The best Spiderman moves ever.
Jackson Clark doesn't even know
where we're going today.
He's going to be shocked.
- I'm not gonna be shocked.
-  I think you will be.
Calvin, let's see what
you got, Calvin's got--
(Ellie gasps)
What moves do you have?
Aww, you lost the battle.
- Look at him play dead.
He's doing so great by playing dead.
(Ellie laughs)
-  What moves do you have?
This one?
Whoa.
- Whoa.
The major cannonball extreme.
Whoa,
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah.
-  Calvin.
- This was his move.
-  That was his move.
-  Can you do it?
-  Spiderman has one more thing
he would like to show us.
Let's see what you got.
Whoa.
- Whoa!
-  It's almost like
there's Flash and Spiderman,
Flash and Spiderman.
Okay, let's see what you got Mr. Cal.
Jared, show us your moves.
- I'm Ironman.
-  What?
I bet no one knew that Ironman
was coming to our room.
- Yeah, Ironman, get it?
Because it's an ironing board?
- Yeah.
- Oh good.
(laughing)
Okay, so here's the game plan.
We have three hours until
the main event today.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay, so we gotta figure
out something to do.
I think one stop we
should do, is have lunch.
- Tots.
- Okay Mom, you're on lunch duty, okay?
- Okay.
- Calvin, you're on car safety duty.
That means you make sure
everyone gets in their seats
and has their seat belts on.
Jackson, what duty do you want?
- Going to the kid places.
- The kid places duty.
- The kid places duty.
- Okay and Daddy will be on driving duty.
- Family date night!
- Family date night!
- Yeah.
(howling)
(laughing)
- It would be fun to go to
a place we haven't been.
-  Yeah, it seems
like we've got a team effort
on the lunch duty.
Oh a place with a play area,
that could be fun.
- So are we wanting to go to
lunch now or probably before?
-  Maybe before we have our event.
- Salt Lake City in--
-  Yeah.
These kids are getting anxious to go.
- I see Spiderman's city.
(bright music)
There's the earth.
-  Is that the earth?
- Yeah.
-  Cool.
- So you're in charge
of kids' stuff today,
so where we should go?
- We're on the earth.
- We are.
- We are.
- I'm in charge the kids' stuff.
Let's go to the Clark Planetarium.
- Perfect.
- You got it.
-  Oh what good Spiderman muscles.
- Wow.
- Is that cool?
We're not even in it
yet and you're excited.
- This isn't even the date.
(bright atmospheric music)
- See that pen right there?
It's gonna knock it over.
-  Soon.
Ah!
That means that the world is rotating.
(bell dings)
Yeah.
- What?
-  It did it.
-  This is like what
we do to Jackson's rocks, huh?
- See how it's all bumpy,
now it's all smooth.
- Yeah.
- Look Jackson, this is a
real rock from outer space.
This is a meteorite and it landed on earth
in the year 1516.
- Ellie] That is crazy.
-  That is almost 2,000 pounds.
-  What if it landed at like,
I mean it has to land somewhere.
- Yeah,
it landed in China.
- Giant ball.
- A giant rock, yeah.
- And fall the giant ball.
- Yeah, it fell out of the sky.
- It fell out of the sky.
You're so cute, you're so cute.
I have a feeling for
Christmas Jackson might want
a new marble run.
Holy crapola.
- I could build it.
(Ellie laughs)
- Matt could build it.
(Ellie laughing)
They are so done.
Calvin's eating leftover popcorn, come on.
- I won again!
- You will not believe what
Calvin and I found, come on.
(Ellie gasps)
Look at all of these.
-  What is it?
- Shiny rocks.
- Shiny rocks.
- Shiny rocks.
- Oh I want this kind of one.
-  You like this?
Look at this one.
-  This is up Jackson
and Calvin's alley guys.
Those are beautiful.
- They're geodes, huh?
-  There's a
place I think in Dugway
or somewhere that you can
go get your own geodes
and brake 'em.
- Oh yeah?
-  We need to go do that.
- Yes we should.
(chill music)
Everything that we have done so far
has led up to this point right here.
Jackson, what are we doing?
- We're going to Disney on Ice!
-  Yeah, are you so excited?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, let's go.
- Even my sword.
-  Whoa, so cool.
We're gonna see Mickey and Minnie
and all of our favorite Disney guys.
Should we go find our seats?
- Yeah.
-  Alright.
Look what I've got, a crown for the king.
And for the jester, 'cause he's asleep.
Are you so excited dude?
I'm so excited for you, this
is gonna be such a blast.
Are you ready to see this bud?
Here we are.
-  The ice!
-  Do you see the ice?
- Yeah.
-  Is that so cool?
So fluffy, dude, look how
awesome these seats are.
Are you ready for this guys?
- Thank you Daddy.
- You're welcome.
Can I have a big bite like last time?
- All of it, bite it.
(lyrical Disney music)
Did you know that you used
to be scared of cotton candy?
(laughs)
You ate it and was like
scared of it and now
take a bite, you love it.
Are you ready?
Calvin are you ready?
- Yep.
- Yep.
(laughs)
(lively music)
- Mickey, Goofy said scary.
-  I don't know why he said scary.
(lively music)
- Woo!
He's lifting her so high.
(lively music)
(applause)
- Woo!
(cheering)
- That was crazy.
They're having intermission
and Jackson was extremely intrigued.
Who are you intrigued by?
- Snow White.
- Snow White.
Jackson really wants to see Snow White.
So when we get home, maybe tonight
or tomorrow morning,
we'll watch Snow White.
(playful guitar music)
(Jackson laughing)
The tiniest little bit?
What was your favorite part.
- The Elsa one.
-  The Elsa song?
Calvin, did you love it?
- Yeah.
-  What song was your favorite one?
Elsa?
- Well and just like that,
two hours later, we are finally home
and the kids are zonked in bed.
Disney on Ice was so awesome.
And anything Disney does,
whether it's Disneyland,
Disney World, the cruise,
Disney on ice, it's magical.
The experience was so awesome,
everything that they did was fantastic.
Highly recommend, ten out of ten,
would go again.
Now, just like Ellie said,
we want to do these kind of dates
with Jackson and Calvin
before the baby comes,
whether it's Jackson and Calvin,
or just Jackson
or just Calvin.
Or even just Ellie by herself,
me by myself, us two
together doing these things,
getting ready for the baby to come.
It's kind of fun to take time individually
with the kids and make them feel special
and we love doing that.
And the best part about it is
while we're home right now,
the adventure's not done yet.
We have the car ready,
we have the trailer ready
and our next adventure is
just around the corner.
So make sure you guys are subscribed,
because we are going to
do something very very fun
as a family to continue this date
that we're going on as a family.
But for now, we've got to get some rest
because we have a lot of stuff to do
before we go.
So with that, thank you
guys so much for watching.
I hope you had a wonderful day with us
as we spent the day with the family
doing some incredible stuff.
And we will see you guys next time,
when we do more awesome
stuff, thanks guys, bye.
