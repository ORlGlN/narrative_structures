(slow guitar music)
- I think that in the
four years of us vlogging
every single day, this has
been one of the hardest days
to pick up the camera and vlog.

♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, that was me, not Penny.
One, two, three, jump!
I honestly feel like our
boys can give Miranda Sings
a huge run for her money.
As far as being the number
one musician, magician,
actor, models, give me your
best model pose, Jackson.
(laughs)
Yeah!
The crowd goes wild.
Okay, now Calvin's turn.
Give me your best model pose.
The head bang.
See, our kids have something
going for 'em already.
- They're so cute.
- Yay!
I don't care what kind of model pose it is
as long as you're healthy.
- My singer song is like this.
♫ I'm still standing
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah
Things from the future
have always amazed me,
like on Back to the Future,
science fiction stuff,
like the rehydrator
from Back to the Future:
pizza done so fast.
(bell rings)
So cool.
We're just putting
Jackson's bed back together,
and I just wish there was a
way to put it back together
so much faster than just like folding
all the corners under and everything.
I may have come up with
a way, but I wish it was
a little more mainstream
that everyone could partake
of this opportunity.
You know what I'm trying to say?
I'll show you what I mean.
Okay, you ready for this one?
Watch closely.
One, two, three.
Ha!
See, easy as pie.
Anyone can do that, I think.
Guys, I gotta be up front
with you, straightforward.
I used camera tricks.
Sorry to disappoint you.
It's the truth.
See, you can see me putting
it together right now
as I'm telling you this.
Just camera tricks, Youtube
and camera tricks. I'm sorry.
Okay, fine, I'll pull out the camera.
Show me your cool trick.
Whoa!
Cool trick, dude.
You're so talented in multiple ways.
- I'm cool with this trick.
-  Yes, yes you are and
stylish moves like that, too.
- Yeah.
- I think in the four years of us vlogging
every single day, this has
been one of the hardest days
to pick up the camera and
vlog, and, as you can tell,
we haven't done a lot of that.
It's just been a pretty difficult day,
especially for Ellie.
Last night was the
hardest night for Ellie.
She was in so much pain
for hours and hours.
It was excruciating for her,
and I felt so terrible for her,
and, when I said yesterday
that she is resilient
and she's a trooper, I meant it.
Today has just been kind
of a hard day for her
and, with that, for us.
The whole process that
we wanted to go with this
is, you know, we wanted to
go and do this naturally,
and then we used the medication.
Then, we found out that
the medication didn't work,
and then the final result of
that is that we have to do
a DNC now.
Ellie has a DNC scheduled for tomorrow.
That is what she is
preparing for right now,
and, with anything related
to that kind of stuff,
surgeries, medical procedures,
one of the hardest parts
about that is that you can't
eat for a certain amount
of time, so I feel so
bad, but Ellie can't eat
half of the day today and half
of the morning 'til tomorrow.
I think she goes in like
at 11 o'clock tomorrow,
but her poor little tummy.
I just feel so bad that she's
not gonna be able to eat,
especially when I'm eating
all of these delicious treats
right in front of her.
I'm kidding.
I'm not gonna do that.
That's gonna be rude, Jared.
You're not gonna do that,
but the kids have just been
really sweet, just like you
saw in yesterday's video.
They've kinda been just all around Ellie
and being there for her and
just being sweet and tender.
Jackson has, I can't,
I think Calvin took it,
and he's asleep now, but
Jackson, at preschool today,
made a necklace for Ellie, and it was just
the sweetest thing, because he came home,
and he went right up to her and said,
"Mommy, I made this for
you," and that was just like
the sweetest thing.
I didn't tell him to do that.
I'm not sure if the teacher
told him to do that,
but I didn't tell him.
I was like, "Jackson,
that's a cool necklace,"
and he's like, "Yeah, I
made it at preschool,"
so it's just cool to see
these little tender moments
from our kids and how
they can kinda see that
there is something going on
and how they're responding to that.
They're extra cuddly,
and they're extra sweet,
and it's just nice to see that.
That is where we are at right now.
Tomorrow's gonna be a
pretty big day for Ellie,
preparing for that DNC, so
keep her in your thoughts
and prayers like you guys have.
We really have felt it and
appreciate it, so thank you,
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
