Gosh!
- This is amazing.
- It's just really sweet.
Thanks Julie.
- Dad, we don't go to sleep yet.
- Good morning Ellie.
- Good morning.
-  Today is the big day.
- You know it's special
when Mom's making breakfast.
(Jared laughs)
- Today is the day that we are
officially announcing Bollie.
You guys probably already know this,
but for us, it is going live today.
And this is a huge day for us.
This is the start of something brand new
from the very beginning.
- I know I told Jared, how scared were we
when we were like, let's
do daily, every day.
- Yeah I feel even more nervous for this
than I am when we quit our jobs
and went daily vlogging full time.
- Well we've invested a lot, so,
maybe that's why.
- Hey can you guys do me a favor
and cross your fingers for us?
You slept so good.
Thank you for sleeping so good.
- So where's my cousins.
- What?
- Where's my cousins?
- Are they coming over today?
-  I think they are.
- Oh my goodness.
I think they'll be here
in maybe 26 minutes.
That's like one Peppa Pig show.
-  Look at that yawn.
- We used to do that as kids.
When we asked my parents
how long something would be,
she'd be like that's one He Man show.
(laughing)
-  You want to help me?
-  Oh what a nice boy.
-  Okay, I'll let you
help me make breakfast, okay?
Making hash browns,
veggies, some sausage, okay?
Mr. Cal, you look like you have
a question mark on your face.
(Ellie laughs)
- You doing okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
(bright music)
- The chocolate cake is done.
- Can I touch?
-  A little, sure
not with your tongue.
No I said not with your tongue.
- Why?
-  Because we're
not just gonna eat it
and I don't want other
people to think it's gross.
That's not hot.
- Is it gross?
-  No.
Okay, oh my gosh.
You guys finish that.
I'm gonna finish decorating the cake.
This is amazing.
Kids helping parents make cakes
is fun, but sometimes very overwhelming.
He just shot his toy in
the cake, oh my gosh.
Okay let me wash it,
so that you can play with it.
Let's wipe your hands.
(bright music)
(laughs)
I am so glad you're here.
I thought, Cody's not here, is he?
-  No, nuh-uh.
- Just Boston?
I thought you were Cody.
-  Ho ho!
-  Ooh, wipe your own hand.
(laughing)
- Did you catch some snot rockets?
-  I was grabbing
'em for the Nintendo's sake,
not for anything else, oh my gosh.
- Oh my goodness, what are you doing?
You made breakfast?
- Yeah, you don't have to
eat it if you don't want.
I don't know how good it's gonna be.
- Oh my gosh, that's so cute of you.
What?
Is it someone's birthday?
♪ Happy birthday to Bollie ♪
- I have a birthday cake!
- Birthday Bollie!
(laughing)
I was like who's birthday did I forget?
- I thought you came over for my party?
(laughing)
-  Did you forget my birthday?
- You're so cute.
- The cake and the frosting
is all homemade, cocoa,
it's supposed to be really good.
-  Yep.
- Awww, so cute.
- How fun.
- But I didn't have a topper,
so I filled it with chocolate.
- That's alright.
- How many people does it take
to have a website go live?
I think all of us feel
like we're gonna throw up.
Jared's on the YouTube end,
and Joel's over there helping.
Bonnie's trying to figure out our--
- Instagram,
- Instagram, Twitter and the website.
- I feel like I'm a chicken
with my head cut off
running around, like seriously at a loss.
- Well we have check list after check list
after check list and then
we're like oh yeah and this,
oh yeah and this, it's like never-ending.
- So we're making the
website live at 8:57 AM,
then Instagram will be
public, Twitter and Facebook
at nine AM.
What other things do we need to change?
The channel art?
-  Channel picture.
- The channel picture.
That needs to be at 8:58 as well,
because that's gonna be, okay channel--
- Like I don't feel sick,
my stomach just hurts like I just--
- I just want room to breathe.
- Yeah yeah.
No that's the exact thing.
It's like oh my gosh, it's hot.
- It's like scoot over baby.
- Maybe we should open a window
to give us some circulation in here.
- We probably should.
(laughing)
-  We're all gonna
be passed out on the floor.
- Penny's over there
fartin' in the corner.
- It's hard to imagine
what it's like in this room
without having those
feelings in your stomach,
you know what I mean?
-  Yes.
- Right now my heart is just pounding.
You guys just got something sweet,
who is it from?
- Mom.
- Good luck today girls,
but I don't think you'll
need it, love Mom.
And it means a lot and
did you get the text?
- Beau.
Yeah Beau said--
- Yeah Beau nd Emily.
- big day today, we're excited for you.
It's just really sweet that
the family's been so sweet
and supportive, whoa we're gonna cry.
(laughing)
- There's no crying in our business.
- There's no crying in Bollie.
- There's no boobin' in
Bollie, get it, cause of the--
- I like it.
- You got the biggest boobs in the world
that just made it, so.
- Yeah we pretty much cry at everything.
- Anything.
(laughing)
- My dad would say, he's like my mom
would cry at everything,
she cried at the grand
opening of the supermarket
on their street.
- Awww.
- Isn't she just special, she's fun.
- Maybe it was a really good supermarket.
- It was her supermarket.
- It's a good supermarket.
- PS, I'm ordering two robes,
one for me, one for Aunt Patsy
and Aunt Julie's birthday.
-  Awww.
- It's already past, she'll have to wait.
That's cute.
- We're literally just
sitting here waiting.
I feel like everything is ready and--
- I feel like I need to slap everyone.
Wake up!
(laughing)
- I should've expected that.
(mock crying)
- We're literally watching the clock.
- I know.
- We're watching the
clock, waiting for our cue,
we all have our jobs to do.
- That was your Dad.
He's all, no video today?
- Oh jeez.
(laughing)
- So annoying Dad.
- Go Grandpa.
- No.
- Don't you watch me on Twitter?
- We have six things that we have to do,
but we have to start it at 8:58,
because of emails and live and waaa.
- This is exciting.
- Ahhh!
- I will just tell you this,
if the two of you are going to have
some type of Mom talk show,
I will be there for it.
- Awww.
- The best part of your
vlog is when you just
talk to the camera and share your heart.
- Who said that?
- These are just Twitter comments.
-  Yeah, that's 3433.
- Aww Liz, you're great.
Okay.
- I'm gonna ball my eyes out.
- We're gonna get one sale
and I'm gonna ball my eyes out.
- Thanks Mom!
(laughing)
- Everyone look here and smile.
(laughing)
We're live, okay.
- Yes!
- We all feel like
we're going to throw up.
- We are, we're going
through and reading all
of our twitter comments
and I'm loving them.
I just figured we may as well sit here
with sweaty hands and nervous stomachs,
and say hi, even if we don't talk
and we're just sitting here.
- This is the icebreaker, I feel like.
- Yeah honestly it really is,
because I think it'll
either put us over the edge
and we'll all have heart attacks
or it'll kind of calm
us down as we do this.
- I think it's helping.
It's calming me down.
- It's either that or
it's the cold brisk wind
that's coming through the window.
- Yeah I'm like, can we close that window?
- It's currently 20 degrees outside
and we have the window open,
because we're so anxious.
Oh my gosh, there's almost 2,000 people
on our website right now.
- This means so much.
- That is crazy.
- And I think Julie's
comment is gonna make me cry.
She was the first on our Bollie page.
(laughing)
- Yay.
- Bonnie's cried, now it's my turn.
It's just really sweet, thanks Julie.
We're crying.
- Ahhh!
- We just got a text from Ruby.
The whole family is texting us,
this is so awesome.
Yes, our hands are
sweaty, Mom's spaghetti.
Oh my gosh.
That's incredible, look,
3,600 live right now.
- It's like what on earth?
-  Almost 4,000
today, this is amazing.
Look at what you guys have done!
- I'm trying to like everyone's comment
- I know.
- so you know that I'm seeing it.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Just so hap--
(kiss)
- This is jaw dropping.
(chiming)
We have orders on the site.
- Erin, Jordan, Noelle, Lacy, Veronica,
Yasmin, Liz and Sabrina,
guys we're dying.
- You guys are our first customers.
This is amazing.
- Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
_ Liz.
- I'm trying to figure out
why my Dad hasn't bought anything yet.
- Yeah Dad.
- Oh my gosh!
Honestly I was like what
if we don't get one sale.
- And then I thought well,
that was just a crazy year then.
(laughing)
- Worth it.
- Thank you, thank you guys.
- Thank you so much.
-  Joely, do you see that?
-  Yes.
- Yeah Mom!
- yeah!
(laughing)
- Thanks Mom.
- Your Mom bought your stuff.
Oh my gosh.
My stomach is turning just
looking at this on the ground.
That is an empty BeanBoozled carton.
Do you know what that means?
- Ooh, they ate all the gross ones.
-  They ate all of them.
- I ate one earlier and I
was like, I don't know why,
that's what his treat this week was.
And I was like no.
- What the heck?
Oh my gosh, did they eat them all?
-  They did.
Lincoln would take it out and be like ooh,
that's disgusting, and then I'd look over
and he'd put it in his mouth.
- And he'd put it right
back in, oh my gosh.
Boys did you eat all the
BeanBoozled jellybeans?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
-  Were they
good or were they nasty?
- There were the disgusting ones,
but that blue one was kinda sour.
-  Oh good, Jackson
what did you think?
They were all good?
- The blue ones were good.
-  The blue ones are good?
Which one tasted the bad, the worst?
- Scrambled eggs.
- The scrambled eggs?
Yeah the rotten eggs is
probably the worst one,
you could ever get,
if you've ever done the
BeanBoozled challenge.
We did the BeanBoozled challenge
for Jackson's third birthday.
I'll have that linked down below
for you guys to see.
- One two three four.
-  Wow, there is four.
- Careful.
(yelling)
- You gotta tip it,
Jared you gotta tip it.
Give it up, give it up.
-  Can all you
kiddies blow this out
with all your patience
with Mommy and Daddy a
little crazy this year.

We are currently learning about teeth
and dentists and what the dentist will do
if you eat a ton of chocolate cake
and don't brush your teeth.
- I want to eat the chocolate cake.
- You want to eat the chocolate cake?
(Calvin vocalizing)
- I want to take them out.
-  And we are learning
that we need to always
brush our teeth.
Where's the toothbrush?
Yes, make sure to brush the teeth good
after you eat the cake.
Okay?
Is this what we do
every night and morning,
is we brush our teeth too?
- Touch this, that's the red.
-  The red one?
- It's my red.
My red, this one, this one.
- Wow, that's your red.
- My red.
-  Brush brush brush.
- That looks awesome.
For dinner, we thought
we would go out and eat
or order in, but to be honest,
we don't have a lot of nerves
and I don't think anyone
has a huge appetite,
so tuna fish sandwiches for the win.
That is dinner tonight.
- Here you go one,
-  Something light.
- Three oh!
Two spins?
(laughing)
-  Penny what happened?
-  Did it fall down the stairs?
-  Oh no.
-  Is Jackson getting if for you?
- Woo, thanks Jacks.
- Yay!
-  We won't throw
it downstairs again, huh?
- Because she's nice.
-  Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Because she's nice.
-  What book do you want?
- Dog book.
- Peppa Pig.
-  The dog book?
Okay.
- No!
-  What?
Peppa Pig?
Oh you're stepping on
it, it's right there.
- No it's pig.
- That's Peppa Pig.
We're trying to find the
perfect Peppa Pig book.
I don't know where it went?
(harmonica playing)
Beautiful song for bed.
Dad, what chapter of
book are we on tonight?
It's called Let's Go Shopping.
Did you do that on purpose?
- No, this is the next story in line.
-  Okay.
- Peppa Pig puppy.
-  He wants his other Peppa.
This is what we're reading right now.
- One morning, Peppa and her family
took a trip to the supermarket.
Peppa and George jumped out
of the car in excitement.
They loved visiting the supermarket.
- One two three four, I'm that many.
- Yes you are that many.
- Yeah.
-  She skipped off
to put them in the cart.
- It's already one o'clock.
- Oh it's one o'clock, then
you should probably go to bed,
it's way past your bedtime.
It's past our bedtime too Mom.
- One o'clock.
- Yes.
-  I love you, my baby boys.
That's one way to sleep.
- Wake up.
- Wake up.
- Wake up.
- Wake up.
-  Okay the clock
is blue, what do we do?
- Dad, we don't go to sleep yet.
-  Is the clock yellow?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- It is the end to a long journey.
We have finally been able to launch
and we just want to say
thank you guys for your love
and for your support.
We have loved today, we have
loved your interactions.
I can't wait to go to the warehouse
and pack up some items tomorrow.
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.
- Most of all, we are so excited,
because this is just the beginning
and we have a lot of
huge ambitions and goals
that we want to hit
and we are just excited for the future.
And that is from us to you guys,
we cannot wait to see you guys tomorrow.
So do you want to say anything?
- Well I am just so excited
that we've been able to start this
and I cannot wait to see where we take it
and where we go with you.
