- Jared and I are going to have
lunch somewhere very special
and we want you guys to come along.
(lively music)
We've been married six years.
- Today.
- We have two kids.
- Today.
- And today we are excited
to say that we are home.
This is our home.
We cannot wait to have the kids play
in the backyard.
I cannot wait put flowers
in the front yard.
We cannot wait to put our kids to work
and make them mow the lawn
and plant a garden.
This is home.
(upbeat music)
- 
We're building a house.
(Ellie screams)
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
-  This is where
we're gonna build our house.
We're gonna build our future.
We're gonna grow our family
right on this property.
(upbeat music)
