I've got the food laid out my casserole
just got done time to start a party well
I think we're gonna get started um it
actually isn't too crazy in here
considering how many kids we have not as
bad about it's like I fit I figured it'd
just be really loud and crazy because at
Mom's house they can disperse but it's
really nice um I think we're going again
I say I wouldn't say anything about the
too loud and crazy just yet okay Glenda
it'll get therefore loud and crazy but
um thank you guys for coming to
Jackson's birthday a lot of his cousin's
brought rocks I think Cody has a little
ball in there for him and and so I think
what we're going to do is we'll have a
prayer on the food we can eat and the
kids there are really cool geode rocks
in here and there's some sock that you
can put the rock in and then a hammer
and you hit it once and it's a really
pretty and the inside so kids can help
they can do that I think each kid can
have two rocks and then you can do
whatever the rest so Jared well beau you
guys are the first to arrive I was
really open for some black tape on the
present I think Jackson might be a
little disappointed so go ahead tell me
what you were saying about this this is

Cody who's Rapids all by himself and he
said dad I really need some like real
tape to go in my tool bag he wanted to
wrap that in black tape so sorry you got
