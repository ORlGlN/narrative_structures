- Of me holding a snake
and it's trying to bite me,
and so I'm holding its neck really tight--
- Hey, there's my Tony Stark.
Waa!
(laughing)
-  We're doing
this for the third baby!
-  Good morning sweet girl.
How are you?
That was a fun surprise.
Waa!
(laughing)
She's trying to do zoomies in my office.
Oh my gosh what a pleasant surprise.
So I've been in my office this morning
getting the video uploaded
and Ellie let Penny--
Here she comes!
Ellie let Penny out of her kennel
and my favorite thing is when she comes
zooming into my office.
That's the first things she does.
Ellie let her out and
she came straight to me.
'Cause you're my dog, aren't you?
You're my sweet girl, huh?
Oh, that is such a good default down.
Okay now we can approach
you and say hello.
Oh, that's my girl.
That's my girl, oh good girl.
There it is.
(laughing)
Good morning guys.
-  These daisies have
lasted two weeks in there
and these little flowers,
they haven't quite lasted
as long as I've wanted,
but I think I'm gonna cut these ones
and put them over here.
I love having these here,
it's just so cheerful.
- This one's not beautiful.
Let's cut this one.
(Ellie laughs)
Say cheese.
- Cheese.
-  Mommy say cheese.
- Cheese.
Ooh, isn't that pretty?
-  Yeah.
-  Alright, doesn't
that look so cheerful?
- Yes they do!
- Those are the leftover flowers.
Jackson and I just got done watching
some videos of when Penny
was a brand new puppy
and it was so sweet.
Jackson was like, did she have sharp teeth
and I was like, she did.
We had to teach Penny
to be good to the kids
and the kids to be good to Penny.
And it's just, she is
such a good girl guys.
I would never have been able
to do this five months ago.
She would've been too
wound up, running all over.
It's just nice that she's
grown up a little bit.
She's a year and a half.
She's just getting so big, huh girl?
I just love watching little videos of her
when she could fit under the couch, huh?
You would run under the couch.
And you would hide and you
would sleep under there.
We had to teach her not to rip at the rug
at the edge.
She's been so good.
Aww, Penny girl.
What's in your mouth?
One of the kids' wrappers or something?
What are you doing?
A little update on Penny,
you're doing so good.
I really enjoy Penny.
There's been many man days of frustrations
just because at the time
we had even smaller babies
and then a puppy.
You know, she's still a puppy,
but you're just a good puppy.
She just has learned to behave
and it's just been really nice, huh?
And you're happy.
You played outside in
the front yard today.
we don't let her in the
front yard a whole ton,
because she will just run wild
and then we have the neighbor dog
that she goes and plays with,
but today she stayed right
by Jared's side, huh,
right by the kids' side.
You're just soft, huh,
even if I put my fingers in your mouth,
you're just soft.
I love that about labs.
I've never head another kind of dog,
we've just always had labs
and she's just soft.
Never has she bit,
I mean obviously being puppy teeth,
but you're just a good girl, huh?
Huh, sweet Penny.
Okay, where's Dad's office?
Where's his office?
Where do you always run to, huh?
Where?
Penny Penny Penny.
Ooh drop, good girl.
Where's Dad's office?
That's her favorite spot,
as you can see this morning.
This is where she goes
and then she says hello.
- Hello.
-  Hasn't she been so good?
I feel like we haven't
talked about her tons,
but I'm just thinking about you
and how much life has changed.
- She's been a good doggo.
- And you know what I can't wait for?
I was telling Bonnie,
I was like I'm excited
to bring a new baby home
and introduce Penny to a new baby
and see how she reacts.
When my parents got our lab growing up,
my mom said that our dog just
knew not to mess with me,
like she just was so soft around me.
And Bonnie was like, instincts
are real and uncontrollable.
And isn't that so true,
have you ever had an
instinct and you just do it
and you're like, I'm sorry I just jumped
and grabbed someone else's kid,
when I saw them falling
and it was just your
instinct and you just do it.
Dogs have those instincts too, huh,
and I'm excited to see
her with the new baby.

(Ellie laughs)
- Are you talking about Penny?
-  I'm laughing at you.
- Why?
-  'Cause you're cute.
- I don't want you to laugh at me.
-  I think it's cute
that you keep singing her songs.
- Uh-huh.
-  Look how she lays guys.
Look at her legs.
- I love when she stretches
her body out like that.
- I've never seen a lab do that.
Or I guess, my old lab never did that,
that I remember.
It is so funny.
-  She's just like stretch it out.
-  And of course,
she doesn't like her pillow.
- She will sit on it every once in awhile.
Like when she's really tired,
she's like, okay I'll sit on it,
but she likes the hardwood
floor for some reason.
-  It's cool to her.
- Yeah.
Sorry Dad, I'm not gonna sit
on the expensive new pillow
you got for your office,
I'm just gonna sit on the hard hard floor.
Just as long as you scratch my ears.

- Other way, twist it
toward, yeah towards you.
- Okay.
-  Yeah, just twist it like that.
There you go.
Oh, let's get it back in there.
Okay now twist.
You gotta push on it while you twist, too.
Keep going, you're doing
great, good job bud.
Welcome to the party Penny.
- Fixing your car?
- [Ellie[ Well she just took that ball
and it whipped Jackson's head.
- You gonna help Penny, too?
Okay, just push it in there and turn.
-  Okay Jared, we're
doing this for the third baby!
- Can you believe that?
It's pretty cool we're
getting two babies worth
out of this crib.
-  Where's my bed?
(Ellie laughs)
-  Where's my bed?
-  Calvin, is this
gonna be for baby brother?
- No, my bed.
-  It's your bed?
You haven't slept in here in a few weeks.
- I want to do this.
- Okay.
-  Is this gonna
be baby brother's, huh?
- Is this gonna be your baby brother's?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
Is this the baby's bed?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah and where's your bed?
- Down?
- Downstairs, that's right.
- Yeah right.
- Yeah right.
- I'm gonna do another one.
-  Good job.
-  Me.
- You want to try it?
Come turn that.
Okay, turn it this way.
Good job Calvin.
You guys are such good helpers.
Okay, get your hand off it,
'cause it's gonna come down.
- Alright we have the baby's bed coming.
Penny girl, you're being good in here.
Jackson, get off of my phone.
- No!
-  The boys were playing.
- My phone!
-  Your phone?
-  Alright we have
the baby's crib going.
The boys are happy building with us.
Can you believe that
George has been around
since you Jackson?
-  George has been
with us for a long time.
(Calvin yells)
-  Yep.
-  Here's the baby's baby blanket.
- Isn't that sweet?
- It's so soft.
-  It's soft?
- Soft.
-  Yeah.
- He's gonna love it.
-  Okay, let's put it on.
- He's gonna love it.
-  You know what, we're gonna have
to change that picture.
Sorry, Calvin, you've been evicted.
- Or we'll just leave
it, you're the third kid.
(Jared laughs)
(boys laughing)
Isn't that cute?
(laughing)
-  Goodnight guys.
Take a nap.
Bye.
Mommy and Daddy are going on a daaaaate.
-  No!
(Jared laughing)
- Well it is almost all the way done.
The crib is assembled and I
love what we've done so far.
We have a combination of old and new.
Ellie and baby.
- The baby bedding is coming.
The only thing we got
is a little crib thing
to guard the top and it's a skirt
and it's just green, it's green leaves.
So it'll be really pretty
with the touch of green
of this that my mom made.
And--
-  It's just sweet.
- This is feeling very sweet.
-  Yeah.
Hey, are you having a hard
time getting those on?
- Yeah.
-  Would you like some help?
- No.
-  Okay you want to do it.
Look at you go Ironman,
you're doing it all by
yourself, great job.
Hey, there's my Tony Stark.
- Your thing just came
through for me to accept.
-  In one hour later.
- Okay now.
- Okay.
-  Now we gotta buckle you up.
- You need new ones.
-  Mmm-hmm, you're
growing up too fast.
- Mmm-hmm.
-  Yes you are,
are you big and strong?
Show me your muscles.
Wow you are so strong.
- So I am 20 weeks, I
will be 21 weeks this week
and I want to do a little update
for the end of our vlog.
I have been tickled as we
have been getting this room
set up and I have a little list of things
of how I've been feeling.
So I have been having a lot
of back pain and pressure
this week, I have noticed.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And I am continuing to
go to the chiropractor.
- And I feel like that's
been one of the best things
that you've been doing for yourself.
- Totally.
- Absolutely,
your headaches are going away.
- Night and day.
- And I feel like your
back pain has lessened.
It's still there, but it's lessened.
- I did have an appointment set up
to go get the inner
part of my ear pierced,
that helps with migraines,
but he said he can't do pregnant women.
I'm sure there are some places that would,
but this guy said he,
for liability reasons
or something, he doesn't,
- Mmm-hmm.
- And it would've been nice,
because I feel like it
still would help me,
but going to he chiropractor
alone once a week
has completely changed me.
My body feels better,
my back feels better,
just everything is good,
so I am very glad that I'm doing that.
- And I'm glad that the
appointments aren't too long.
You're there for 15 minutes
and boom, done.
- Yeah.
- Totally.
I feel the baby a lot.
Jared quite hasn't felt tons of kicks,
but he's definitely felt his body.
- Yeah, when I push on certain areas,
I can feel where the baby is
and then the baby's like,
Dad, stop pushing on me
- And then he moves
- and then he goes somewhere else.
(laughs)
- I have noticed that my
skin has gotten much better.
There was a long time that I was having
a ton of breakouts, like
on my chest, my back
and my face, but I've
noticed that everything
just kind of seems calm right now.
I am getting a lot more full,
like swelling when I wake up.
My hands are really full.
I need to drink more water,
but I'm definitely feeling the pressure,
the fullness right now.
- Especially on our trip to San Francisco.
When we were at the airport,
- Yes.
- And on the airplane,
I definitely could tell that you had
a little swelling going on
in your feet and your hands.
Now for me, my chest area,
I've been having some breakouts there,
(Ellie laughs)
like one or two but--
- Do your nipples hurt?
- Not so much yet,
- Okay.
- But I feel like they're getting
a little tingling sensation on,
and maybe that's just
the lactation coming,
I'm totally kidding.
- Oh my gosh,
- I'm gonna keep going.
My dreams have been out of this world.
- Yes they have and I feel bad.
- I've been having dreams
that Jared and I fight a lot.
And in our day to day life,
life has been good.
- Yeah, our arguments have
decreased quite a bit.
- We haven't been fighting
and so it's kind of interesting
that all my dreams are is about me
fighting with him.
And then I've had two
dreams of me holding a snake
and it's trying to bite me,
and so I'm holding its neck really tight,
so he can't bend down and bite me,
but then he'll get away and he'll bite me.
And I looked it and it was like,
are you feeling insecure with life,
are you feeling stressed in life,
are you having doubts and I'm like--
- Have you been watching Indiana Jones?
- No, but my dreams have
been out of this world.
- If you guys are dream interpreters,
let us know in the comments down below
what it means.
- I am going to be doing a
huge baby haul on Monday.
I'm gonna film it, and that's
gonna be a whole video,
because I'm just gonna talk
tons about baby products.
When Jared and I went to San Francisco,
I was looking at bassinets,
between the Halo and the Snoo.
And we met Dr, what's his name?
- Harvey something.
He's the author of
Happiest Baby on the Block,
Happiest Toddler on the Block
and I said if you need any help
to write Happiest Husband on the Block
I'm a good example to use because--
- He thought that was funny.
- I'm the happiest husband on the block.
- It was awesome to meet him and--
- Harvey Salk?
Something like that.
- But I've gone back and forth,
because I am so happy spending an amount
on a baby item.
I do not have a problem with that.
When we bought this rocking chair,
it was quite a bit,
and it was hard to do,
because it's like, do we
really need to spend that much?
But it's the one thing that I was like,
we're gonna have it for
years and years to come.
I want it to be really comfy.
I'm glad we spent the money on it.
- If it makes a difference,
it's worth it.
For example, we bought the Mamaroo,
- And that's expensive
- because we heard so many great things.
And it's expensive.
In fact, we bought it twice.
- For each baby.
- and we returned them both times,
because it just didn't make the difference
that we were looking for.
- And our babies just didn't like it.
- Right.
- Like it was narrow on their--
they just didn't like it.
And so we ended up returning them.
And I told Jeremy, I'm
like maybe we'll just wait
until the baby comes and if
he's colicky like Calvin was,
maybe then we'll get it.
But Jared just told me today
that they're having 40% off of it,
and I'm like ah dangit.
- Yeah.
- We're probably going
to get the Snoo bassinet,
just because of the ratings,
the background, the history,
the discount.
- Honestly,
- Do you want to tell them about it,
you're the tech guy.
- Well yeah, so real quick,
I would love to get the Snoo and the Halo.
- No way.
(Ellie laughs)
- Just to test 'em and
just see the difference.
I would personally love to do that,
- Okay.
- but that's the tech guy in side of me
to be like okay, let's compare 'em
and see what's one best, but real quick--
- Okay, I shouldn't shoot that down.
- That's okay.
- If that's something that would be fun
to make a video on and
it would help people,
maybe we would do that.
- Yeah, let us know in
the comments down below
if you would like to see that
and I'm dead serious.
- Yeah.
- But the Snoo, essentially what it does,
is there's four S's in soothing your baby,
which is what the doctor
designed this for.
There's, I can't remember them all,
shushing, soothing, sleeping,
something like that.
But it moves the baby a little bit
and then it does white noise.
And it varies, based on the crying.
It'll move a little bit more
if the baby's crying.
If the baby's quiet and asleep,
it'll move less.
There's even a weaning option,
that you can connect with your Smartphone,
that's the other thing is it connects
with your Smartphone,
so you see and hear
everything that's going on.
That will slowly transition
into crib sleeping
at six months.
And so there's lot of tech inside of this,
it's really beautifully designed.
And it's just smart.
And I don't think it was around
when we had Jackson or Calvin.
- Oh totally not, or I
might have been like,
that might be worth
it, we're gonna try it.
I was desperate.
- And the Halo Bassinet is cool,
because it swivels right onto your bed,
so it can be right next to you
for really great co-sleeping
and it bends down, so
you can reach in and out
really easily from your bed.
And I think it was designed with mothers
who have had C-sections
and makes it easy for
recovery with C-sections.
- Jared knows more about this than me,
because of the tech.
(laughing)
I did not know that.
- The Snoo is way more expensive
than the Halo, so that's also
something to keep in mind.
- Yeah.
- But benefits and cons and I think
that's why I want to do the test.
- Okay my first initial reaction was
heck no, we're not
gonna, we don't need two,
but to make a video purpose,
that might be nice.
So that's our update.
I emotionally am feeling better this week
than I was a few weeks ago.
A few weeks ago, I had
picked up the camera
and I was like nevermind,
I just can't, but the last
week has been very good,
because I've been feeling better.
- And I think some of it has to do
with you can see the sun is just shining.
It's getting a little warmer.
And I feel like that
has a small part to play
in that too.
- Totally.
- Totally.
We're excited for baby.
Jackson, Calvin every day, baby?
And he'll look at my tummy, every day.
It is very sweet.
The bedding is gonna come soon.
We've got the blanket my mom made.
Of course, all my boys
have Minky blankets.
He has his right here waiting.
So this is it.
This is life right now.
- We are getting ready for our baby.
This is the nursery room
and we're getting it all set up.
- Yep, this is our La-Z-Boy
that we bought for Jackson and it's been--
- Oh what did you say?
This is your 20 week
update, you're 20 weeks?
-  Yeah.
- Oh my gosh.
-  And can you
believe we've had all
of our babies with this?
- This is the best.
-  And we're gonna
have it the rest of our lives.
You know?
(Jared sighs)
- I'm gonna take a nap.
- Okay.
Thank you guys so much for watching
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
Look at the sun, it's beautiful.
Bye guys.
-  Bye!
-  Bye baby.
