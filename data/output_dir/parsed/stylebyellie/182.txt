(somber music)
(laughing)
- He was like waiting.
Ewwwa!
(laughing)
I like getting chocolate milk bubbles
all over my head.
(gentle guitar music)
Penny has arrived.
Ladies and gentlemen, Penny has arrived.
That's chocolate milk, not blood.
Good morning guys.
Jared ended the vlog yesterday without me.
I was starting to end it,
and then I was getting flustered,
and then I had Jared end it.
This morning, we are getting ready
to go in to the hospital
so that I can have a D&C.
I'm not looking forward to it.
I'm not quite sure how
to handle my emotions.
Have lots of rage.
(laughs)
-  Well I think part of it is
- I laugh because I feel awkward.
- I think part of it is that
this ist he last thing that you wanted
to have happen in the miscarriage.
You wanted to do it naturally,
and that didn't work.
You wanted to do it with the medicine
and that didn't work.
And now it's like, this
is the last resort.
And it's not a fun resort to go visit.
- No no.
The medicine did a little bit,
but they need to go in,
and we need to do that.
I do have a battle
wound forever on my wall
that I will look at.
There it is, the battle wound.
I chucked the camera at it yesterday.
So you guys are good,
but I'll forever look at that and
-  Remember that one time
- I'm not even gonna
patch it, I love it, so.
- Memories.
(gentle guitar music)
- I told Jared I'm not doing that again,
in a cleaner version,
but that's how I feel,
so that's what you get.
- The truth hurts, right?
- The nurse is like, she was so cute.
- She was.
- She gave me a hug and she was like,
I have had to do this three times
and I am so sorry.
It was just cute,
we just had a good conversation.
- She said, I'm not even
gonna ask you how you are.
I just know this sucks.
- Yeah, so cute.
Okay, warm side, like that.
-  Alright, and
Judy's gonna be your nurse,
she'll be right down.
- It's perfect.
(laughing)
- I just looked at Jared
and he's like Ellie you're beautiful.
He said you know what you need to do?
- I said you should
really try and put some
waves in your eyebrows.
- How about when they
give me the anesthesia
and I'm asleep, you do it.
So I can wake up and feel beautiful.
Take note.
- Do you have an eyebrow pencil in here?
-  No.
- I'll be right back.
-  But we should,
you should do them.
- We should really make
a video of that sometime.
I saw that on something, and I was like,
is that really a trend right now?
- I've thought about it, but I'm like,
but I just don't want to.
But you're good and
artsy, you could do it.
- I'll do it for you.
I'll do it for you, okay, for you.
- Thanks.
We've been talking about Penny too,
and how funny she is and
how pets are so cute.
And Jared put her on our bed last night
and she knew it was something special.
It was crazy.
- Cuddled up to us to us like really cute,
and was like, I'm up here with you guys.
(tender music)
I'm sorry.
- Come.
- No.
- Okay.
-  Good luck.
- Well I wish they
would've put me to sleep
with him in the room.
-  Yeah.
(gentle atmospheric music)
(TV in background)
(soft crying)
(crying)
- Yeah, thank you, you're so sweet.
- Thank you so much.
- Take care, okay?
- You're so sweet.
- Thank you so much.
- You alright?
-  Yeah.
(belt snaps)
- We just got home from the hospital
and Ellie is already
feeling so much better,
her spirits are a lot higher
and she is doing really really great.
How are you feeling?
- That could be
because I got food in my tummy?
- That is a big part of it.
You know what?
We have Beau and Emily to thank for that.
They sent us an Olive Garden gift card
and we are snacking on the Olive Garden.
- So thank you.
Bonnie came to say hi.
- I felt like I was
being a little intrusive.
-  Not at all.
- Like I wanted to be
there when you get home,
but I just couldn't stand the thought
of your body going through so much,
I just wanted to meet you here.
-  Well thanks.
- Well thank you guys.
Sometimes I feel like
Bonnie's married to Ellie
just as I am.
(laughing)
- Well she came in and
she got on the couch
and she goes c'mere c'mere.
Like I'm here.
(laughing)
- Bonnie called while
we were in the hospital
and was like, is Ellie having
a hankering for me right now?
(laughing)
- I did, I said does she need me?
- I was like, I'm here.
- We did
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- We did laugh really hard.
-  It was like a
10 minute conversation,
we were laughing.
- Usually she is.
-  I know.
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Like on a scale of one to
10, how bad does Ellie want me?
(laughing)
- It was cute.
-  It was.
- Afterwards though, the
nurses were helping me
and I was on the bed,
and I was like, there's so much blood,
I can feel the blood.
And then she's like you
didn't put your pad on right.
(laughing)
So there was like
I was a hot mess, I went to the bathroom,
and they didn't tell me it
was gonna hurt to pee either.
They move your bladder or
go around it or whatever.
And I tried to pee and I was like no!
It hurt.
- Stop stop stop stop.
-  This pee is on fire.
- So they said it will
hurt for a little bit.
- Yeah.
But I'm just happy that Ellie's home.
She's feeling a lot better.
We're gonna take it easy
for the next couple of days though, okay?
Like I don't want you
doing any jump roping
or anything like that,
that's ridiculous, why would
you even think about that?
- I did my laundry,
I did a few loads last night,
so I'm gonna just sit.
-  Yep, good.
- And you can do the dishes.
- I will do the dishes.
Do you guys want to stick around
and maybe we could do
some dishes together?
(laughing)
Oh I was also gonna say
the kids are actually
with Grandma and Grandpa.
They have been taking naps,
so this is actually like the perfect time,
when the kids are asleep,
Ellie's getting food in her belly,
and getting her spirit's lifted.
- Jared said when I was
coming out of the anesthesia
I said, I just want Penny here.
- It was so funny.
You didn't go on about Jackson and Calvin.
You literally said,
and I wish I caught it,
I just wish Penny was here.
- Well I think we had been
talking about Penny a lot.
What a sweet girl she is
and how we just like you Miss Penny,
Miss pretty Penny.
And she's pretty good in the house,
but I think specifically like right now,
she's been so just mellow.
- I think maybe she kind of, you know,
Dogs are so sweet.
- senses something.
- Dogs are very smart
when there's a crisis.
- Maybe she's just being extra cute
because Dad let you on the bed.
(laughing)
That was hilarious.
Well I think I'm gonna go take a nap
- I think that's a great idea.
-  and then the kids will be here.
(tender music)
- Ellie was able to get
a little bit of rest.
The kids are home and
we are reunited together
as a family.
Hi boys, how's it going?
- We're watching Spider-Man.
- Yes, and we thought it
would be a great opportunity
for us to watch a movie
together as a family.
So we got some popcorn.
Look, it's Mickey Mouse.
Grab your popcorn Calvin
and Jackson, here you go.
And Mommy, here you go.
- Thanks.
- Jackson wanted to watch Spider-Man.
And this is the first time we've ever
seen a life action movie.
- Actually I want to watch Spider-Man,
because I didn't really want to watch,
Captain Underpants again.
But I wanted us to sit
down and enjoy a show too,
so we'll see how they like it.
-  Yeah, I think
Jackson will love this movie.
(whispers) Yeah he is.
(dramatic music on TV)
yeah.
I think it's important to know
that we have been skipping a lot
of the scary scenes,
just basically showing
the origin of Spider-Man,
not the Green Goblin
or anything like that.
Jackson did you like Spider-Man?
- Yes.
-  Was it a good movie?
- Yeah, I don't like when Octopus
-  Yeah, he was kind of bad, huh?
Did he make bad choices or good choices?
- Bad ones.
-  Do we make good choices?
- Yeah.
-  Good.
- We skipped 90 percent of that.
(laughing)
But it was fun to see
him be excited about it.
- Yeah.
I mean when Spider-Man
was becoming Spider-Man,
that was pretty cool.
- Yeah.
What was your favorite part of Spider-Man?
- Shooting webs was cool.
- This has been by far the worst week
I have ever have,
but I do want Jared to know
how much I absolutely love him.
I don't feel like
Of course we know it,
but sometimes I don't
feel like I express it
as much as I should.
And I love you.
And thanks for being here more for me
than I am for you.
It's just kind of how it is naturally,
but I do love you.
- I love you and I'm always
gonna be here for you.
-  Thanks.
I love you too.
- Well guys what about me?
You're not talking about
me, what's going on?
I want to be included in this.
Oh guys.
- My friend friend the other day,
you saw the painting she made.
A lot of people wanted
to know her Instagram.
So I'm sure she's okay with it,
but I'm just gonna double check with her
before I say it,
and then on Instagram,
when we hang our picture,
I'll definitely make sure
to give her info there.
But she gave us a sweet little gift.
(Ellie laughs)
- Penny.
-  Awww.
- Awww.
-  It is so pretty.
- It's like a mini version
of our giant painting.
-  I love it.
- How cool is that?
-  Aww, thanks friend.
It is beautiful.
- She is so talented.
And I can, I think it's fresh.
- Let me (laughs)
Hey I like paint.
-  Don't sniff too much.
- I want to sniff lots.
- It's beautiful.
While it has been a difficult week,
I definitely feel like especially today,
I have a really incredible sense of calm
and just a great sense of,
like this is a fresh start, you know,
and I don't know if
that's insensitive to say.
- Jared asked me that earlier,
and when it's me and you in our home,
I know what you mean,
- Yeah.
- and I hope everyone
portrays that in a good way.
But I know what you mean
and it's been like a drug out week,
and it's been kind of like
just a drug out few months anyway.
- When we talked with the
doctor and everything,
she was so glad that
we ended up doing this,
because of, just the way things were.
- Yeah the doctor, she said,
I'm really glad that
you ended up doing this,
because, she said, you had a lot of tissue
that was very adhered in your lining,
and I'm all over the place right now.
And she said that it
wouldn't have been able
to pass on its own.
And so this was like the last
thing that I wanted to do.
I hated it, I hated being there.
I hated being cold.
I hated, I hated it.
- But it was necessary for you to be
in the best condition that you could be.
And I think that's why if
feels like a fresh start.
- Yes.
Like I feel at peace knowing
that my body can just recover now fully.
I would hate to have thought,
like okay it's probably good
and then have issues or whatever.
Just like last time, I
remember just a few days after,
I was like, why am I not blue?
Of course I was sad, but I was like okay,
and then I remembered
exactly a month later,
it was like a rollercoaster,
and that's exactly how this will be.
I could not help but just love love love
on my boys tonight,
I do every night, but extra, you know?
Just love my family,
I'm grateful for them.
- Well I love you.
- And I'm so grateful
for our extended family,
friends and you guys.
I've learned a lot
and I've asked my doctor
a lot of questions
through information that we've received,
and I've got a lot of answers.
We've done lots of blood work.
Just lots and lots and
lots, huh, Miss Penny girl.
- I just wish Penny was here.
I love that you said that.
- I did.
- She's so sweet.
- That was the sweetest thing.
- I've enjoyed my conversations
with my sisters, my sister-in-laws,
my friends, everyone that's been through
miscarriages or haven't.
I feel like miscarriages
gets talked about,
because it's like oh I had a miscarriage,
but I feel like sometimes
people do it so nonchalantly.
It's the most painful thing
that I have ever experienced.
This was by far more painful than my last.
My last I felt it in my back,
but this was
- Something else.
- This was something else
and I don't know if it was because
I was further along
or if my body was trying to get rid
of that lining that wasn't
I don't know,
but this has been an excruciating week.
We're gonna go ahead and say goodnight.
And can't wait to watch
101 movies tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to it.
- Absolutely.
Thank you for the kind words
that you guys have sent us.
Like we have seen your
Instagrams, your Tweets,
your YouTube comments,
your Facebook comments,
your emails, your comments on our website.
We've seen those.
We want to thank you for sending those,
because they mean a lot to us.
But we are gonna call it a night.
- I'm gonna go take a pain pill.
- We'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Maybe take two.
(laughing)
- Have a great weekend.
- The doctor's like, do
you have enough at home,
and I'm like nope, give me more.
I won't abuse them.
- Good, I'm glad.
- Okay, we'll see ya, bye.
- Okay, bye.
