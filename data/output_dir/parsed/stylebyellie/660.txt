favorite part about these little parties
is once the presents are all open the
kids go out and play out in the yard and
they have tons of fun and we just get to
sit and talk and that's like one of my
favorite things that we've done with
Ellie's family just through the years is
like from the very first time that I met
them is we just sit and talk and have a
good time with each other
converse and enjoy each other's company
