- Do you guys remember last night
when I was like, I'm
gonna help Jared edit,
while he gets some work done.
(laughs)
I did help edit.
We went to bed at two o'clock.
But I got hardly the vlog edited,
probably like five minutes worth.
So Jared is finishing the vlog.
(upbeat music)
Woo hoo
Oh my gosh.
So that's what we're doing,
finishing the vlog, eating breakfast.
Gotta get ready.
- We are back from church
and today at church was the very first day
that I have, we call them callings,
it was like my new job
I guess you would say.
It's volunteer work.
I teach the kids music,
like the kids from four years old
to 12 years old.
I teach them music.
I lead the music and everything.
And I was nervous to
get up in front of them.
I had a little bit of butterflies
until we actually got going,
but then it was so much fun.
We laughed, we had fun
and we sang some fun songs.
What do you think about me
being the music teacher?
- I think it's so fun.
I think you're perfect.
And when Jackson goes
into class in one month--
- I know, I am so excited
that Jackson is gonna be in my class.
And I also do some,
some of the time, I'll do
what we call the nursery,
the kids who are 18
months to three years old.
I'll do some music with them too.
So it's just a lot of fun
and I'm really excited,
but church is over.
We're not talking about church anymore,
at least for the next little bit,
because we have a very special visitor
coming to our house
- We're done with church.
- We're done with church.
- We're done with church,
at least until next Sunday.
-  No.
- No I'm totally kidding, that's a joke.
We have a very special guest coming over
to our house, and he's our friend,
but also, he's very
special to us right now,
because he's helping
us with this IVF grant,
-  Which he did last year.
- which he did last year too.
- He was like one of the first people.
I guess they all were,
I don't know who was the first,
but I just remember him
just being very nice.
- Yes, very nice.
-  Generous.
- Zack, we'll see ya just in a little bit.
- You want to see my dance show?
-  Of course I do,
show me your dance show.
- No you have to sit on the couch.
- Oh okay, you're right.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
may I introduce to you tonight
for the very first time on the
main stage, Jackson Mecham.
Hit the highest music.
(bright music)
Woo yeah.
(music ends)
(bright music)
Yay, clap your hands everyone.
(claps)
Yay, good job boys.
Now take a bow.
(Jared laughs)
I hope you guys enjoyed
tonight's entertainment.
That was the Nutcracker
- It made me laugh.
-  by Jackson and
Calvin, or something like that,
Dance of the Sugar, the Sugar Kiss Fairy.
- You guys never had
cherry cordial before?
What are these called?
-  I don't know if you would
appreciate them that much.
- Yeah, much too good for children.
- Are you trying one of these?
- They are the best.
- Much too good for children.
- One of these?
- Chew it, see what you think.
- Take a bite.
-  Is it good?
(Jared laughing)
- Is it good?
- That's awesome.
-  Oh good.
Okay try it Cal.
(laughing)
Do you like it?
- Mmm-hmm.
- So we just had dinner.
We had our very special
friend Zack come over.
Hey bud, how's it going?
- Good.
- Good.
And we've just been talking about
everything under the sun,
YouTube, IVF grants and
all of that good stuff.
For those of you that don't know,
this is Zack who is one of our donors
for one of the IVF grants this year.
So thank you for being so generous,
thank you for taking the time
to come up here and have dinner with us.
We appreciate you.
- It's my pleasure.
Thank you for you guys for putting it on,
because it wouldn't be
possible without you guys.
-  That was just
a small part of this,
so thank you very much.
- Okay, should we kick him out now?
- Yeah, yeah we fed you.
(Jared laughing)
You gave us candy, so we're good.
- We fed you, you gave us candy,
we vlogged you, now it's time to go.
It's like MTV Cribs, get out of here.
I'm just kidding,
you can stay as long as you want.
We have a bedroom downstairs.
- So yeah.
- Okay, perfect.
- But he has a house, so.
-  Yeah, a home.
There it is, did you get it?
- Awww.
- Oh Calvin.
-  I knew he
wouldn't appreciate it.
-  Oh no!
(Jared yells)
-  Calvin.
-  He finally
took a bite out of it.
Like I said, much too good for children.
- Much too good for children.
- You want me to explain
what the cherry cordial is?
Maybe you have people who don't know.
-  Maybe you don't know, tell us.
- Alright, so cherry cordial,
I've probably had like 60
of these already today,
but inside of these,
so it looks like a normal kiss,
but inside of it is like
this gooey cherry stuff.
Let me see if I can cut this open,
This is what I do on my channel.
- I was gonna say,
- So do it like that.
-  you're just
right at home right now.
- So it's all this gooey,
cherry sugary stuff.
It is incredibly incredibly rich,
so like, not everyone likes it.
If you're the type of person
who can eat frosting
straight from the container,
you're gonna love it.
- See, see Dad?
- So it's not like a normal kiss,
you would say this is
more like a French kiss?
Is that what you would say?
- Better.
Better than a French kiss.
- Better than a French kiss.
- See Dad, I did it like this.
-  Oh let's see.
Oh yeah, good job bud, you did it.
Does it taste good?
Oh no, lick it.
Does it taste good?
- Bleeh.
(Jared laughing)
- There's lots of good kisses,
but my favorite are the candy cane ones,
because they have little
peppermint things on the inside,
little candy cane bits
on the inside of them.
And I just like to put 'em in my mouth
and let 'em melt in my mouth.
And oh it's the best.
He wanted the lips.
- No wait, I got a cold sore, right here.
-  Aww.
(Jared laughing)
- I literally after dinner,
I was like, I feel it,
like what the heck Ellie, what's wrong?
It happens when I'm pregnant,
hormones, everything.
Stress I guess, I don't know.
-  What is it?
- Cold sore.
(Jared gasps)
- I already said that.
So I put medicine on it.
Anyway, I am so proud--
I am so proud of our boys.
At the same time, different bathrooms,
they both had to go potty
and they both went.
- And they did.
- And I was like, this
is my life right now.
Mom life, happy.
- I know.
- Right, and in a minute,
we won't need diapers for about
-  Six more months.
- A couple months
and then we'll have to get
all different kinds of diapers.
But this is like a huge
parenting success okay?
You'll understand when you get there.
When both of your boys are using the potty
at the same time, it's
pretty incredible, okay?
Parents give me a thumbs
up for that right?
Give me a little high five.
You know, it was a lot of fun
having Zack come over to our house.
We've known Zack for what, two years now?
Is that about right, you think?
- I think so, I met him at the gym.
- Yeah and that was actually the story
that I was gonna tell.
It's so funny how we met.
The reason we met is because
Zack's sister actually watches our videos.
So hi Zack's sister.
And she had mentioned to Zack
that she saw his truck
in one of our videos,
when Ellie and Bonnie were at the gym.
And so she told Zack to go say hello
to Ellie and Bonnie at the gym.
And sure enough, this
muscular attractive guy
comes up to Ellie and Bonnie--
- He's like hey can I
get a picture of you,
I was like, sure.
- Of course.
And he's like oh I have
a YouTube channel too.
And the rest is history.
You know,
- So fun.
- we worked on some project together.
We filmed a lot of videos together
and Zack's a really great friend of ours
and we're so grateful
that he is part of the IVF grant again.
So thank you Zack for being our friend
and for being so generous to do this.
- You know what's funny is
I have my friends that I grew up with,
Jared has his, we both hung out with them,
but our married friends
have all come from YouTube.
- It's true.
- Like seriously, Carl and Jinger,
Missy, Cullen and Katie,
- and Bryan, Cullen and Katie.
- Like, just the people we hang with,
it's like oh yeah, we met you online.
- We met all our friends on the internet,
and that's okay to say in 2016, 2017.
And you know it's almost 2018.
But in 2006, stranger danger,
something like that, I don't know.
What was the saying?
- When I was still in high school,
that would have been dangerous.
- What's the saying,
2006, don't talk to strangers,
don't get candy from strangers,
don't talk online with strangers,
don't get in cars with strangers.
2017, I went online to
talk with a stranger,
to have them pick me up in their car,
from a stranger, to go
somewhere, something like that.
It's crazy how the world changes.
And that's where we are right now.
Ellie and I, one laptop,
two laptops, we're gonna
work on Sunday night.
It is 10:30 and we're about to go to work.
Are you ready for the second
shift at the Mecham household?
- Yes.
Don't think I'm like just ignoring you
and tweeting or whatever.
-  No you're working right now.
- I'm literally, yeah,
I'm texting, but--
- It's an important text message.
Who?
- I'm texting Landon.
- Landon?
My brother in law?
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
- Hey Landon, how ya doin'?
We're talking to you on the text message
right now, right now.
- I just don't want you
to think I'm being rude
by ignoring you.
- I don't think you're
rude right now at all.
We had another special
little visitor today.
I'm not sure if you noticed,
but while Ellie and I were working,
we had a little guest
come out and visit us.
(Calvin snoring)
He's quite the snorer.
I think he gets that from Ellie.
Hey you.
I love you.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight sweetie.
I think we both pulled a Jared tonight.
I think we both fell asleep on the couch
just for a little bit
as we were working.
We are zonked.
But we are ready for a brand new week.
Thank you guys for watching.
We are going to end it right here.
Have a wonderful day
and we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
