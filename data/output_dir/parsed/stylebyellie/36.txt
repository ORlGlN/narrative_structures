- I had no idea posting
an Instagram picture
would cause so much controversy.
- He was snoring pretty loud.
- She loves this color.
I love you Mom.
- Why does he sleep so much?
Would you hate it if we tried
to make veggie egg rolls too?
-  I wouldn't hate it.
- Should we try or no?
- Let's just make it easy.
(laughs)
We've had a busy morning.
As soon as I got home from the gym,
we uploaded Ellie and
Bonnie's make-up video
on Ellie's channel.
I got another video edited
and then we filmed a video,
another Ellie and Bonnie video
that's gonna go up on Ellie's channel.
When is it Tuesday?
-  It's every other.
- Every other, so something like that.
We'll let you know when it's posted, but--
Oh you found my controllers?
Thanks bud, I appreciate that.
Hey, while you're here, stick around.
Show me what's going on over here.
What'd you do?
- Straw.
-  A straw.
- This one.
- Yeah, what's in the straw?
- Wow.
-  Is there dirt in the straw?
- Oh and you have my tape.
Can I have that?
- Yeah.
- Don't go get my tape.
(Jared laughs)
- Calvin is getting in the straws,
the tape and the Nintendo Switch.
And you've got dirt in your
hair, too, right there.
Is that for you to drink?
Yeah, where did you get all those straws?
- I have to do these away.
-  Are you gonna put 'em away?
- Mmm-hmm.
-  Oh thank you buddy,
I appreciate your help cleaning up.
- Mmm-hmm.
(flushing)
- What did you do?
- Big poop.
- You did a big poop.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good job, high five.
Where's your potty watch?
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
(Ellie laughs)
Don't throw it away.
Not again Calvin, not again.
Why does he sleep so much?
- Because he's tired.
-  Do you want to put it in?
Me, you hold it, perfect.
(gentle music)
I had no idea posting an Instagram picture
would cause so much controversy.
Okay I posted a picture about--
It really wasn't controversy.
I posted a picture about s'mores
and how I really don't like
to use regular Hershey
chocolate with my s'mores,
I like to use Reese's Peanut
Butter Cups or Mr. Goodbars.
And so many of you gave
awesome suggestions,
you're like we like to
use Ghirardelli Chocolate,
we like to use strawberries,
you like to use strawberry
marshmallows with chocolate
and I'm like, you guys
gave the best suggestions
and then some people
think it's a little weird.
I picked up the marshmallows,
we have graham crackers, picked up those.
And then I also picked up
some good chocolate for Mama.
And when we do marshmallows next time,
I don't know if we're gonna do it tonight
or sometime, but soon,
we're gonna have even better s'mores
than we usually do.
(bright music)
All of this talk about college
and what we used to eat at college
has made Jared and I
have a very big appetite
for tuna fish sandwich.
So that is exactly what Jared is making.
So good, cut up pickles, yummy.
- It takes me back.
-  Memories.
- Oh my gosh yes.
Penny come!
Come here.
She's so distracted.
Good girl.
- Dad, there's a little bit of snow left.
-  There's just
a little bit of snow.
This is where we went sledding, huh?
- Yeah, I want to go see it.
-  Okay, go see it.
(gentle music)
Do you see it?
Do you want to sled on it?
- No, we don't have a sled.
- You're right.
Up up up up up up,
no you can't skip one.
There you go, have that.
-  Woo hoo.
Last year at this time of year
it was snowing a ton and it was freezing.
Very grateful for this warm weather
that we get to play in.
You're going the opp--
(gentle music)
Did you guys decide to do a train?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, make sure to choo choo.
- Choo choo.
- You ready?
- Yes.
- Put your arms in the air Jackson.
Put your arms in the air.
- Yeah.
(Jared laughing)
-  That was the shortest slide
that took the longest to--
- The set up took a long time,
but the execution was worth it.
- I want to lay down.
-  Why?
- Because the sunshine is gonna hit me.
-  Oh okay.
You just close your eyes.
-  Are you gonna fall asleep?
- Yes.
-  Okay goodnight.
(Ellie snores)
- Bye park.
- I'll miss you.
- Miss you.
- I'll see you later.
- See later.
- Say I love Mom.
- I love Mom.
- Say she's pretty cute.
- You're cute Mom.
- She's my favorite.
- She's my fave.
- But Dad's pretty cool too.
- Me too.
(laughing)
-  What are you looking for?
What did you call it?
- The rescuer.
-  Why do you need the rescuer?
- Because a marble's
trapped under the couch.
-  Okay well let's see
what you're gonna do with this.
Nice, did you get it?
- Yep.
-  Could you
reach the marble before?
- Yep.
-  With the rescuer you could?
That's pretty cool,
that's a pretty ingenious idea.
Good job, bud.
- Maybe there's some more things
under the couches.
-  Okay take a look and
see if you can grab anything.
(bouncing marble)
Uh-oh, before it gets under again.
Good job.
- I see a rock,
my rock that I got for Christmas.
I got it!
-  You got your rock?
- Yeah!
-  Good.
- There's more.
-  Is there more?
Okay.
- Hey guys, tomorrows Valentine's Day.
Let's get stuff for Mom!
I think Mom would like flowers.
Should we get Mom flowers?
- Yeah.
(bright jazzy music)
- Flower!
She loves this color.
-  She does?
- Yeah.
-  Do you think
we should get those ones?
- Yeah.
-  Do they smell good?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- And purple ones.
-  And purple ones?
-  Yeah.

- Mmm-hmm.

Happy Valentine's Day.
I love you Mom.
- I love you.
-  Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's to you and me.
Ellie just farted right
before I said that.
I'm sorry (laughs).
That's, hey, you're flawless,
oh my goodness gracious.
- I'm pregnant and I don't care.
Even if I'm not pregnant.
Okay, let's go.
- I don't even care.
- I wanted to say this,
one of my favorite things
about being married
or having a girlfriend
or anything like that,
having a significant
other, is doing a surprise.
And tomorrow, you have--
nothing crazy big, but
tomorrow's Valentine's Day
and I have a little surprise for you,
so I'm excited to give it to you.
- Even though we already got our gift.
- Mmm-hmm, yes we did.
- We'll tell you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
Now we're gonna go into my office
and we're gonna sit down
and we're gonna work a little bit more.
Just a little bit Ellie.
Hey, just a little bit.
- Listen really carefully.
- Downstairs.
- They are playing with their marble run.
- They are playing with their marble run
and as long as they're in bed,
I don't care.
I don't care, it's bedtime,
they're playing in their bed.
Oh my gosh.
- Listen, wait, I want to hear.
(boys vocalizing)
- Literally seconds ago, they were playing
in their bedroom.
-  Yeah, we didn't say anything.
- We didn't say anything.
And now they're in their bed,
laying down to go to sleep,
oh my gosh that's the ultimate dream.
Yeah, play in your room
before bed a little bit,
just as long as you're not in our way.
(laughs)
That's kind of a joke, but them laying--
-  Well it's kinda true.
When we say it's bedtime,
- Yeah, it's bedtime.
- it's bedtime.
-  Yeah.
- We read stories, said prayer, you know?
- Yeah and now it's
like okay it's bedtime.
-  That's sweet.
- They're in their bed,
they made that choice.
That's so sweet.
Are you watching them?
-  I'm trying, but I
don't know how to work this.
- It's cute, our little kids
are doing some great stuff.
-  How do you push play?
- Oh my gosh, this is something else.
I'm coming downstairs, be quiet.
Hey, you stop talking,
you gotta listen okay,
it's time to be quiet.
Oh Ellie already went down
here and shut the door.
I'll see if I can peek in.
Oh I'm an idiot for doing
this, why am I doing this?
I shouldn't do this.
They're so stinking cute.
(Jackson snoring)
Holy crap, did you hear that?
Ellie, you will not believe this.
-  What?
- Jackson snores just as loud as you do.
- I don't snore.
(laughing)
Are you being serious?
- He was snoring pretty loud.
- Do I snore?
-  He was snoring really loud.
- He's so tired.
-  I know.
- He crawled up in bed and was like,
he was done.
-  Yeah.
- Do I snore?
No it was just a joke,
just a little comedy for the vlog,
-  No, I'm curious.
- Just a little joke here and there
to make you smile.
- I'm curious because at
night if Jared snores,
I'm not nice, I just kick him.
-  Yeah.
- And I'm like shhh, and then he stops.
- Shhh and then I stop
and I fall back asleep and--
I don't snore that much do I?
Ellie will engage in fisticuffs with me.
-  One or the
other, it was really funny.
- So oh my gosh, the kids are in bed
and you know what, I'm ready for bed.
I am zonked.
I've been waking up at five
in the morning every day.
- I'm a little sad, because I
want to watch a show with you.
But that's okay.
- You know what?
- Let's watch a show until I zonk.
I'll stay up for the next five minutes
while you watch your show
and you watch without me
and just pretend I'm awake.
- I turned this off last
night, because it was lame,
but I'm gonna finish it.
- Congratulations Shaun White
for winning the gold medal,
America's 100th gold medal
- Woo hoo!
- Shaun White just earned,
his third snowboarding.
We've got two female snowboarders,
who got gold as well, so congratulations
