- I just asked Calvin a question
and he answered in the
cutest way possible.
Calvin?
What kind of bath do you wanna take?
- Bubble.
- A bubble bath?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- And with the vroom, vroom, vroom.
-  I'm not taking a bath.
-  With the motorcycle?
- Yeah.
- (laughs) He always
says vroom, vroom, vroom.
- I'm not taking bath.
- You don't wanna take a bath?
- No.
- I guess we'll be the stinky ones today.
- Silly.
-  (laughs) Silly.
- Yeah.
- You're funny.
- Yeah.
- It's funny when kids start talking more.
- Boop, boop, boop.
(Calvin screams)
-  Aw, he doesn't want
you jumping on his belly.
Gotta be soft.
I would not want him to jump on yours.
- No.
(kissing sounds)
-  Downstairs.
- Yep.
And all the
jars.
- Jars?
Okay.
I was in the middle of getting ready
and Jackson runs upstairs and says,
"Mom, I'm gonna play Candy Land".
And I said, "Do you want
me to play with you?".
And he goes, "I love you".
That makes me feel
good. Where is the game?
- It's in there.
- Oh. It's in the locked cabinets.
- See, it's right there.
- Yup, okay.
So whoever wins gets
to eat candy for lunch.
Is that the deal? (laughs)
I'm the best.
I eat candy whenever the heck I want.
- Because, I'm gonna be the blue.
- Oh, the blue?
- Yeah.
- Can I be the green?
- Yeah.
- Calvin just wants to play with trucks.
- Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna open it.
- Okay, Calvin and I'll
be a player together.
- I'm gonna stop on the broken X's.
- Okay, you go here.
- Okay.
- And it says the youngest picks first.
So start right here.
And, Calvin and I will be a team.
So, you start here and you pick one card.
Pick one card and tell me what it says.
What's it say?
- Stand on an orange card.
- Okay, so two of 'em.
So count two oranges.
One orange.
Two orange.
So you put your guy right there.
Holy cow, Jackson gets to
jump through half the game.
What!
Half the guys are lost
and Calvin has my guy,
so I have a piece of paper.
- Hey mom, I'm going around, around.
- I know, I need to get a good card.
- And around and around,
and I went right here.
- But maybe I'll win.
Maybe I'll catch up.
- No, I'm going to win.
- (laughs) You're gonna win.
One, one yellow.
(Calvin grunts)
Okay, your turn (laughs).
One red.
Jackson is getting all of the good ones.
There we go.
This could be the final
card for Mr. Jackson.
What does it say?
Ah, you have to go back!
(Mom gasps)
- And I win!
(Mom laughs)
- We'll call that the game.
- Yes!
- Good job! (laughs)
- I wanna play it again.
- You wanna film?
- Yes.
- Okay.
I wanted to give you guys
another update on my hair.
I've been telling you that
I've been trying to keep it
pretty healthy, I've just cut it.
And I really do like to have it blonde.
I haven't used this in forever,
especially since the last
time I really went blonde.
Hey, you're moving around mister!
(Jackson groans)
But it's the Oplex number three, so I'm--
Is the red button on?
-  Yup.
- I recently cut it, I've
been trying to keep it blonde.
I've already told you that, but usually
with my hair, I like to do treatments
to make it hydrated.
So usually before I shower,
Usually before I shower,
I will put conditioner on the ends--
but I got this Oplex number three
that you put on your
hair before you wash it.
It's supposed to bond your hair
and strengthen your hair between,
between you coloring it.
I just did it for the
first time in a long time.
My hair feels really good.
Jackson really wanted to film that.
Hopefully I didn't stumble over
words and you could see me.
Are you becoming a cameraman?
- Yeah.
- He really wanted to film.
Anyway, I really want to give
you guys updates on my hair
because I think it's important
when you do color it so much,
or even with winter coming,
like Julie, my sister,
has a lot of static in her hair.
This really has helped my hair a lot.
I've had this for months,
and I only use it once in a while,
but I really should use it more often.
Jackson, why do you like filming?
-  Because I do.
- Cause you see mommy and daddy do it?
And you think it's fun?
(Jackson groans)
Huh?
-  Yeah.
- I think it's cute that you wanna film.
Maybe when you start
playing with toys more,
you can film what stuff
you like to play with.
Jackson doesn't really
play with a ton of toys.
He likes to do games.
Like our little colored
game, our block game.
Or like the Candy Land.
He likes to play with games,
not really just one-on-one toys.
(Jackson mumbles)
-  Or video games.
Playing Mario Kart, or dragon Mario kart.
- Or video games he says.
(laughs)
That's hilarious.
No, go put them back.
-  No.
-  Calvin.
Calvin!
(laughs)
Come pick 'em up, put 'em back.
That was a good listener.
That was a good listener.
I really think he was like,
I was gonna lose them.
Thank you!
(laughs)
When I get ready, the kids just play
in the clothes and grab our shoes.
He was a good listener.
I really thought he was leaving.
He really heard my voice yell at him,
so that's why he came back.
He's just scared of me cause I yell a lot.
-  Calvin has barricaded himself.
During lunch.
Take a bite (laughs).
- He always likes to eat.
-  I know, he just
did it earlier, didn't he?
- Look at this eyes.
-  I think he just likes playing.
- Look, he barricaded him in.
(Dad laughs)
Here Cal.
-  He's pulled these bar
stools up next to himself.
That is so funny.
Look, now he's peeking around.
Hey, I see you!
-  Here ya go, Cal.
- I see you.
- Here's a cookie.
- Take a cookie.
Yum.
(both laugh)
- Okay, I'm ready to take another bite.
- What?
- I'm ready to take another bite.
- I feel like Dad may have
coached you into saying that.
-  Do you like it, Jackson?
I didn't make him say that.
- Nuh-uh?
- Yeah, I said "hey
Jackson, did you like it?"
And what'd you say?
- Yes.
- And I said, "do you wanna
go take another bite?"
And what'd you say?
- Yes.
-  Here ya go.
-  Good boy!
- We're not really doing much
sit down right now.
We're kinda running and just
eat food, we're ready to go.
It worked!
You're eating it!
(chuckles) You sit there and eat that.
That is just quinoa.
I made quinoa, and I
left a little extra plain
just in case.
And it has quinoa, meat, and onions,
and southwest seasoning.
And then I just put in bell peppers
and I'm cooking that right now.
- Getting kids to eat new, different foods
is one of life's great
challenges as parents.
We're still working on it.
- Like you saw earlier,
if I just yell a lot,
(Dad laughs) then they'll do it.
- No, really what it is, it's just like
the key is, if you can just
try it, that's the thing.
If you just try it, and if they actually
eat it and swallow it and everything,
then they're like, oh
this is actually good,
I'm just trying something new.
That's exactly what just
happened with Jackson.
He was very, very hesitant to try it.
Once he actually got a
piece that he bit through
and was chewing on it and everything,
he's like, oh sorry
about that Mom and Dad,
I actually do like this and I
would like some more please.
- Seriously though.
It's hard to do at Calvin's
age, sometimes it's like,
-  I want a cupcake!
-  Now you want a cupcake?
- No, I want cookie.
- Oh, a cookie?
- But I did tell him that.
Usually I try not to
bribe too much like that,
like you can have a cookie after.
We do that sometimes,
especially for dinner.
Honestly, usually me
or Jared will just say,
Mom worked really hard,
you have to have one bite.
-  Yeah.
- I worked hard, you need to eat one bite.
-  Mm-hm.
- I want ginger cookie.
- Okay, well you'll have to
wait until I'm done eating,
and then we'll get you one.
-  Three hours later.
- You're getting into that time of year
where it is not that late at night,
and it gets so dark outside, it's so dark.
We went on a Sunday drive.
We haven't done that very much.
We always did that growing up.
But today, we put the kids in the car
and just like drove around.
It was really fun just
to look at the mountains,
look at the colors of the fall changing.
- I always like to admire
the beauty of our backyard.
We call it our backyard,
but we're just talking
about where we live.
-  The area, yeah.
- The area in which we live.
I'm still editing this
video, it's a long story.
It was just nice to get out
and appreciate the beauty of the world.
- Doesn't seem like you're very grateful.
(laughs)
That's better.
- Show me your gratitude face.
Yay!
Show me your angry face.
Show me your sad face.
Show me your happy face.
Show me your 'I love Jared' face.
(laughs)
That was provocative.
- That's my 'I love you'.
- Aww.
Show me your--
- Poop face.
- Show me your 'it's late
on a Sunday night' face.
- I told Jared I had a headache today.
He goes, "You always have a headache."
(Jared laughs) I'm like, well,
I'm tired.
- I was just gonna say
that's what's called
being a mom of two kids.
(both laugh)
Here's the face that I want you to do.
I want to do the face that goes
with the Lego picture behind there.
So I'll hold the camera up,
and you make a face.
Pretend to be in that picture too.
- â™«  Everything is awesome.
- Jared?
- Not my face exactly.
- Where's Calvin? I can't see Calvin.
- That's Jackson and that's Calvin.
When you're that close,
it's kinda hard to see.
In the camera, it looks perfect.
- Calvin's like.
- (laughs) Aww.
That's so fun to have that.
- I love this.
- I love hanging it on the wall.
- I can't believe they made that for us.
- It's so cool.
- Lego.
- Thanks, Lego.
(bell ringing sound)
I think I do this far too often,
but it just makes me so
grateful that we do this.
I'm done editing our
drone video of the house.
I can't help but have tears
just come down my face because
of how grateful I am for this experience.
Just watching the footage
back and just seeing.
Even just two years ago
when we got the lot.
Where we were and where we are now.
I am just so grateful for everything.
It makes me so happy to make these videos,
to have these videos to look back on.
Watching everything come to fruition,
our dreams come true.
That's what we're doing right now,
and it's so amazing and I am so grateful.
If you guys haven't seen the video,
I'll have a link down
below and in the I card.
Make sure you check this out
because it's very cool to see
the drone perspective
of the house being built
and then go through
these memories together.
A lot of you guys have joined us
on this journey as we've done it
and it's just fun to look back.
Oh my gosh.
My emotions are just
being pulled right now.
I am just so happy right now.
Ellie and I have been in
this house for one year.
Next month will be our anniversary,
which also means that we have had this lot
for two years.
What Ellie and I wanted to do
is we wanted to do a Q&A about the house.
The building process, the house itself.
Any questions related to the house.
We're gonna take the questions now,
but put it up later so that gives
a lot of time for you guys
to think of questions.
Leave them in the comments down below.
Tweet me or Ellie,
or Instagram message us,
and we will answer your questions
in a video coming up very soon.
But for now, it's 2:30 in the morning.
I've gotta get some sleep
before I edit tomorrow's vlog.
(laughs)
Thank you for watching.
Have a wonderful day.
We'll see you guys next time, bye.
