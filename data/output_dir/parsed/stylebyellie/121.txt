Oh there we go.
Calvin hurry, hurry the floor's lava.

- It's coming up, hurry.
Ah run away!
Oh good job.
(laughs) Good job.
Come on over here Calvin.
Jump.
Woo!
Good morning guys.
Hope you're having an awesome day.
We've got some fun, exciting
things planned for today.
For us, it is the day before Thanksgiving,
which means that we are going to be doing
one of my favorite family
traditions later tonight.
It's so exciting!
And also, today is the
one year anniversary
that we have had Penny
as a part of our family.
So we're going to celebrate!
You ready to celebrate?
(Calvin hums)
-  The floor's lava!
(Jared laughs)
- Are you ready to celebrate?
- Yeah!
- Do you have something to tell me today?
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna tell me?
- Are we gonna go to Grandma's house
and pick up Penny some birthday stuff?
- That's right, that's so funny.
Also, did you dress yourself this morning?
- Yeah.
- You picked out your clothes
and you dressed yourself?
- Yeah.
- That is so cool.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
And your shirt is right side forward.
Good job, high five bud.
Like the thing is that it's
not cool that Jackson dresses,
it is cool that Jackson dresses himself,
don't get me wrong, it is cool.
But it's cool that he picks stuff
that looks decent, it looks great.
I couldn't do that for him.
I would pick something totally different
that looks weird.
But show me your socks.
What socks are you wearing?
Ooh your trampoline socks?
You like those ones, huh?
We need a, we need to wipe your face.
That's one thing we've got to work on.
Oh, you've got a marker there.
(Jared laughs)
Your face.
You're so funny.
Did Daddy dress you today?
Yeah?
Because I wanted you to have elbow pads,
'cause elbow pads are
the coolest thing ever.
- The lava!
It just popped.
-  Oh, the floor's lava?
- Yeah.
- Okay we gotta find a place,
let's go, we gotta find a place to get up,
higher ground, let's move.
Move move move.
- Oh I know a higher ground.
-  Okay.
Hup hup, come on Calvin.
Oh good, I think we're safe now.
Thank goodness.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Ooph.
- We finished getting ready.
The boys here are done.
You guys look fantastic.
And we are on our way to PetSmart.
We're gonna grab a couple things.
- We're going to see the fishies!
- Yeah we're gonna see the fishies
and we're gonna grab
some things for Penny.
What do you think Penny needs?
- We made it, Dad!
-  Dad, we made it!
- We made it.
What do you think Penny needs Jackson?
- Birthday stuff.
- Birthday stuff.
I hope they have some things,
because we want to make
this big for Penny.
It's her first year anniversary with us.
Oh my goodness boys,
I think we hit the Jackpot.
What do you see?
- Birthday cakes.
- Yeah, look at all of this stuff.
- I wanna get this one, this yummy one.
-  That looks so cool.
- Look at the donut one.
-  I think Penny
would love this stuff,
birthday boy,
happy birthday.
- It says happy birthday to you.
-  That's right.
What does yours say?
- A dog dog.
- A dog, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday to you.
- Well I think we should
grab one of these.
And maybe we'll get a couple more treats,
and a couple toys, and
we should be all set.
- Let's get Penny a ball.
-  You want to
get Penny a football?
- Yeah.
-  I think we can
find one, let's look.
Look, is this one okay?
- Yeah.
-  Does that one look good?
Look, it even squeaks.
(squeaking)
I'm sure we're gonna regret that later.
(laughing)
Hey, where are you guys going?
You're crazy.
You think this is a getaway or something?
(laughing)
(Jared laughs)
Hey, I'm gonna get you.
Watch out.
Saved ya.
- Why are we meeting up?
- Well Mommy went down to
Grandma and Grandpa's house
to help make Thanksgiving dinner early,
so they could to a photo
shoot for the cookbook.
So Mommy's at Grandma
Griffith's house right now.
As soon as we're done
celebrating Penny's anniversary,
I think that's what we're
calling it, anniversary,
we're gonna go and we're
gonna meet up with them.
And you're gonna play
with all your cousins
with your brand new football.
Does that sound fun?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Here is her little cake.
I have no idea what to expect from this.
Do you think it smells like
dog food or people food?
- Dog food.
- Let's see.
Oh wow.
What do you think it smells like?
- Dog food.
- It smells pretty good though, huh?
Do you want to smell it Calvin?
-  I'm gonna take it
out for Penny.
- Smell it.
- Oh don't eat it, just smell it silly.
(Jared laughs)
Okay.
I've never done this before.
We're gonna slice this up for Penny
and we'll see how this goes.
This might be worse
than one year old kids,
the smash cake, you know the smash cake?
We'll see how it goes.
I've got her stuff set up.
(Jared laughs)
Oh my gosh.
Part of me can't believe I'm doing this,
but I think it's gonna be so much fun.
Should we bring Penny inside?
No no no no no, don't eat it.
That's for Penny.
Should we bring her inside?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's give this a shot.
Cross your fingers, cross your
fingers, cross your fingers.

Jackson wanted to get you a football.
Is that cool?
That's a fun little football.

overboard, I don't know.
We got some fun stuff for her.
Some stuff for inside and for outside.
And some treats.
We're not doing of this at once,
we've got some treats that
she's gonna have later on,

I keep saying birthday,
just 'cause that's what I think of, but,
you are over one year old,
but you have been in our family
- Dad Dad.
Hurt.
- Aww.
- Happy birthday Penny.
- Penny has been our
little furry ball of joy
for exactly one year.
- Last time, last time my birthday was on.
-  Yeah that's right.
So we're so happy you're
in our family Penny.
You bring us so much joy and happiness,
and dog poop,
that I have to pick up.
(Jared laughs)
- She poops outside in the backyard.
- Yes she does.
Do you want to know something Penny?
It was my dream as a
kid to have my own dog.
And I've got that now.
You know, it's fun.
It's cool.
-  I'm gonna
light stuff up their tree.
-  Just because
it's your anniversary,
I'm letting that happen, okay?
You're a good girl.
Penny you love it, I'm
so excited you like it.
(Jared laughs)
Is that fun?
Huh, you like that one?
There's no cotton in that one,
you can't destroy that one too bad.
- Penny, I've got you.
- Good girl.
-  You've got the football?
- Yeah.
- Throw it.
(lively music)
-  Good girl.
-  Whoa (laughs).
- Happy anniversary Penny.
- That's a sweet thing to say.
Ready?
(squeaking)
Oh she's ready.
Go get it.
(lively music)
Are you sayin' hi to Aunt Linda?
(Jared laughs)
-  Shake hands.
-  Did you shake
hands with Aunt Linda?
Yeah?
-  Do you know she's been waiting
to see you all day, Jackson?
-  I know, she's
been waiting for ya bud.
- We're gonna eat rolls,

- Do you love pie?
- Yeah.

and a little bit of pie.
(Jared laughs)
I feel sorry I
- Do miss your babies?
- No, he just woke up.
-  He missed you a lot.
- I'm sorry I missed the party,
but I loved cooking all day with Mom.
-  Yeah.
- Can I have a bowl?
-  Oh you bet I can.
- Hey, have fun and be safe.
Did you hear?
- We'll be safe.
- Oh crap.
(Jackson crying)
- Aww, buddy.
- I didn't
- I didn't now that he was there.
Jackson, you're gonna have so much fun
with your cousins.
- You're cousins aren't going.
-  Your cousins are not going.
-  Do you want
to go play with Cooper?
- The next 15 minutes will be dedicated
to explaining to Jackson.
(Jackson crying)
-  He literally
got over that real quick.
- That was so fast.
I said 15 minutes, more like 15 seconds.
- So the boys are going
on their annual shooting
and the kids, the cousins are playing.
Us girls, I wish I would've filmed,
but then part of me is
like oh, I don't know when.
We were in the kitchen
for like nine hours today,
making Thanksgiving dinner.
We're pooped.
- Uhhh.
- You're gonna go upload a video,
so we're just gonna wait
around for the boys.
It feels good to sit.
We made pies, we made turkey,
we made stuffing, we made cranberry sauce,
everything Thanksgiving dinner.
We took tons of pictures,
and then tomorrow we're
actually gonna have leftovers.
It's like the smartest idea ever.
I think the kids are very happy
that they're able to stay up very late
and just play with cousins.
Handful of cousins over there,
I just beat Julie with foosball.
(laughing)
Woo hoo!
- It had been so long
since we played that game,
you did awesome.
- Yeah.
Calvin, what are you playing with?
- Truck.
-  The truck?
(Calvin growls)
Oh that's scary.
Oh ouchie, oh ouch it hurt.
- Ow?
- Oh that's better.
(Calvin growling)
(Ellie growls)
-  Yay!
-  Jackson did you score one?
-  Yeah.
-  What?
- I'm proud of you.
- Of what?
- Let me tell you that I love you
because you're Ellie's little boy.
(Ellie laughs)
(gentle music)
Yes.
They found my stash of nickels.
(Ellie laughs)
-  Hey.
-  I wondered what that noise was.
-  Calvin knew
exactly what the noise was.
-  Yeah!
-  Putting all the coins in a jar?
- Yeah.
-  That's funny.
- This one's a hard one.
-  That does look hard.
Calvin, do you want to
bring that upstairs?
Let's go upstairs okay.
Come here, goodnight.
- Hi.
- All the cousins are going to bed,
and Jared's getting home
from shooting with the boys
and we're actually gonna drive home
to sleep in our own beds tonight.
But, since all the
cousins are going to bed,
we're gonna have some quiet
time upstairs, huh Jacks?
All the couches are gone.
Let's do it right by the fireplace.
Come here Calvin, Calvin.
All the couches are in the garage.
Let's play with our games right here
until Daddy gets home.
- Okay.
-  Hey Jackson.
- Be super quiet.
-  Okay.
- Shh.
- I'll read to you, this is the first.
-  Here Calvin, this is yours.
- Yeah.
Thanks Mommy.
Mine.
-  Okay, Jackson
can I tell you something?
Look at Mama.
Can you see my face?
I'm proud of you.
