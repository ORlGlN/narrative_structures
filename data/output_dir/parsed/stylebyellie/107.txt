- You ready?
(gentle music)
- I'm ready.
I'm nervous.
- Oh my goodness.
- I'm nervous.
- Let's get comfy.
- Get comfortable.
- Where's our hot chocolate?
- We might be here for awhile.
Can you believe one year ago--
- It's been a year.
- We sat on this couch.
Like I'm already gettin' emotional.
We've been crying.
- We've already cried.
- We said a prayer.
(laughs)
We're like we want to
do this really smooth.
- We sat on this couch one year ago
and we said that we wanted to
change someone's life and--
- Little did we know,
seven other people would donate
an IVF grant alongside ours.
And have seven people have the opportunity
to have a grant.
- Our lives were changed,
their lives were changed.
- We've met some awesome
friends this year through it.
- It's been an incredible year.
And we are so grateful
for that opportunity.
The blessing that we had to be a part,
just a small part of that, you know?
And what has come from
it has been amazing.
Speaking of our families,
our IVF family, oh it's--
- It's been an awesome year.
We talk to them probably every day.
We have our own little chat with them.
And we contribute to our feelings,
they contribute their feelings,
what they're going through.
- All of these ups and downs
that we've been experiencing together
throughout the past year,
we've been sharing with each other.
- And our relationships
have grown even more,
the last few months,
because a lot of them have started
their IVF process.
From last year, there is one baby
that has been born.
There is two on the way
and our other friends,
the other IVF winners,
they are in the middle of
their process right now.
So we are wishing them
lots of love right now.
- We are thinking about them
and we are praying for
them every single day.
Which brings us to this year.
2017 is a new year,
and Ellie and I have talked and thought
this whole year--
- From January 1st, we talked
about, we did this last year,
and Jared and I had told ourselves
from the very beginning,
we never thought anything was gonna come
of sharing our story.
Our whole life has completely changed.
We have two babies,
we've had two miscarriages this year,
and we have one baby on the way,
and our whole life and
family dynamic has changed
since we just got out of college,
just started YouTube and now here we are.
And we always wanted to do a giveaway
during the holidays,
whether it was giving to the food shelter,
donating toys, we've always wanted to try
and give back the most that we could.
And last year, it was a
really cool opportunity
that we were gonna do that,
and we thought, let's try it again
and from January 1st we've
been talking about this grant.
We've been thinking,
we've been trying to figure
out how we can make it work,
we've been saving
and we've told ourselves,
we vowed together, like
if we're in this position
to do this again, we will
and if we're in the position next year
to do it again, we will.
- Ellie and I sat down
and we watched the video
where we made the first announcement
of this whole IVF process.
And it came down to the
reason why we wanted
to do this is because over the years,
we have been given so much,
from family, from friends,
from our community
and we wanted to give back.
And this was the most fitting way
- That we felt--
- that we felt that was
close to doing just that.
So with that, Ellie and I
are very happy to announce
that we will be funding
another IVF grant this year.
(laughing)
It's just so cool
that we're in this position
and we don't know how
long this is gonna last.
But while we're here, we want to do this.
But not only that,
we have three other grants this year
that are already funded
by some very generous
and amazing people.
Zack from JerryRigEverything,
the University of Utah
and the Utah Fertility
Center have all donated funds
for three more IVF grants.
So instead of just ours this year,
there is going to be four,
four, that's I'm very--
- Incredible
- Thank you to those that have been
so kind to donate again.
- Yes thank you very much.
Also a huge thanks to
Footstepsforfertility.org,
for being the foundation
that is making this possible.
For being the non-profit that has already
done so many grants themselves,
but they helped us out last year
and are helping us out again this year.
Now if you're ready to
just jump into this,
we'll have a link in the
description down below,
where you'll find out
all of the information
you need to know,
all of the rules for this giveaway,
how to submit, what to do.
It's in the description down below.
The past year and the
last time we did this,
we learned a lot.
It was an incredible process,
it was a scary process,
but overall, it was amazing.
- It was wonderful,
like the people that we've
met and their progress
has been a huge blessing in our life
and it's been just the
cherry on top to share that.
And we did learn a lot from last year,
especially our first time
doing something so big.
- So big.
- We've learned things that
would go smoother this year.
- So most everything is
going to stay the same,
but there are a few changes this year.
To start off, we want to hear your story.
Just like last year, we
want to hear your story.
We want you to send us
a video to the email
ellieandjaredcontest@gmail.com
and send it through wetransfer.com.
You film your video, you
upload it to WeTransfer
and you send it to
ellieandjaredcontest.com
and we will receive that video.
The giveaway starts right now
and we will take
applications and submissions
until the 16th at midnight,
mountain standard time.
We will take the next week
to review all of the videos,
all of the applications ourselves,
and we will announce
the winners on the 22nd.
We know that infertility is
not a location based issue.
It is a worldwide thing,
but just like last year,
due to legal reasons,
we are only able to have this happen
within the United States.
Most national grants have a
$100 dollar application fee,
and this year, we have an
application fee of $20 dollars.
Now it's very important
to know that this does not
go towards us, we do not
get this money at all,
it goes directly to the foundation
for the processing and
handling of the applications.
- This year we have
decided that the best way
to go about this, to protect and respect
everybody's personal
and emotional stories,
and to make the process go
smoother for you and for us,
is we will not be sharing
the full two minute video
that you submit on our channel.
We know by doing it this way,
the process for us and for you
guys will go a lot smoother.
Last year, Jared, I and his parents
spent hours going over these videos.
We had a worksheet for each
one of the applications
that we filled out.
That way it was the most fair way
to choose a winner.
- Another thing we've learned
is that some clinics don't do
all of the process in-house.
Sometimes you have to do
procedures outside with medicine
and other things, so depending on a clinic
that you go to, there's a chance
that the IVF grant will not cover
that specific process,
but the main IVF process
will be covered by the grant.
So to summarize everything
that we have announced
in this video, we are going to be funding
an IVF grant.
We have three other amazing people
who are donating grants as well.
Applications and submissions are open
starting right now.
They will end at midnight on the 16th,
mountain standard time, and
we will announce the winners
on the 22nd on our normal vlog.
Check the link in the
description down below
to find out information on how to apply,
what to do for the application,
how to submit a video
and so much more.
We want to give a big thanks
to Footsteps for Fertility
for helping out, making this happen,
to Zack from JerryRigEverything,
to the University of Utah,
and to the Utah Fertility Center.
- This has been a wonderful opportunity.
Jared and I have done awesome giveaways
and you know sponsorships
and we've already told
you, but we definitely want
to let you know this is coming
from Jared and I's heart.
This is coming from us.
No one else is getting paid,
we are not getting paid,
Footsteps for Fertility is
a non-profit organization
that is helping receive the applications
from you guys, and they're
awesome friends of ours.
This is just something that
we want to do to give back.
And this last year has
been the biggest blessing
meeting all seven of our awesome friends,
our awesome IVF winners.
And I've loved staying
in contact with them,
and I hope that this year is the same way.
We hope you guys felt the love
that we are trying to give out.
We hope that you guys have
an awesome holiday season.
We can't wait until we get
your guys' videos to watch.
We spent hours last year watching
and we're just excited
and we hope you are too.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
- That is going to be
our video for the day.
We hope you have a wonderful day
and we will see you guys next time.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.
- Bye.
