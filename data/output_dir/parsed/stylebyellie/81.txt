- Well good golly, it's only nine o'clock
in the morning and our plans
have changed 800 times.
Let's go to St. George and have a party.
Our friends are sick,
um, let's got to Deer Valley.
Everything's too expensive to rent.
Let's just stay home.
That's boring, let's
go back to St. George.
So we found an awesome place in St. George
that we are going to.
The kids were so sad this morning
when we're like, we're not going
and now they're very
excited that we're going.
Are you ready for an adventure?
We are, and it's not even
nine o'clock yet baby.
Woo!
We are good.
What was your suggestion?
- What about the baby name Britith?
- Britith?
Mmm, I'm gonna write that one down okay?
-  What was the
other name you suggested?
- Gary.
-  Gary?
That's a good name.
- Gary or Britith, I will
write that on the list.
We've been having a little
Marco Polo war with Bonnie,
wondering they are on the road,
because we left before her,
just by a few minutes--
-  We had to make a stop.
- We had to make a stop, where is she?
- They're a little bit
behind us, when we--
-  So we're ahead.
- Yeah, we're ahead.
We thought we were behind this whole time.
Listen, we forgot the walkie-talkies,
so I figured this could
be a good alternative,
what do you say there, Ellie Belly?
- Where are you?
You ignored my call.
- Wait, I did not ignore your call.
I answered it and I said
hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, and nobody answered.
We are passing exit 281.
- Okay, we are passing 281 right now.
Which lane are you in?
We're trying to catch up to you.
- Good luck.
- I don't have any money,
but what I do have is a
particular set of skills.
I will find you and I will follow you.
- Good luck.
- We've been having a little,
what did you call it?
- Marco Polo.
-  And there is Joel
flying through the lanes.
He always has to show us up, that jerk.
-  Everyone is going really slow--
-  Look at him.
-  And he's going the speed limit.
So don't worry guys, he's not speeding,
everyone else is just going really slow.
-  Yes he is, he just flew past us.
-  Ellie, I'm
trying to save his neck.
-  He didn't even wait.
That's it.
- Now we're playing catch up.
Anyone got some ketchup
for this hamburger?
(Terry Crews speaking)
-  Listening to this podcast.
- These are two of my favorite people,
Tim Ferriss and Terry Crews.
And I've followed Terry Crews
for the past four or five years,
just his life and
looking behind the scenes
and where he's come from
and where he is now.
Probably one of the most
genuine human beings
that I have ever learned about.
I don't know him personally,
but if I could ever meet
him and pick his brain,
he's one of the people
that I want to meet,
the most out of anyone.
- I have really enjoyed
listening to this podcast.
The kids were not very happy,
when we were like, okay
movie off, listen time.
- Let me finish the whole movie okay?
- Calvin did fall asleep.
He actually likes his blanket now guys.
He likes his Christmas blanket.
- He asked for it before
we even got in the car,
he asked for his new blanket.
- Yeah, I had his old
one because that's one
he's been liking, but he's like no.
Anyway, but this has been
a really good podcast,
very inspirational, very uplifting,
it's really fun to listen to other people
and their successes.
- I love learning from
other people, you know?
-  Totally.
- I love learning from other people.
- And we kind of stopped
our little competition,
because Joel always has to win.
Joely.
- Joel just likes being in front.
- Yeah, so fine, Joel you win.
We'll follow you, rather
than you follow us.
- Actually the reason
why I want to be behind,
is so I can do adaptive cruise control
and just kind of--
- That is nice.
(laughing)
He's out too, my handsome little guy.
I love that he came up with names today.
And I was like, Jackson,
you're so full of adventure,
because he's like where
are we, where are we?
And I'm like we're in Salt Lake,
how did we get there?
I'm like we drove there.
(laughs)
And I was like you're
so full of adventure,
and he goes no I'm full of food.
And I'm like oh my gosh.
He makes me laugh.
I love him.
Okay, back onto the podcast.
- Friends don't let friends drive slow.
- Jared didn't approve
Joel's illegal lane change
over the double line,
so we'll keep up, but
you have to keep the law.
(bright music)
- Oh my goodness, we got here
and the kids are already
going crazy exploring
and Joel, where did you get that cookie?
- They left it for us.
- What the heck?
(children yelling)
They've got fresh cookies for us?
Oh my goodness, well guys,
welcome to our New Year's home.
What?
(children yelling)
Is that your bed Jackson?
- Yeah, this is my bed.
-  Oh my goodness.
This is your bed?
- Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness gracious.
Oh look at that, there's stairs up to it.
-  And here's a ladder.
-  That's your bed Lincoln?
- Here's a ladder!
-  And a ladder?
Oh my gosh.
-  Look at my balcony!
- This is like better than Christmas.
- Yeah.
- Here's a laundry room!
-  There's a laundry room?
- Yeah!
- Oh I can't even believe it.
-  Jackson isn't it crazy?
- Yeah.
-  There's no snow
and it's warm enough outside.
- Yeah, I feel just, it's crazy here.
- I want to go swimming.
- Only six hours away, it is snow and cold
and in the 20s and 30s,
but here, it feels good.
Six hours, still in Utah.
- Do you have to walk to the pool?
- Yeah, if we go there, we have to walk.
-  And it's not that far actually.
-  We're gonna help Dad bring in
all of our suitcases.
Do you want to help him
- Yeah.
- bring in your suitcase?
- You want your suitcase?
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Do we have to walk to the pool?
- No we're just gonna take it to your room
and then maybe, we'll
get to the pool later.
-  Ready?
For a little party hardy,
- Ready Freddy.
-  with our cousins.
- I can put my stuff in the house?
-  Uh-huh, go
put it by your bunkbed.
And I'll put Calvin's by--
- But I can't carry my suitcase.
-  I can help.
- After we became
acquainted with the house,
the most important thing that we had to do
was set up Cody's little Nintendo
and we're all playing Mario,
like everyone is getting into this.
Your turn.
- Um Jackson has now learned how to jump.
So let's see how far you go this time,
remember to jump.
-  Good, are you Luigi?
- Yeah.
-  Are you being
the little brother today?
Yeah Jackson!
- Drove five hours to play Nintendo.
(Jared laughs)
- It's different down south.
- It is different, it's a little warmer.
-  Look Jared,
look how far he's getting.
-  Jackson you're killing it.
Good job, whoa!
- Woo!
-  Awww!
- He got it.
- That's my boy.
Gettin' on with Nintendo.
Good job son!
-  Jackson broke
out the Connect 4 game.
Perfect game for you two.
Uh-oh.
- No, Jackson, you have to stack right.
-  No, no, he
doesn't have to do that.
How it works is he puts
them wherever he wants.
Let's start over.
He puts them wherever he wants,
and you put yours wherever you want,
and you try and get four in a row, huh.
- I'm going to win.
-  Make sure and give him his turn.
-  Jackson, no you're not.
-  Jackson won.
- I win.
I win.
- Remember how I said while
I was climbing the mountains
of Utah, how the sunset was just gorgeous,
well the same is true
down here in St. George.
There's a lot of more
buildings covering the view,
yeah, it doesn't do it justice,
but the sky is just like red past there.
It looks so beautiful.
One thing that we've been
talking about all day
and looking at all day
is Ellie's little belly.
I shouldn't even say little,
because look at the thing
bounce, like holy cow.
It's poppin'!
- This outfit is not
like the most flattering,
but like I haven't even eaten a full meal
in a long time and it's
totally sticking out.
-  Ellie look at your belly.
-  That's cute.
- Wait, you know what?
I think I know what's
in Ellie's belly, oh.
(laughing)
- I bet you weren't the
first to say that ah.
Ellie belly, isn't that
cute, look at this.
-  Yeah, he is
growing so much Ellie.
- Can you believe it's a boy?
- No.
- How's little Joel doing?
(laughing)
- So we talked about baby names
the whole way down,
the whole way down.
- Oh I bet.
- And guess what name kept coming back up?
-  Joel?
-  Joel is a good name.
It kept coming up.
- That would be amazing.
- Yeah.
- I prefer Hoel.
- Hoel?
We definitely that--
-  Favorites.
- A few favorites, yeah.
We have a few that keep coming back up,
one you already know about.
But we had one today that we were like,
yeah, I like that a lot so.
- George, St. George?
- Joel, don't give it away.
(garbled) You know what I'm saying?
- George?
- Alfonzo.
- Alfonzo.
- Yeah.
-  The Fonz.
-  What, why are you guys laughing?
- Okay, I want to tell
them one of the names.
- Get out of here, because
she's gonna tell me.
- Okay okay bye, you can't
be here right now, bye.
-  Be honest
whether you like it or not.
- Wait, don't say anything
we're still recording!
- Tell Daddy what you just did.
-  What did you do bud?
- I pooped.
-  You went poo in the toilet?
-  Good job.
We're proud of you.
-  That's my boy.
- Pizza delivery is here.
- Your belly!
-  Isn't that crazy?
(groovy upbeat music)
- This is monumental stuff
happening right here guys.
Okay, so we're sitting
with Aspyn and Parker,
Bonnie and Joel and Ellie.
We just finished playing games.
We're now FaceTiming Cullen and Katie.
While all of this is happening,
I get a notification on my watch
that Terry Crews liked my tweet.
The Terry Crews.
It's so blurry, I need someone
to tap on it for me.
- There you go.
- Thanks Aspyn.
- Oh no!
- Oh no!
-  Terry Crews liked my tweet.
- Jared that's cool.
- That's really cool.
-  Do you think he'd
flex his pecs for you?
- I think that's how he liked it.
He was just just like poof.
- He did it with his pecs.
- And that's how he did it on the phone.
- Do you think he clicked on your profile?
- He may, he probably follows
our YouTube channel now.
- Does he subscribe to the vlog?
(laughing)
- Thanks Terry, appreciate it.
Hey Cullen.
- Oh my gosh he did like it.
- Yeah, I'm not making this up,
this is not fake news.
This is real life.
-  He quote-tweeted it.
- Get out, what did he say?
What did he say?
-  He said wow, thank you Jared.
- Ohhhh!
- That was so cool.
- That was awesome.
All of this is happening right now.
Sorry guys.
Okay, I gotta get back to my friends.
Thanks Terry, appreciate you.
What in the world?
- He looks sleepy.
- Come here, buddy
- He started walking back real scared.
- What was he doing?
- Aww.
-  Hey, do you want
to come sit next to me?
He's like so out of it.
I have gone up there three times now
trying to get him back to bed.
-  Awww.
-  Hey buddy.
He just wants him Mom.
That's all he wants.
- What did he say to you?
- He was just like, I want my mommy.
He seriously kept backing up like.
-  His hair is out of this world.
-  He's so blond.
I can't figure out who I
think he looks like more.
I think he looks like you Ellie.
- I think he looks more like Ellie
and I think Jackson looks more like me.
- What's weird is if
you see a picture of me
when I was little--
-  It looks just like Jackson.
- Yeah, like the sharp
teeth and dark eyes.
- No I think he looks more like me.
- Okay.
I kinda want him to do
it, so I'm gonna say that.
- Well either way, Jared
and I look very similar.
- Some people, this is embarrassing,
they're like are you
guys brother and sister?
And I'm like no.
- We get that too every once in awhile.
-  Do you guys?
- Honestly, it makes you feel so creepy.
- I think couples, when
they've been together
for awhile, they start
to look alike.
- To look like each other.
- Totally, the same thing with like pets.
Yeah.
Like on 101 Dalmatians, how the pets
and the owners are walking
and they look so similar, totally fact.
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's real.
- Tonight was so fun,
but before we go to bed,
I thought we'd, I showed the upstairs,
I didn't think we showed
the downstairs very much.
This place is really really wonderful.
We've got the kitchen all down here,
kind of like the dining room table
and the living room and that door goes
to the backyard.
And then this is where
Bonnie and Joel are sleeping
and in here, I've got to show you this,
because I don't know, I think we may have
to kick out (laughs)
Joel close the door dude.
-  You're in my bathroom.
- I am in your bathroom,
but I'm doing a house tour.
We might have to kick Bonnie and Joel out
one of these nights,
so we can use the bath tub.
It looks awesome.
We go out through here,
this is like a huge closet,
and then we're in the laundry room
and then there's another bathroom.
So this is like a duplex,
and it's really cool.
I don't know if they call it a duplex
or a condo.
Anyway, it's really cool.
I'm really happy to be here.
We had some plans change.
We were planning on hanging out
at Carl and Jinger's house,
but they got a little sick,
so slight change of plans,
we're gonna still see if we can see them
for New Year's and everything,
but it's going to be a
great New Year's this week.
And that is where we're
going to end the vlog.
