this is calvess go to Dan Smith and we
are busting up laughing go what are you
so excited about Ellie laughing in
society whether this is not a pregnancy
test not a pregnancy test this is an
ovulation test yes and it's positive it
is hi so this one tells you the high end
entity oh really that's awesome kid this
is huge well that's a good morning
welcome to Disneyland for any of you
that are new you may think it's kind of
weird I am sharing ovulation test but
here on YouTube a lot of people share a
lot of things three years ago on this
day I ovulate 'add that's crazy
we went we had a doctor's appointment at
the fertility center we went home we
were supposed to go back and do the
injections and when I went back on my
birthday which is tomorrow the eggs had
already released and they were like oh
no we were like what it was like the
worst start of my birthday ever
we ended up getting pregnant with
Jackson on Samara so the Samara had
helped me ovulate this time around
though we surprisingly had at Calvin I
had no periods and then it was like nine
months in Austin I got pregnant Elvis it
was just like a miracle we had no idea
you know Calvin is almost - he'll be -
next month so by the time we have a baby
hopefully he'll be coming up on three
nearly three and so I've been taking
ovulation tests I had a period so
usually about every two months it seems
like I've had a period which is really
good for me because I have been very
regular after Kent Jackson I'd only had
one period and then none
and then after Calvin I've actually been
more regular than I
per have which is every two or three
months is all has a period and so I had
a period and I've been taking ovulation
test then I just finished up my last
pack so before we came I bought this
different one and so instead of saying
low and high it'll say low high and then
your peak and I took my last test
yesterday of the old and then today is
this new kind and it says peak so
yesterday may have been the actual high
and I so there it is I am excited I'm
shocked
I am hopeful and excited are you
clapping Jackson he makes two you guys
we are under operation catch the eighth
the operation catch the egg mission this
is a bad mission that we're all right
