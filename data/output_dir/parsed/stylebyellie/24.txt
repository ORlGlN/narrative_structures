- Well that was kind
of a scary experience.
- What did Calvin just do?
What did you say about the doctor?
Did everybody have fun?
I think today's gonna be a great day.
Both the kids went to bed good.
They both slept through the night.
It's eight o'clock and
they're both still asleep.
So I get to enjoy my
breakfast all to myself?
Holy cow.
- It's like, what is life right now?
-  How was your workout?
- I pushed myself really hard.
I'm in between the lines of I feel so good
and I'm gonna throw up.
(Ellie chuckles)
My hip is killing me though.
-  Want some cereal?
- I do.
Can I sit next to you?
- Sure.
Oh, it's gonna be a date.
Come over.
Oh, my goodness, good morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you know you slept so late?
- Yeah.
♪ All through the night ♪
♪ All through the night ♪
-  How's that to warm you up?
-  Is that better?
Does that warm your arms up?
-  He wanted something warm.
- Oh, I need something
warm to warm my arms up.
-  Is that better?
- I made Mickey Mouse.
-  That is so cool
that you could do that.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna learn my letters.
- We are going over
your lower case letters.
Jackson has all of his
alphabet passed off at school,
but now we have to go over his
lower case letters, and pass those off.
Do you think you can pass it off today?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, can you
read me the first line?
- E, S, M, K, T.
- Perfect!
You had a hard time with T this morning,
but I think you got it.
- Yeah.
- So let's try really hard
to pass those off, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Are you excited for school?
- Yeah.
- He asks every day, "Is it a school day?"
- Yeah.
- Nope, but today is!
- Well, that was kind
of a scary experience.
You'll have to speak up, I'm
wearing a towel; don't look!
Okay, guys, I showed you but,
not now, I don't want you to look.
I had a little scary experience,
I got out of the shower
and I noticed Calvin was not
on the bed like Ellie said,
he was watching a show while
she took Jackson to school.
Calvin's not on the bed, that
means he's not in the room
where the door was closed
and locked and all that stuff
so he couldn't get out,
and then I come out
and I'm in my towel running
around looking for him,
and I see this garage door
open, and I'm thinking,
oh, crap, like he is out, he is running.
So, I get out in my towel,
running through the snow,
looking for him without
looking at my phone,
and I'm like, oh crap,
where the heck is Calvin.
I'm running through the
house, after my feet are
just like sopping wet, and freezing cold.
Luckily Ellie has him.
Oh, my gosh.
That was kinda scary.
I'm glad, Ellie just showed
me the video she filmed,
she just texted me,
they're laughing about it.
- All right, is everyone okay?
Calvin, are you okay?
What did Calvin just do?
- Went outside.
- Oh, my goodness.
- I'm freaking out because my kid,
I thought he's lost, but
he's just with Ellie.
Oh, my gosh, that was scary.
Okay, I'm gonna put some clothes on, guys.
Stop looking down there!
Jeez!
- Okay, you guys hold hands.
Momma is gonna be
walking like this, so I'm
still limping, guys, with
my ingrown toenail removal.
I've been wearing my slipper on one foot,
'cause it's the most wide,
comfy shoe for my toe.
So, I have a feeling when
I'm done with these slippers,
I'm gonna want some new house slippers.
I've never been a huge
fan of house slippers,
but this last year, it's been
a night and day difference.
I actually really love it.
You don't wanna eat, Calvin?
Dang it.
So, usually once a week I
like to go out with the kids
for lunch, just me and the
boys, and they really like
Chick-fil-A because they have
a play area, but it's closed.
But they really like Costa Vida 'cause
usually I let them have an orange drink.
- Orange drink is my favorite.
You're getting so big.
- My belly?
- Yeah.
(Ellie laughs)
- Spice!
-  Is it spicy?
- Yeah!
-  Do you like it?
- If it's spicy, you have to have water.
-  Does your puppy
want to have a drink?
- Don't blow it too much.
- Do you want me to tie
it, so you can hold it?
Want it bigger?
- No!
- Do you want it smaller?
Is that good?
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to tie it?
- Yeah.
- You were worried about it popping.
Did you win it at school?
- Yes.
- I gotta tie it.
I won't pop it; I gotta tie
it so the air won't come out.
Is that okay?
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk!
Are you happy with it?
- Yeah.
- How did you win it at school?
Because you were good?
-  Hey, pink dress!
- I'm wearing a pink dress.
- Yeah.
- What did you say about the doctor?
- The doctor really helps you.
- The doctor helps me, huh?
Yeah, we're going to our
chiropractor appointment today,
and Jackson said he's gonna use
the shockers on my back,
'cause usually she does stuff
to my back and sometimes he helps.
- What's this
thing here?
- It helps with the snow.
Will you open the door for me?
Awesome!
Thank you, mister!
So, I'm waiting for my appointment
and the boys are just
sitting here playing.
I love this.
I love our days where I
take Jackson to school,
I pick him up, we go to lunch,
we just run our errands
together, just the two,
and they helped me pick out
some stuff at the store today,
they got Play-doh, and I got
some more pens and pencils.
I love this stage of life.
I really like having two toddlers.
Calvin's talking more,
they're just growing up tons,
and it's just.
- Hey, I want that!
-  And they sometimes fight.
Well, you want the chair,
but he's sitting there.
You sit on the big one.
You want the little chair?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, will you look at me?
Look at Mom.
You sit on the big one and when he's done
then you sit on the little one.
Perfect.
Now we're all sitting
on chairs; this is fun.
But I just, I like this.
I like my little people,
and I like my little baby.
- No, this one hand.
No, two!
- As a kid in school, and in
church, sports, activities,
my favorite thing to do was
learn valuable life lessons.
Skills, and things that
you could learn a few times
and take with you the rest of your life.
And Ellie is doing activity
days in our church,
and she does fun activities
with these girls,
these young women, they learn things.
And today, it's cool.
They're learning how to build
a fire in the winter time,
for like camping and everything.
So, I'm out here, it's
kinda silly, but it's funny.
I'm making it a little easier,
I'm eliminating some of the snow.
I shoveled off all the snow,
and I'm putting ice melt down
so they don't have too hard of a time.
But they're learning the skill,
and that's the important part.
Ellie grew up with her
dad as a scout master,
and they would do, you
know, go to activities,
they would learn things with their dad,
which I am so grateful for,
because Ellie loves this stuff.
She loves to be outdoors, around the fire
with s'mores, all that kind of stuff.
But it's cool to have Ellie
learn that from her dad,
and then teach these young
girls how to do this stuff.
It makes me proud that Ellie is taking on
this role for these young women.
Kinda making it a little easier for them,
but nonetheless, they're
learning a valuable skill
for when you're out in the
wilderness in the wintertime,
how to build a fire in a wet climate.
That's the hardest part, is when all
your stuff is wet, to build a fire.
So, I love you, Ellie, and
I appreciate what you do.
Me, on the other hand, I'm going to learn
a very valuable skill, and that is
how to free fall from an airplane.
Oh!
- All right, we have
our wood, I have my ax,
matches, gloves, and
the stuff for the girls.
I know Jared told you guys
about my little adventure today
with the activity girls at church.
We're gonna learn how to build a fire.
We're gonna learn safety
when building a fire,
and we're gonna enjoy some
hot dogs and marshmallows.
Mom's outta breath.
This is gonna be interesting;
it's a good thing
that I have a helper, because it's like me
and another adult, and then
we're with the girls, so,
it's always fun doing
activity days in church,
church activities with kids, but sometimes
it gets stressful, especially when
you're doing stuff like that.
Fire!
First of all, look at that belly!
I got this shirt from
Athleta, and it's not even
a maternity shirt, but it
was super long and stretchy,
and it's like the most
perfect thing in the world.
Calvin, you okay?
Yeah, just a little tired.
I wanna show you guys, I wanna
give you a baby room update,
and I want some of your guys' opinions.
I don't think you guys
even realize how many times
you guys have helped Jared and I.
And not even just with, like,
room decorations and stuff,
but just questions that
we've had that you guys
have answered has been very helpful,
and we've been very appreciative.
But I know a lot of people are
gonna be excited about this.
So this is the baby room.
And we've never lived in a
house, making a baby room,
so we really can do a
little bit more to it
than we would, maybe, normally do in
the apartments we've been in.
So, the baby room I want
to be a little bit more
woodsy themed, I'm kind of
going off of the blanket
that my mom had made me,
so like little bears,
little woodsy characters,
and then his blanket
I got brown 'cause I just feel like
this already matches him.
It's just something that
I've kind of gone with,
like, how I felt, but, right here,
on this wall, this is a big old wall
that we are going to be doing wallpaper.
And, there's a few options
that I'm gonna show you
a picture of, that me and my
friend have been going over
kind of designing the
room, and the wallpaper
that I am drawn to, is
the more just plain, wood,
tall, trees, like the darker ones.
So, that's the one I'm going towards,
so what do you guys think with that?
And then, we are going
to do longer curtains
that go to the ground,
and then I have some
blackout shades coming,
so I think the curtains
will just be like, kinda gray like that.
So that wall's gonna be really fun,
and then we're gonna put two huge pictures
behind the wallpaper, so it'll
be like a wood wallpaper,
or woodsy wallpaper, and
then two huge pictures
of some characters, like a
brown bear, and another animal.
So, we'll have to look
at the animals and see,
but two big pictures right
there, and they'll be framed,
in wood frames, and then.
You okay?
Is that cozy?
And then on this wall, we are gonna do
two really long shelves;
I really like having
Jackson and Calvin's room
with shelves downstairs,
and having some of their
knickknacks on there.
So, we're gonna put two big
wood shelves right there,
and then right here, we're going to put
that picture frame with
the picture of baby,
and we're gonna have it just right there.
We are going to do a huge rug in here,
and I've been loving rugs, I
feel like it softens the room.
I love having a rug in my
bedroom that has carpet,
and the rug downstairs that has carpet.
I love rugs, even on
carpet, 'cause I feel like
it just kind of softens the room.
So, we're gonna get a huge rug in here,
and then right here we're gonna do
a big wood stump
for my side table.
And I'll just put my
water bottle on there,
and a little bowl with crackers and stuff.
Usually, when I nurse,
that's where I want it.
I think that's gonna be so cute.
George, you'll stay right there, mister,
and usually I just find a little
basket for the kid's room,
to have knickknack and
toys, like the baby's toys
will go in the little basket
that we could put right here.
So a cutesy little basket,
and I think that's about it.
I think that will complete
his room, and then we'll
kind of move on to Jackson
and Calvin's and kinda
spruce it up a little bit for them.
Have you been liking
sharing a room with Jackson?
- Yeah.
- You guys have been, our life has been,
night and day difference, like,
both boys sleep through the night.
They cuddle, they laugh,
they've been doing really good.
And if they didn't do
good, then I would just
separate them, but I wanted to try it out,
because I always loved sharing
a room with my siblings.
Did you just stick your
tongue out to them?
(laughs)
So they've been really enjoying that,
so I'm excited to spruce
that room up, too.
Okay, should we go out?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'm really excited to
get this room together.
I obviously love having a picture of Jesus
in the kids' rooms; I
think that this was such
a sweet picture, I picked that out.
This was picked out
specifically for Calvin,
so I think when baby comes, we'll have
to find a picture for, for baby,
and then this will go into Calvin's room
because this is Calvin's picture.
(upbeat music)
Did everybody have fun?
- Yeah!
- Everyone had fun?
Did you have fun, Calvin?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
We had fun outside,
(children yelling)
Calvin's going, "Choc, hot dog, choc!"
Eating chocolate s'mores
and roasting hot dogs.
I had a blast.
Having nine girls over, trying to learn
how to chop wood and
build a fire is not easy.
I was impressed by them, and we
got it done, and it was so fun.
Thank you guys, so much for watching.
The kids are singing in the tub right now.
I am so excited about the nursery
and all the fun things
that we're gonna be doing.
I can't wait to read your guys' responses
of your opinions of what items to get,
maybe for each spot, so thank you guys,
so much for watching, and
we will see you tomorrow.
Bye.
