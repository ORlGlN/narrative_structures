-  Penny!
Jackson, you have a beard!
Calvin, you have one too.
Arggh matey!
The name's bubble beard.
Arggh, it's bubble beard's wife.
-  Bonnie has a lot of make-up.
I know she has nude lipstick.
I'm going to sneak in her house
and see if I can find one.
Okay, hold on.
-  Alright, push the
button, you can do it.
Good job.
- No, no, no, no.
-  No, no, no, no.
- Nee, ne, ne, ne.
-  No, nee, no, new.
- New, new, nah, nah.
(laughter) (gasp)
-  There's our door.
Can you find the star?
- Star.
-  There it is.
Good job.
Okay, Calvin, your job for the day
is to hold all of the
tickets and don't lose them.
Okay?
That's how we get on the plane.
Can you do that for us?
- He is so tired.
- (laughter) Good job.
Alright.
Kay, I think we'll make it.
I don't think we'll lose the tickets.
We've got a good man on the job.
Clearly knows what he's doing.
 Calvin, did you put
the tickets in your pocket?
He, like really is the
right man for the job.
(laughter)
-  Oh, you did.
Oh you sneaky mom.
I thought you put them in your pocket.
Look.
Look at his stance.
- ♫ ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY AND Z.
♫ Now I know my ABC's.
♫ Next time won't you sing with me!
-  Good job.
That's a great song, bud.
They're making us take out
all electronics that we have,
and putting them in buckets.
So we have a record seven
things on this tray right now
for our family.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
-  Anything to pass
the time in the airport.
(laughter)
- His eyes are like ...
-  He is gonna fall
asleep in like, a minute.
Oh, you're so ... Look it.
He is so tired.
(child babble)
-  Awww, good boy.
(laughter)
Oh, he tricked you.
- I mean if the kid was
doing that to your crotch,
it would hurt so bad.
-  Yeah
- He's doing it to my boobs and it hurts.
Probably not as bad as, you know.
-  Well, I don't know.
- I don't know.
I don't know.
But it's not fun. (laughter)
-  He does ... He thinks it is.
- Alright.
(happy scream)
- Told ya.
- I'm (inaudible) my car down this.
-  Okay.
Nice.
(happy guitar music)
-  Penny!
Hi girl.
How are you? Ohh! (laughter)
Did you miss us so much?
You are so ... (surprised scream)
I love you, Penny.
I love you.
I missed you.
-  Where's your ball?
-  Go get your ball.
Ready?
(laughter)
-  You should
have put it on her head.
(laughter)
Calvin!
You goof ball.
Guys, we're hooooooome!
♫ We are home.
- Popping party.
Popping party.
Guys, we're home.
That was a very short flight.
And we have flown such
longer flights, but for some
reason, I feel like our
day ... it's only 4:30,
but I'm like, hmm, we can
all go to bed. (laughter)
-  Baby brother.
- Baby brothhh.
(laughter)
-  Don't try and
pawn off your sandwich
so you can have (laughter)
- I'm telling you.
You can have a treat after you eat ...
-  You have to eat
the whole thing, buddy.
Not just a bite.
We have been watching Boss Baby a lot.
And like, the kids favorite
part of the entire movie
is one, when the baby's bum
comes out and he's like,
going through the conveyor belt.
Two, baby brotthhherr.
- Baby brothhherrr (laughter)
- It's just so funny to
have that slow motion.
There are some movies that just have these
quotable moments that
just keep you laughing
and laughing forever.
For me, when I was a kid,
it was on a Goofy movie,
me and my sister, Jennifer,
would watch the part,
where the bus driver in
the first song was like ...
♫ I'm gonna sit on my butt.
That made us laugh and we
rewound that so many times.
What are your favorite funny movie quotes?
Let me know in the comments down below.
I'd love to read through 'em
and watch that movie too.
So make sure you have
the quote and the movie
so I can see exactly what it is.
-  Jackson, you have a beard!
How did you grow a beard when
your dad can't even do it?
Calvin, you have one too!
Oh, this gives me a good idea.
Arggh matey, the name's Bubble Beard.
I'm here to take all of your bath bombs.
(sinister laughter)
Make you walk the plank.
Argghhh.
Argghhh.
(whispering) Shhh, just
take this real quick.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
There we go. Arggghhh.
It's Bubble Beard's wife! Wifey Beard.
- (gurgling)
-  She is here to, ah ...
- Eat you!
-  Eat you! Arrgghhh
Avast ye mateys and swab the deck.
(intimidating grunting)
-  You make the best bubble beards.
(laughter)
Ah yes, Mr Wise Long Beard
of the white, enjoying
time being a mystical wizard.
-  Did you hear this?
-  Was that a fart?
(child evil laughter)
-  That was nasty.
You did that on purpose.
(raspberry farting)
Anytime we change Calvin's diaper,
he like, forces a fart out.
It's the most disgusting
thing in the world.
-  And he things it's so funny.
- He thinks it's funny.
But it makes me wonder, I'm like, okay,
he's doing this intentionally.
I wonder if he's like,
ready for potty training.
Or at least to start like,
getting that in his ...
- Absolutely.
-  Yeah.
- I think he'll train pretty good.
-  Yeah, absolutely.
- He loves copying Jackson.
-  Yeah, so this may be a good time,
a good growing experience
for you, young man.
Calvin, give me a thumbs up.
- (raspberry fart)
- Every time Jackson goes
potty, he will go ...
-  And like, pretend.
Yeah.
- And he won't go, but he'll
sit, which is good because
Jackson at first was like, ...
-  I don't want to
sit on the toilet. Yeah.
-  Mr Bum.
(laughter)
-  Mr Bum Baboo! (laughter)
I can't draw that, and you know that.
Stop it!
Jackson, stop it!
- So I already showed you
guys what we're wearing for
family pictures tomorrow, which is this.
And believe it or not, I do
not have any nude lipstick.
I'd like to wear nude
lipstick with that dress.
I have a very bright pink
one, but I need more of like
a subtle nude one and
Bonnie has a lot of make-up.
I know she has nude lipstick.
I'm going to sneak in her house,
and see if I can find one.
Without her knowing.
(whispers) Do you guys want to come?
Shhh. I hear them.
(soft music)
They're in the back yard.
(louder piano music)
Shh.
Okay.
Shoot.
Bonnie's right there.
(suspenseful music)
-  Wait, hold on.
(dishes clanging)
- Holy shizz.
Look at all of her make-up.
(hyperventilating)
(whispering) This is perfect.
This is perfect.
Two orange.
Oh, that's a good nude.
Fox.
Maybe I'll take that.
Too dark.
That's a good one too.
That's called Velvet Teddy.
Oh shoot.
I'm so nervous. That's red.
That'll work. That'll work.
Hellooo. (laughter)
- Oh my god. (laughter)
- Do you care if I have some lipsticks?
- No.
(laughter)
Lipsticks?
- I need some nude lipstick
for pictures tomorrow.
- Did you already go get 'em?
(laughter)
- Lovely lady.
-  I'm surprised your kids are up.
Hi cuties.
-  Believe me.
We took a really late nap today.
-  I know. It
takes me back forever.
(laughter)
- Seriously, let's find you a good nude.
(laughter)
Not this one.
- I know, I was like, "that's red". Ew.
Too red.
-  Um, Bonnie has
a plethora of makeup.
See, I wonder if that will
be too old nudie for me.
That might be too pink.
This is Teddy.
-  Faux.
-  I think Faux might be my guy.
-  I do have one called Teddy.
Oh, Velvet Teddy.
-  Yes, and that's a
good one. I used to have that.
Then I used it up.
Okay, I think one of
these two will be great.
-  Okay.
-  Thank you.
I'm very excited for family pictures.
-  Yay!
- Okay guys, Faux is
underneath, Teddy's ups top.
Think Teddy would look
better with the dress.
Cause the dress is kind of busy.
Teddy is mat and it's brown.
This is more shimmery. Do you think?
-  Deal.
You plug the curling iron in.
You turn it on.
You push "home".
-  That's weird. Home?
-  Yeah.
-  The first time?
- Yeah. Home key.
-  Okay, girl.
Um, Bonnie's letting (laughter)
Bonnie's letting me use her
curing iron tomorrow too.
So she's going .. I'm going
to test it out and see.
It's a new curling iron.
- I have to be nice, because
when I want your stuff
(laughter) I'll be able to take it.
-  You really don't
want me to take your stuff,
but you're going to let me.
-  Yes I do.
- So now it's not on
home because I moved it.
Is that okay?
-  Yeah, it's okay.
It'll kind of move, so put it towards ...
It's really hard to get used to.
- What button do I push to make it go up?
-  Away from your face.
- Oh my gosh.
-  I know, it's
really weird to get used to,
but when you do ...
- I'm going to burn my hair.
-  Oh my gosh.
You've got to put your hair in it.
It's not. It's not.
Go lower.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
(laughter)
Put it a little lower.
Okay, clamp it and then push the button.
Other way, other way, other way.
(laughter)
- I don't like this.
-  Okay, not
stop, stop. (laughter)
- Now can I slide it out?
-  Yeah.
- Or do I have to unravel it out?
-  No, you can just let it go.
- Okay.
-  Do you like the curl?
- I do.
Is that too high up?
-  No. On the
most delicate piece ever.
(laughter)
- I know, so I can burn this one.
(laughter)
-  Don't be scared.
- This is the weirdest
flipping thing I've ever used.
-  But like,
don't you like the curl?
Isn't that a nice curl?
- Beach Waver, huh?
-  I didn't think that
it would make a difference,
and then I went back
to my old curling iron,
and I was like, "Oh".
- I feel like ... I
hate ... I have anxiety.
(laughter)
-  Because you think
you're going to fry your hair.
- Cause yeah, freakin' ...
-  You can like ... yep, yep.
- Yeah.
-  That's what I was going to say.
Just let it down just a little.
Look how cool the curl is.
It's pretty.
- Okay, so when I curl my hair tomorrow,
should I just curl all away from my face?
-  That's what I do, but you
always do one forward, one backward.
- Sometimes, not all the time.
-  Cute I like it.
- Should I do it curly or straight?
Curly.
(laughter)
I'm having anxiety.
-  I like curly.
It's soft and pretty.
- I like, just cut it, so I'm like,
"Oh, what am I doing with my hair?"
I don't even know how to fix it right now.
And to use this new bad boy?
-  It's fun.
- Thank you.
-  You're welcome.
- I'm gonna use all your stuff.
It is a pretty curl.
-  Yeah, it is.
- Okay.
