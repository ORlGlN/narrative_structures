- It's snowing.
Did you see it Jax?
Look at how much snow we got.
Did you see it Jackson?
(mumbles)
Did you see it?
- Yeah.
- Look out there.
Holy cow.
Are we gonna play in it today?
- Yeah.
- We're gonna have a white Christmas.
- Blue.
-  What were you singing?
- Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
- Just being himself.
Look at how much snow we have.
Oh my gosh.
Look at all that snow.
That's crazy.
We're gonna have a white Christmas.
(slow upbeat music)
Alright, on this beautiful snow day
we are building and
organizing our puzzles.
He doesn't know we're organizing.
He thinks we're just building it.
We just built this one
and we put it in the baggy
'cause that's one puzzle,
'cause all these puzzles were together.
Now let's build this puzzle.
- Yeah.
- Okay, scoot back, we'll
build that together.
So we're gonna build this puzzle
and once that's built and
we have all the pieces,
we'll put it in a bag.
What I want to do is get
like really small containers
rather than the bag, or actually,
probably a big container because I can
just leave these in bags
and then put these in the container.
That way our puzzles are more organized
and they're not all mixed.
This puzzle came in this
where it's like you have
a bunch of different
puzzles, but it's like
what kid is gonna keep that organized.
And that's just kind of
overwhelming for him.
- Look, they both match.
- Good job, let's keep going
and these are the perfect size puzzles.
This is great.
Jackson loves puzzles
and he loves learning,
and this has been so fun.
Calvin will come over here
once in awhile and help.
Calvin, what are you doing?
He's watching the snow fall guys.
It's beautiful out there.
Yup, that looks good.
- It fits.
- That's the other puzzle.
Okay, let's find a bag.
(laughing)
The things kids say.
I don't even know if you can hear Jackson
and I'm not gonna repeat it.
The holidays, where you
are cooking a lot more
and you just want your
home to feel a certain way.
Julie called me and I called her
and I was like this stupid
jello, I did it wrong
and she's like my stupid
rolls, it's all sticky.
So she's having issues, I'm having issues.
Though I will say my rolls are looking
pretty dang good.
Julie made this the
other day at the party.
It's pretzels with butter over it
that you cook for 10
minutes to harden it up
and then whipped cream and
cream cheese spread over the top
and then you refrigerate
it and then you put jello
over the top with some like
strawberries or raspberries
and it's a really, really good dessert.
So I'm making it right now.
This is the second time I've made it
because earlier I forgot
to do the whipped cream
and it was just cream
cheese and it was like
oh I didn't write the instructions.
So that's what I'm doing right now.
Guys, it's snowing and the
kids and I went into town.
I had a lunch date with them.
Jarred's finishing up work.
And it's gonna feel like the holidays
in about 20 minutes
because Jarred will be done
and we will play and eat (screaming).
Merry Christmas.
- Okay, we are doing some
major holiday preparation.
I have edited two vlogs this morning,
uploaded two vlogs today.
I have edited two more vlogs
and I'm rendering out
an animation right now
for the end of our Christmas special
that is going up on Christmas day,
so you've already seen it.
So you've already seen the animation,
but I'm doing it right now
and it is like three o'clock
in the afternoon.
I have been in my office
since seven this morning
and it is time to get out to the snow.
It has been snowing all day today.
We have like an additional foot of snow
and I cannot wait to get
outside and play with it.
I had a little tease of
myself because I went outside
and I plowed the driveway
with the four wheeler.
Can I just tell ya like I
love having to plow, Ellie.
Like I freaking love it.
- You were cute outside.
Jarred went in his office and worked
and then I hear the four
wheeler and I was like,
is Joel here?
And I look outside and Jarred's plowing.
(mumbles)
I was like oh my gosh,
he's outside like plowing.
- Yeah, it's so fun like because
there's just so much power behind it.
Oh man, I can't wait
to get out in the snow.
Ellie, I think what we should do,
so my brother Ryan is in
town and he brought his girl
and his wife, Maria, and
I think what we should do
is we should get the orange sled
and tie it to the four
wheeler and pull the kids
around on it.
Doesn't that sound like a blast?
- Do you have a rope that the kids?
Got it.
- Yes.
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
This is what I love about the wintertime.
I'm gonna be the first one down the slide.
I'm gonna be the first one down the slide.
You ready, Penny?
You ready, let's go.
Come on let's go.
Oh my gosh, there's so much snow.
(laughing)
Oh, do you remember when
you were just a puppy
and you would go in the snow
and it would just completely
cover you last year?
That was awesome.
(squeaking)
Oh yeah, is that so?
Ready, ready?
(growling)
Your grip is too strong.
A fresh slide just
waiting for me to go down.
(screaming)
(laughing)
Is it still good?
It's our last camera.
I should have brought the GoPro.
That's my hat Penny.
(laughing)
Okay, well that may have been
the last part of this camera
so I'm gonna hand it over to you
so it has safekeeping.
- We'll have fun, you just know that.
(slow upbeat music)
-  Look at Calvin
trying to get up those steps.
There's so much snow.
Hey Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.
Why are you holding onto your gloves?
- Because Penny can't get them.
-  Good job.
That's the rule huh?
Hold on to your gloves
so Penny doesn't get 'em.
(slow upbeat music)
-  Oh my goodness,
we're tredging through
such deep snow.
It's all the way up to your knees.
It's like past my boots.
That's crazy.
- Like a robot.
-  Yes, you do look like a robot.
You're exactly right, Jackson.
Alright buddy, I've got
it all set up for you.
Are you excited?
- There's no room for me.
-  Sure there
is, right in between.
You sit right there.
We've got a sled.
We've got a four wheeler.
You ready to rock?
-  Yes.
- Let's have some fun.
(slow upbeat music)
(laughing)
Whoa.
You guys crashed.
Why'd you crash?
(laughing)
Hey, hop back in and we'll get going.
Okay, you ready?
(slow upbeat music)
Hey.
Whoa.
(laughing)
Hey, Buzz Light year.
Hey, you kids.
Did you have fun on the
four wheeler, on the sled?
- Yeah.
- That was so much fun, huh?
Well, I've got a great idea,
something that we can do
before bedtime tonight.
I think we should call
Santa Claus on the phone.
Should we call Santa Claus on the phone?
- Yeah.
-  And see if he answers.
- Should we do that?
- Um-hum.
- Okay, ready?
Let's come over here.
We'll put it on speakerphone
so we can all hear.
Okay, ready?
Okay Google, call Santa Claus.
(beeping)
-  Hello there,
North Pole switchboard.
My name is Gumdrop,
connecting you to Santa
in the recording studio.
Just a sec.
- Do you hear that?
We're on hold with Santa Claus.
-  Santa, telephone.
-  A phone call well (laughing).
Hello, you caught me taking a little break
from my nice list work to get ready
for the big elf stock show.
You know, since you are
already on the nice list,
maybe you could help me out.
So, what do you say, do
you wanna help me out?
-  Can we help him?
-  Yeah.
-  I have a few questions for you.
Do you like music that
makes you jump around
like a monkey?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
(laughing)
-  That's a fun way to get exercise
like after you eat 100,000
cookies in one night and candy.
-  Whoa Santa, I just
had the strangest dream.
-  Please grab that thing.
-  It's a key tar.
-  What is a key tar?
I think our caller wants
to hear Claus and effect.
-  Wow, guess I wasn't dreaming.
-  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
♪ Jingle bells dance more swells ♪
♪ Drop that pasty J ♪
♪ Strobing lights up all night ♪
♪ Come on (mumbles) ♪
♪ Gotta dance until the break of day ♪
♪ Up, up, up in the club ♪
-  Do it again Cal.
-  Ho, ho, ho hurray.
-  Yeah, goodbye.
- Bye.
-  Okay, we'll start over.
-  Bye.
- That is so cool.
- We just called Santa Claus.
-  What did you think of him?
- Good.
- It was fun, huh?
He sang us a song and we danced.
-  And boom, look at the baby.
(mumbles)
Oh my gosh.
That's a good little bump.
It's a good little bump mister.
- It's a bump.
- It's a bump.
I went to take a picture of my bump
and Jackson came running up
to me and lifted up my shirt
and was looking at my stomach.
Oh my goodness, I can't go anywhere.
Calvin.
(screaming)
Mister, I almost stepped on you.
- Alright, listen up kiddos.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Come circle around me.
I have two arms and I need my children
to be in them.
Tomorrow is Christmas
Eve and we have not seen
enough Christmas movies, so
we are going to go downstairs
and we are going to sit
together as a family,
maybe have some popcorn
and maybe have some treats,
I don't know.
We'll just see where the night takes us.
Yeah treats, and we're gonna watch--
- Popcorn and candy canes.
- Oh, that sounds nice.
We're gonna watch a Christmas movie
and we'll get to the presents later.
I know you're very excited
about the presents.
We'll get the Christmas
presents in a little bit.
-  Okay, I'll get
the snacks so you guys
go lay a blanket out.
(slow music)
- You were spilling.
(laughing)
Mom, you were spilling.
- So much for trying to get (mumbles).
-  We're spilling.
- Mom's spilling everywhere.
We got M and Ms, we got
popcorn, we got chocolate milk
for the kiddos.
- We got a baby bump.
- Oh, your baby bump is so cute.
When we were on the phone with Santa Claus
I saw your baby bump and I was like
that's our little baby.
That's so sweet.
- I'm feeling really good.
- Good.
You're looking really good.
- I am situated.
The baby's comfy.
The kids are comfy.
Jackson chose The Grinch.
- Now I'm comfy.
- Do you feel just like (sighs).
- Yeah.
- It feels good just to--
- Well honestly, I have a
feeling I might fall asleep
watching this movie.
- It's okay.
- It's just nice to sit
and kick your feet up.
- And cuddle.
I cannot even believe this tonight.
- Look at your belly.
- I was taking picture of it
and I took a picture of it like this
and I was like that's not a good angle.
It was just like everything.
- I like angle a lot.
- I'll start the angle this way.
That looks better.
- There you go.
Hi baby.
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah.
Ellie, this is our little baby boy.
- Oh my gosh.
- How sweet.
- Mister.
- Merry Christmas baby boy.
- Oh, oh, it just kicked
- He's a soccer player.
- Next Christmas he
will be six months old.
- That's crazy.
- Crazy.
Watch The Grinch.
- The Grinch.
-  That seems like it'll do ya.
- Dropping a package my dear.
Packages.
-  Are you gonna
sit down and eat it?
-  Can I borrow your finger?
- Can I use your finger for a second?
- Hi.
- I was gonna scare
you, but then I thought
I probably shouldn't
scare a pregnant lady.
I was gonna say--
-  I might cry.
- I was gonna say, how do you
wanna end the blog tonight?
- I would have cried.
- And beat me to a bloody pulp.
Anyway, with that being said,
we had a wonderful evening.
We got the kids to bed and we did
some great Christmas preparation stuff
and we're very excited
about Christmas and--
- Our kids.
- The kids, yeah.
It's gonna be really great.
- Makes me excited.
I'm like just as excited
for them as they're excited.
- I know.
I was like that's the
thing about being a parent
during Christmas is you're
more excited about your kids
being excited than anything else
and that's the cool part about it.
So with that being said,
we are going to call it a night.
Thank you so much for watching.
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up
and we will see you guys tomorrow
where it is almost a brand new year.
2018 baby, it's our year.
Sorry, year.
Bye.
