- Happy Birthday to Joel!
I feel like I want to tell
you guys what we're thinking,
just so we're like all on
the same page, I guess.
- 'Cause there will be a lot of changes
when the baby comes, and
this is just one of them.
Are you reading the story, Calvin?
-  Yeah!
- Yeah?
In case we're not home by three o'clock,
we're going to Beaver Creek.
-  Okay.
Have a fun, safe time.
- Thank you, love you.
- Bye.
Happy Birthday to Joel!
It is Joel's birthday tomorrow!
So, Jared and Joel
are going on a fun, little man-date.
And I'm getting Jacks ready for school.
And then Bonnie is coming over,
and we're filming a make-up video.
And I have my own girl's day!
We did not plan our day to be like this,
but I'm doing like a girl's night
tonight with my girlfriends.
We're going to dinner, Jared's
doing a man-date with Joel.
So, we're kind of like switching today.
But I'm gonna get all
dolled up for tonight.
Are you showing Grandma the rocks?
- Um hum.
- Which is your favorite one?
- That one.
- Yeah, that one is in the key chain, huh?
I'm so glad it hasn't come out yet.
Awesome!
It feels weird that I'm going
on a little date tonight
without Jared, but I just
grabbed my purse to go,
and I kind of laughed at what was in it.
There's not much in here.
I've got chap-stick,
I've got lip gloss, a pen,
a dime, kid's sunglasses,
a sucker, floss,
an empty thing of gum,
Jared's pen that goes in his office,
and another lip gloss.
So, lip glosses and mouth
items is my go-to in there,
I guess.
- How do you think these
teeth get so white, right?
- I'm laughing because
the have got, that's why.
That's what it looks like.
- Put things in and out.
Well, you're going on a date today.
-  Uh huh.
- With your lady friends.
'Cause I went on a date
with my boy friend.
-  That's okay, your man friend.
- I went on a man-date with
Joel today, we had a lot of fun.
We went snowmobiling.
It was great.
It was nice to just step
away from the world.
Like we were on the tops
of the mountain and just
looking and appreciating
the beauty, the wind.
And like there was one
point in time where we just
stopped, turned off our machines.
We were on the highest point
in all of northern Utah.
-  Oh cool.
- And we just sat there and just did this.
-  And then did you pee?
- Yeah, we were peeing.
(laughing)
No, no, but seriously,
like it was nice to just
be in our thoughts
without any distractions.
- Yeah.
I do feel bad because I
didn't plan the day like this.
I probably wouldn't have because
I knew that Jared wasn't gonna film.
And then tonight, I'm going
with my old girlfriends
and I'm like, I feel like
it's mom's day and we're
gonna go to dinner.
I don't think I'm gonna film.
So, I probably wouldn't have normally
planned our day like this.
But that's how it is.
And before I head out,
this is like a crazy, like guys we have
something to tell you, sit down.
But it is something that
I want to talk about.
- And it's something that we've thought
about for a long time.
- Yeah.
Just because I feel like if I say it,
I'll feel at ease.
I don't know why that is,
but like when you do videos
for so long it's like, I'm like
I've been thinking this
and having it to myself.
I'm like, I feel like
I want to tell you guys
what we're thinking just so we're like
all on the same page, I guess.
Thank you guys for being so sweet
and supportive in my video.
Where I've had, I'm feeling much better.
Where the last few weeks,
I was feeling really down
in the dumps mentally.
I felt like I couldn't pick myself up.
I felt very just emotionally
and mentally drained.
And I feel like I'm starting
to come out of that.
Jared and I have been talking.
I've been voicing some
concerns of mine because,
I don't know if I should
just not even worry about it
and wait for the time to
come, and then decide.
And so Jared's like, so let's just
decide when the time comes.
But let's plan it for
now, so you feel at ease.
- Yeah.
- And I'm worried when the baby comes.
I'm worried about myself.
I'm worried about what if I have a lot of
post-partum depression
like I had with Calvin,
but I don't do anything and I just like
kind of tough through it.
'Cause I didn't know what it was.
I was just like, "Oh, I'm okay."
And like, I ended up just
becoming even busier.
Because I was thinking
that it will distract me
and then I ended up crashing.
And I just had a really
hard time after Calvin.
And I, I worry about myself.
So I asked Jared, awhile ago,
and it wasn't that our
conversation went bad
but it's just, we kind
of didn't talk about it.
I mentioned it, and it kind of
didn't get brought up again.
- Well, I think you
mentioned it, and I was
just like, "No."
- Like we won't do that.
- No, I don't want to do that.
- And then I mentioned it again, and then,
I mentioned it again.
- And I think what it
came down to is like,
yeah, you mentioned it,
but I wasn't necessarily
thinking of you first.
And I think that's really important.
Because I need to think of you first.
And that's where we came down to this.
Is like okay, we need to look inward
before we look outward.
- And I, I just asked Jared
if when the baby comes,
we took a year off last year, and it.
(laughing)
We took a week off last
year, and it was very
refreshing, we loved that.
- It was great.
- And we decided, okay,
every year it would be nice
to take a full week.
That would be awesome.
When the baby comes in
five months, I would like
to do Monday through Friday.
That way it gives us the weekend.
'Cause Sundays are very repetitive.
We go to church, we come home
and we honestly, just sit.
It's just our day to like, sit.
And so, it's repetitive.
And I said I would love to take
Saturdays and Sundays
off when the baby comes.
Because that will give us
an opportunity to really
focus on us on Sundays,
and then on Saturdays,
really just like put
everything away and unwind.
And then that way, we're fresh for Monday.
Regardless, we're all going to
be exhausted with a new baby.
And I just feel like
that might be something
good for me, to look forward
to knowing the weekend
comes, and all I have to
do is think about the kids,
and that's my only thought.
- We've been filming
where we're two days ahead
and that has been great.
- Amazing.
- It has been wonderful.
And I just think while
the baby is here, that
would be even more help.
- Yeah.
- It would be even more nice to have time
to disconnect for that.
Being two days ahead is nice, but I think
when the baby comes, it'll be even better.
And we're still going to do
daily vlogs until that point.
- Yes.
- That's the plan.
- And we'll just see how I personally feel
when the time comes.
I'm grateful for Jared,
for being open-minded.
It's taken a long time for us to have
a conversation of us both
being okay and on the same
page about this decision.
I hope that everybody is understanding.
I'm sure you will be.
But that's what I'm going to plan on,
just to ease myself right now.
I don't want to have to think about
the future stress about it.
But my personality is that,
and so to me to be calm
right now, I just need me
to say this is what I'm doing
for me to feel good about it.
So, thank you for being
good to me right now.
- It's so, yeah.
- It's what I need.
- Well, it's just funny
because you say like,
"That's my personality."
Oh, to a freaking T!
It's your personality to
look forward, to plan ahead,
to set yourself up for
different situations.
Nothing is 100% set in stone.
- Yeah.
- And we are looking to take care
of ourselves and our family.
And things can change.
- And it might.
- And no matter what, no matter
what, it's going to be good.
It's going to be good.
- That's where we're at right now.
I just wanted to voice my opinion
and have an open conversation, so that
I feel at ease and good about
just talking about this.
So, on with the rest of the vlog.
Thank you guys for understanding.
I just wanted to put that out there now
so that everyone has like
five months to kind of prep.
(laughing)
And so we do too.
- Five months to prepare.
- For the baby!
Woohoo!
- 'Cause there will be a
lot of changes when the baby
comes, and this is just one of them.
We didn't have a lot of
success the last time
we did this, but we're
going to try it again.
Okay kids, circle up!
Okay kids, circle up!
- Dada!
Let's circle up.
- I'll take it, I'll
take it, all right guys,
so it is a beautiful day
outside and I am just
grateful that the sun is
shining, the warm air is upon us.
It is a beautiful day.
So, we are going to spend our time
outside before it gets
dark, does that sound good?
- Yeah.
- Daddy's gonna clean up some
of our mess from fire pit.
We're gonna throw the wood where it
needs to go, and do some more poop patrol.
And you guys can play on the slide
and just do whatever you want.
(children chattering)
- Even put that frame on
your head, yeah, I guess
you can do that.
All right frame-head, put the frame down
and let's go outside.
-  Put it down, frame-head!
-  Good job!
Okay, let's go outside!
(happy guitar music)
Hi guys, how are you?
- Good.
- Good.
Are you reading the story, Calvin?
Yeah.
Hey, was it hot, or cold, or warm outside?
- Cold.
-  It was pretty cold?
Was it cold to wear winter gear
or did you have fun?
- Have fun.
- Yeah, good.
It's starting to warm up a little bit.
That's kind of nice, isn't it?
We had a blast outside.
It was nice and warm.
I got a lot of clean-up done.
The kids played with Penny.
It was a beautiful thing.
Now, we're going to read a book.
Can you guys say
goodnight to your friends?
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!
- Love you, bye!
As you know, Ellie is out
with all of her lady friends.
She actually went all the
way down to Salt Lake.
So, I hope she is having a blast.
Joel and I had
a freaking blast on the
mountain snowmobiling.
We only got stuck three times each.
And actually, while we were
there, when we were stuck,
trying to dig ourselves
out, someone drove by.
Luckily, it was actually pretty cool.
He taught us a different way
than we thought to get the machines out.
With four-wheelers and jet-skis,
it's like kind of taboo.
You you don't do this.
You don't roll the machine over
like its handlebars to
get it back onto its end.
But with snowmobiles, he's
like, "Oh yeah, that's
"the only way we do it."
it's so much easier than
trying to dig yourself out.
Because you're digging, and then lifting,
and pulling, and rolling
it is so much easier.
So every time after that, Joel
and I just rolled the machines over.
And we did it, and it was so much easier.
Because if you've ever gone
snowmobiling before, getting
stuck is like the worst
thing ever, but it's kind
of part of the adventure.
So, we learned something new.
We had a blast and Joel's
birthday is tomorrow,
so Happy Birthday Joel.
That's kind of why we did it.
It was for his birthday.
So, kids are asleep.
We have had a great night.
We dropped some information on you
and nothing is changing yet.
And I don't want you to
think this is a big change.
This isn't too crazy.
But when we have the baby things
are gonna be a little bit different.
We're excited about that
and it's gonna be great.
So, thank you so much for your support.
Thank you so much for understanding
and we're so grateful for you.
We are grateful for each
and every one of you.
So, thank you for tuning in with us every
single day, to be a part of our family.
So, thank you guys.
And with that, I'm going to end the night.
Thank you guys for watching and we will
see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
