-  Yay!
- Tail.
-  Is she biting her tail?
She's got a little itch
and that's how she itches.
But don't bite her tail.
She doesn't want you to bite her tail.
Good morning Sister Sue.
Good morning, good morning Penny.
It's so good to see you.
- Hey.
-  Hey.
Good morning Calvin.
Uh-oh and for the big
jump, three, two, one!
You get both jumps.
- Do you know what Valentine's Day is?
- Mmm-hmm.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
(Jared laughs)
- Valentine's day, do
you remember last year
we made cards for all of our friends?
- Mmm-hmm.
- We're gonna go pick out cards,
and you're gonna write
your name on it this year,
because you can do your letters.
So you'll write your name, Jackson,
we'll put a piece of candy on the cards
and we're gonna send it to your friends.
And you'll save some for school okay?
- Candy?
- Yeah.
- The kids have been doing so amazing
at sleeping in their beds.
They've been sleeping through the night
and that's always been
a big struggle for us,
especially with Calvin, is
sleeping through the night.
But I'm happy to say, there
has been such huge improvement.
Jackson does not wake up in the
middle of the night anymore.
He doesn't come out.
He doesn't come into our bedroom.
And neither does Calvin.
Calvin woke up once yesterday
and that was it.
He went down back to bed really quick
and that was it.
We're getting sleep.
(laughs)
- And Jackson, you're just
being a very good listener.
-  Yes.
- Like we just tole him, you
just can't wake up anymore.
You gotta stay in bed.
Really that's all we've told him,
you can't get out of bed any more.
-  Mmm-hmm.
- Bribed him with a few treats,
(laughs)
a few prizes
and it's worked awesome.
- Waaa, poo poo.
-  Yeah it has worked awesome.
I'm proud of you.
- Poo poo.
- And that's the thing,
I love seeing improvement
and growth and development from the kids.
That's the most rewarding
thing to see as a parent,
-  Totally.
- Is to see change from them
and them making the decision,
because they could decide not to do it.
They could to that,
but they want us to be happy
and they know that they get a little prize
and they know that it's gonna go away.
Those prizes won't stay forever.
But after awhile, it'll become the norm.
And that's what I love
is seeing you grow and develop
and become a contributing
member of society.
(Jared laughing)
- I want to wear your earrings.
- No, it would hurt your little ears.
-  You don't have
holes in your ears to wear it.
- It would hurt.
We're gonna go okay?
- Okay, where's your other one, hey.
-  Do you like 'em, are you pretty?
- Do you know that
Grandma gave them to me?
- I love my plaid.
-  Like right this second.
- Four minutes and 48 seconds.
-  Ah!
-  So we are in
the Hamilton waiting room.
This is where they see
Hamilton tickets for Salt Lake.
-  Okay, the one thing, ah!
- I gotta read this.
Okay, hello Hamilton fans--
- Okay, you read, I'll vlog.
- Jared and I a long time ago,
when he was going to New York,
he's like you should come with me
and we'll go to the Hamilton.
We had been traveling a lot at the time
and I just needed to
be home with the kids.
And I was like one day if they ever come
to Utah, we'll go.
And Jared did an email sign up
so that they'll tell you when
the tickets are available,
so tons of people are waiting right now
to buy Hamilton tickets Salt Lake
and it's for our birthdays in April,
that's when they're coming.
So I was like, let's get tickets for us
and we'll go for our birthdays.
I hope we can get 'em.
- What day is gonna be best for us?
Should we do the 20th,
between our birthdays?
-  I'm looking.
- What days is it even going?
The best availability is April
18th to May 6th, okay so--
- Are you sure you want do do it that
or do you want to do it
on your birthday the 21st?
- It's birthday month Ellie,
all month long.
- Okay
- It'll be in between,
so we'll do the 20th,
maybe we'll stay the night in a hotel.
and then go shopping
or play on your birthday.
- That would be magic.
-  Would that be fun?
- Oh yeah.
-  Oh my gosh!

- Oh we still gotta wait?
-  You have an hour.
Because is that by order,

- I guess, maybe who's
been in the waiting room.
Dangit.
- Yep.
- Okay, in one hour we
might be able to get them,
we might not.
- Oh please bless.
- I want to go on our birthdays.
-  Okay, I'll let you stay here.
We're gonna go buy Valentine cards.
- I'm not moving from this seat.
-  Okay (laughs).

-  Wow, okay I want you
to pick out another one, okay?
This one if you want that one
but pick out some cards, okay?
- Ow!
- Calvin honey.
- You stepped my hand.
-  Well I stepped on your hand,
because you're laying on the ground.
Come on, good job, push it in there.
Calvin's not having a good time.
Push it in.
(Calvin crying)
Good job, do you want to pull the strap?
Okay pull 'em.
What one do you want?
What one should you do, Peppa or PJ Masks?
- Peppa.
- Okay, let's put Peppa in the cart.
Alright, after a war,
I will hold your rock,
(laughs)
you found in the road.
- All gone.
- Is it all gone?
After a little experience,
Calvin was very mad at his shoe being off
and wouldn't let me help him.
It is on and we are happy now.
- I found these.
- Look, they have these.
- Wow, Peppa stickers?
I love to share happy
positive fun moments,
and I just want to share with you
that the little rug rat is asleep.
(laughs)
Okay, went to the grocery store,
Calvin was very upset
that his shoe was off, he
didn't want me to help him,
he kind of threw himself to the ground.
Then we went to another aisle.
I don't even know how it happened
but the cleaner, the bottle broke
and cleaner got everywhere.
It was like a plastic bottle too.
The check out line was crazy.
My card is not working.
We have to go to the bank.
We need to figure out a pin.
I got a new card.
It's been an issue, and it works sometimes
and sometimes it doesn't.
And then I had left my other card
at a restaurant a week ago,
which I need to go pick up,
but it's an hour and a half a way.
The grocery store trip was not peaceful
and heaven, like a lot of times it is.
I love grocery shopping with my kids,
because I think it's fun
that they stay right by me
and it usually is really fun.
Today was not the case.
So I'm in the driveway waiting for Jared,
because he's gonna come out,
we're gonna run to the bank,
figure out card stuff,
go back, get all of our groceries,
pay for them, that's the status.
Calvin is asleep.
Mr. Jackson, I am
unbelievably proud of you.
You were a very well-behaved
boy today, thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
You're a good boy.
Let's get on with our day,
so we can make Valentine's Day cards.
- So one of the issues
with the cards declining
is actually a captioning
service that we use.
If you guys didn't know, every single one
of our videos, at least
for the past two years
I think, has captions.
And that captions allows
people who are hard of hearing
to know what's going on
and know what we're saying
in the vlog.
It also allows easier
translations on videos,
so people of different languages
can watch our videos.
That's a price that we
pay every single day.
And for some reason, our bank flagged it
and was like sorry, we're not
letting you do that anymore.
And we were like oh man.
And that was the block
that caused all of the other issues
that are going on right now.
So I just called and got that
lifted, but Ellie's card--
-  So we can do Rev.
- Yeah, so we can still do that.
Ellie's card is under a different name,
your name at that matter,
-  I hope so.
- and they wouldn't let me fix your card,
so we have to go in and take care of that.
Happy Friday!
- Yay!
We're doing Monday
things on Friday, right?
- Dangit.
It's okay, we're gonna make
Valentine's Day cards, huh Jackson?
- Yep.
- Yep.
Alright, so here's the situation.
I put my Jack from This is Us pants on
and I saved the day.
I've got the groceries right here
from the store and I
fixed all of our cards
so they will not be declining anymore.
When they put those
blocks on, super annoying,
but we got the groceries,
the day can now officially start.
Everything that you saw beforehand,
the day had not started yet,
mmm-mmm, didn't start.
Now, it's officially started.
-  These flowers
have been in the water
for two weeks and they have lasted,
look at that.
They look brand new,
for two weeks they have stayed alive
and I love them.
-  Let me do.
-  Okay good job.
Now trace these bottom one's okay?
Jackson is wrapping up his cards.
He definitely would rather trace over mine
than do his own.
We're working on that, huh?
You're doing so good
and are you gonna pass
these out at school?
- Mmm-hmm.
This is hard work.
-  You're doing so good.
I love it.
He really wants one.
Do you want to do one sticky for yourself?
Use on windows or mirrors.
Do you want to go put it on our window?
Or you could put it on here.
- No, I want to do it on the wall.
-  Okay go put it on a wall.
- The window.
-  Perfect.
- I'm behind a bit.
But this is super duper hard.
Not two greens.
-  I got it, yeah.
Ready?
Boom!
Ready ready ready ready ready ready?
Go!
Boom!
That was a bad kick.
(yelling)
(yelling)
(laughing)
- Do you know how Mommy
and Daddy go on dates?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well you are going on
a special date with us.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?
- Popcorn!
- What are we gonna see?
- The dream movie.
- The dream movie.

- Calvin, what happened?
- I bonked my head.
-  You bonked your head?
- You bonked your head right there.
Oh my baby boy.
Look at that cut.
I think you're gonna be okay,
I don't think it needs stitches.
-  Yeah, I don't think it does.
- But we're gonna ask
Uncle Joel and Aunt Bonnie.
Okay?
- What about Dad?
(laughs)
- Well just a second opinion.
- I'm kidding.
- Calvin are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you saying that they're
expert at stitches by now?
- Well yeah, they have
had more damages doot.
- I'm just kidding.
-  Cal, Calvin, what happened?
- I bonked my head.
-  You bonked your head?
- He's showing.
- Gosh dangit, it's
like your kids get hurt
when they're not with you, I swear.
But he'll be okay, you tough little boy,
you got blood on your pants.
- He is tough.
- Oh no.
-  Dangit.
Well the thing is, is it looks deep.
I don't know, that's deep.
I know it's not bleeding a lot,
but I feel like that's pretty open.
We'll see, you're a tough boy, huh?
He bonked his head.
- He bonked his head?
- Ooh.
-  Now he's showing ya.
-  But look at
it, I mean I don't think
it needs stitches, but--
You don't think so.
Owie Cal.
Woo.
- Does that tickle?
- He smiling.
- Does that tickle?
Good job bud.
-  All done?
- Not all done.
- Just hold it right there.
- Just hold it there.
- Can you fold your arms?
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Two.
- Good job.
You know, it's kinda been a rough day.
We've had a little bit of a rough day.
And that's okay,
But just to recap, Ellie had a hard time
at the grocery store.
Calvin had a hard time
at the grocery store.
I guess Calvin's had a rough day.
- Calvin poor thing.
- Calvin bonked his head.
But guess what, I'm about
to drop another bomb.
-  What?
- Some bad news.
-  Oh yeah.
- Hamilton is sold out.
We didn't get tickets.
We were in line for hours,
online, so we weren't really in line,
but we were in virtual line.
- Dangit.
- We can't go see Hamilton in Salt Lake,
but all in all, just
because days are rough
doesn't mean the next day
isn't going to be great.
Ellie and I are gonna call it a night.
And we want to thank you for watching.
Calvin is doing great.
He's very very happy.
But that is where we're
going to end this vlog,
so thank you guys so much for watching.
If you enjoyed it, ugh,
that sounds kind of weird,
if you enjoyed our terrible day,
(laughs)
give the video a big thumbs up
and we will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
