- It's time to have
fun, and practice hard!

Look at the beautiful mountains of Utah.

- Felt very uncomfortable,
- Yeah.

-  We've got one camera,
two camera, three camera, lights!
- And this time we actually
- Action.
- have Jared to make sure
the footage goes smoothly,
because I am a crappy camera person.
- I wouldn't say that.
I forget all the time.
Bonnie and Ellie were
here a couple days ago,
filming this amazing make-up video,
and the mic was off.
- And it was blurry.
- Blah!
- And it was half my, it was my fault.
- So, lets show you what we got here.
We've got our first half.
Look at that.
Isn't that great?
Look at the depth of field.
Look at the volume of the background.
(laughing)
Okay, and then we got this camera, okay.
We're working guys.
We're working on Tuesday morning.
- It's like your legs shaking
when you're doing piano.
(electronic piano music)
- Okay, my favorite part.
- I love when you do videos like this,
because you laugh so much, and I just love
seeing you laugh

Hey buckaroo how was school today?
- Good.
-  Good, did you learn anything?
- Yep.
-  What'd you learn?
- More letters.
-  Oh, you learned
your letters more?
- Mmhm.
- Good, did you get a gem today?
What? One gem?
Yay! You got a gem!
Why do you get a gem?
- Because.
- Do you get gems when you do nice things?
Awe. Great job buddy.
I'm proud of you.
Ellie and I have a couple
meetings out of town today,
so we are running around.
Grabbing a couple things before we go.
Ellie's actually already down there.
Her and Bonnie went earlier.
I'm trying to vlog
and think of what I need
to get at the same time,
and it's not working.
I need to grab a couple things,
but while Ellie's in one of the meetings,
I'm going to take the kids,
and we're gonna try and
find something fun to do
while we wait for one meeting to finish,
and then another meeting to start.
We are going to go to,
hopefully somewhere fun.
We're gonna try and find
something fun to do. Kay?
Are you okay with doin' something fun?
- What are we gonna go?
- I dunno, we've gotta find it.
And then we're gonna
go see grandma Griffis.
Yeah buddy! Kay.
(children laughing)
You guys are so silly!
(children laughing)
You're so silly! Huh?
You're so silly!
We've got an hour drive ahead of us,
so I have pulled up auditable,
and we are listening to a book called,
The Power of Starting Something Stupid,
by my buddy Richie Norton,
and we're listenin' to
that, havin' a good time,
admiring the beauty and
all of the melting snow
'cause it is 38 degrees
where we are right now.
38, that means it's not freezing.
That means the snow is melting.
Can you believe it? It's happening!
(soft instrumental music)
-  We've made it.
Guys, the tree house museum.
Up this way? Okay.
They have games up here?
-  Yeah!
- You'll have to show me.
We're at the tree house museum.
I've never been here before,
but I know Ellie has taken the kids,
and they just love it.
Oh, you bonked your head?
Do you want me to kiss it?
(smooch)
You better? Okay, let's play.
A kiss from dad works wonders.
- Hold my hand.
-  I'll hold your hand, okay.
Where are we goin'?
- We have to go.
Super wizard, muscle!
-  Let's play this with you!
(soft instrumental music)
-  Do you wanna see something cool?
Kay, watch this.
Can you try it?
- Yeah.
- Right on your finger,
oh that works, too!
(laughing)
Kay, ready?
Hey!
Awe!
Yeah! High five.
While we are playing,
I'm using technology.
I am in the future is what it feels like.
I'm watching Elon Musk launch
SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch.
He's got a Tesla Roadster two in there,
that he's gonna launch.
Jackson, look. You see this?
- Yeah.
-  We are going to
watch a rocket launch today.
Do you see the rocket?
- Yeah.
-  Is that so cool?
It's gonna launch in like two minutes,
and we're gonna watch
it take off into space.
Can you believe that?
Do you wanna watch it?
- I wanna watch it on your phone.
-  Okay, let's go
sit down and watch it.
Let's go get Calvin and we'll watch it.
Calvin we're gonna watch
it launch right over there.
Kay? Do you wanna watch?
- No
-  No? Okay.
Do you wanna know what's
cool about this, Jackson?
- Mmhmm.
- Is we are witnessing history right now.
This is history in the making,
and we're watching it together.
This is a historic space
launch, rocket launch
- See?
- Yeah. Looks really cool. Kay here we go!
Nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one,
blast off! There it's gonna go!
Look it's goin'!
(laughing)
We're watching a rocket launch.
Falcon Heavy just took off to the sky.
That rocket is gonna launch
a car into outer space,
and it's gonna orbit
Mars for a billion years,
or a million years, or
somethin' like that.
There it goes.
It's going 2,000 kilometers per hour,
and it's 20 kilometers in the sky.
- Where's the rocket?
-  It's right there,
it's that white thing.
- The rocket's on fire.
- That's the boosters.
It's powering it through the sky.
They had a successful
separation. Oh my god.
The coolest thing about this
rocket is that it lands,
like it lands on a buoy out on a ocean.
And they just had successful
separation. Oh my gosh.
10,000 kilometers per hour.
This is the deploy.
Look at it, that's the car
they launched into space.
That's the Roadster. Don't Panic.
It's playing Space Oddity by David Bowie.
Boosters have landed. Oh my gosh.
Hey bud, you climbin' all the way up?
There you are Jackson! Kay,
hook somethin' on there.
(laughing)
You got it? Is it hooked on?
Oh no! It's a parachute.
Oh that's okay.
Alright, I'm gonna send her back up.
Here she comes. Kay, grab
it and then throw it down.
Okay, do it, do it, do it.
Whoa! I missed it again.
Give me some motorcycle sounds.
(rumbles)
(screeches)
Oh no! Turbulence.
(laughing)
Look at these heroes savin' the day. Yeah!
Do you guys wanna be firemen?
- Yes.
- Yeah!
Excuse me sir, could I buy
10 pounds of chocolate?
Yes, okay!
I didn't think it'd work!
Oh yes, put the money in,
and then I'll take all of the candy.
Candy? You have candy?
Okay, I'll take some.
Can I have some change?
- Uhuh.
-  Thank you.
Oh my gosh, did you find a baby?
- Yes ah.
-  Oh yeah, are

- No, dis wa.
- Oh, can you give the baby a kiss?
He found the baby a brother mount.
Are you ready to be a big brother?
What a good kid.
- I gotta baby!
-  You got a
baby? Kay, bring 'em out.
- It's a sad baby.
-  It's a sad baby?
Maybe we can make him happy.
Oh, he does look kinda sad.
He looks kinda like a 60 year
old in a baby's body, huh?
(laughing)
Awe, that's such a good big brother, huh?
You guys are so good, and so loving.
I know our little baby
brother is going to love
being with you boys, huh?
- Mmhmm.
- Mmhmm.
I kinda feel like this doctor behind me
is secretly judging me
and my life decisions.
Hey, I'm a good guy.
Is that your baby?
- No, it's sad baby.
-  Oh, it's a sad baby?
- Ahaa.
-  How can you make 'em happy?
Oh, let's put him back.
Oh, so gentle. Good job.
-  This is not a baby!
-  Is that Muppet?
- A puppet!
- A puppet?

Can you rock the baby to sleep? Good job.
(vrooms)
How bad does your head hurt right now?
(laughing)
- Um.
(laughing)
- Both of you, I'm
asking both of you guys.
If I knew how, to like,
pop your necks like Landon
I would do that right now.
- That's okay.
Um, our, the cook, the family
cookbook is going to be
a piece that is gonna go from--
- It's gonna be artwork.
- Generation to generation.
We just spent over hundreds
and hundreds of pictures.
- And we have hundreds and hundreds more.
- I don't have any words I wanna say,
just that it was really
a good morning to work,
but also, like, I can't wait for like our
kids and grandkids to have this book.
- Mmhmm. So Bonnie and
Ellie just had their
first meeting that I told you about,
and then we just finished up
our second meeting, non-stop.
-  Without stopping.
- And without eating!
- And guess what? I don't want to say this
in front of Bonnie, but
you don't like me anyway.
I'm goin' to In and Out.
- You bet you, yes!
(smacking)
Get it girl! That's my girl!
- I'm gonna go home
and have another apple.
(laughing)
- I'll just have this water. I'm full.
Name that movie.
Alright, enough of that business stuff,
no one cares about business talk,
it's time to have fun and practice hard.

He doesn't even know we're watching him.
That's the funny part.
He's loving this. He's
looking for the key.
(laughing)
And he's out.
(laughing)
Hi Cal.
- Grandpa's gonna be so exited.
- Grandpa just got home?
Can you hear him?
I feel like I should be in
a Carl's Jr. Commercial.
-  Oh baby! Move
over Kim Kardashian.
- Over.
-  You've got the moves.
-  Oh my goodness.
Look at the beautiful mountains of Utah.
- I've mentioned in tweets
and on the videos that
my mind has just been going a lot lately,
I've been motivated for things,
talking about old projects,
new projects, and the book
that I've been listening to
really struck a chord with me today,
and a quote from Jim Carrey
has been striking a chord a chord with me.
Jim Carrey said, "you can fail
at something that you hate,
so you might as well try
something that you love."
You know, and I've been
thinking about, like,
Elon Musk, today he launched a rocket
and landed two of them on a barge,
and he sent a Tesla into orbit,
and it going to be in Mars orbit.
When he started doing Tesla,
SpaceX, and all of that stuff,
even PayPal, back in the day,
people thought it was crazy,
people thought it was weird,
people didn't think he was
going to be successful.
Same thing with Steve Jobs,
same thing with Jeff Bezos with Amazon.
People thought these things
were weird, and different,
and a failure, and I can't
help but think of the whole,
like, vlogging movement.
When we started vlogging,
people thought it was different,
people thought, even family thought,
you're a little weird for doin' that.
- It was weird. We felt
very uncomfortable,
especially around certain people,
but that's okay.
- Yeah, and I could not be
more proud about where we are,
and what we're doing.
- And now it's very normal, like you,
I mean it's not like everyone's vlogging,
but just social media,
and like, Instagram,
Instagram stories, Facebook,
just like, not just vlogging,
but like, the way the news is.
They vlog style the news a
lot and it's just common.
- Yeah. It was weird, but
now it's becoming normal.
We're at that point in time
where things like this have shifted.
Now people are seeking after
Elon Musk, praising Elon Musk.
I mean look at Apple,
the most valuable company
in the world, Amazon, Jeff--
- Except hate that they
don't have a home button.
- Right.
- That's why I'm not gonna switch.
- To the ten?
Jeff Bezos is the
richest man in the world,
I think is what the most recent thing is,
and vlogging, social media is so normal,
and I just can't help but
think about the new projects
that we have going on, the
things that we're thinking of,
the things that we're planning.
People might think it's different.
- Yeah.
- People might think it's weird,
but that just makes everything
a little bit more exiting.
- And if it's special
to you, it is special,
like the cookbook, it's
like pictures of our food,
but to us that's very special.
- It is very special,
and I just wanted to say this, like,
with what you're doing people
might think it's weird,
but you keep doing it,
because there may come a time in your life
where people will be wishing
that they were with you
when it was happening.
I think Will Smith said like,
"if you're absent during my struggle,
don't be expect to be
present during my triumph".
- Amen.
- You know?
So, there's lots of things
happening in the world.
Lots of changes are going on,
and we're gonna seek after those things,
and we're gonna accomplish our plans,
and I'm exited, and if they fail,
that's just a stepping
stone into something new
- And that's like anything,
like my hand lettering,
I've been loving doing that,
like this is not like
some huge, elaborate,
like this is even just simple stuff
that may be simple to some people,
but it's really hard for me,
and I'm gonna do good at it.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- And I'm proud of myself
today when we were doing notes,
everyone had computers, but
I was in charge of the notes,
and I'm proud of myself.
My handwriting looked good.
- Good, and that's the
thing, just baby steps,
work one step at a time.
I'm feeling motivated, and
that's just what I want is to
leave it with you today.
- That's sweet.
- So--
- I love that.
- Thanks for watching guys.
I hope you're feeling
it just as much as I am,
because big things are commin',
and we gotta pack.
- Yes, tomorrow we get
to look at baby products!
- Whoo!
So, until then, we'll
see you guys next time.
- Bye
- Bye
