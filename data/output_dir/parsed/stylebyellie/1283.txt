put it in my mouth and he did with my
belly what does it say about the oh I'm
sorry
boy can got fruit mmm seriously like
where did you get all of this stuff I
was sleeping and I have no idea where I
came from sometimes it's fun just to get
out of the house so that Jackson has
something else to crawl on other than
just the carpet in the tile ha ha ha he
agrees he loves the grass he pulls at it
and we kind of try and not eat it but
sometimes we do uh-huh but um I don't
know I feel kind of really good today I
felt kind of rejuvenated after going and
visiting all of our family yesterday and
it just felt really good
so my Monday has already started off
really good because I visited family and
so now I'm just refreshed for the new
week good beer come here
no he's just interested in the grass
today that's it he doesn't want us ball
he doesn't want toys he just wants the
grass so we're gonna spend the afternoon
keeping our tongues out get in the grass
and try not to eat too much dirt it's
okay to eat a little dirt as long as you
don't eat a lot of dirt put Jackson and
you're slowly falling over more I
haven't put in Jackson in like two-piece
outfits for a while because sometimes
when they're babies like they're just
tummies show and it like it's just kind
of annoying to me but he looks like such
a big boy and is two-piece outfit there
