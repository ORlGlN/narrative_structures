hey guys it's Tuesday it is day 13 and
it's quite late in the day after 2 p.m.
this small it's not been the best
Tuesday all right life but um this
morning woke up and did some editing and
then we went to the gym and we combat
curve like got dressed and stuff I've
got a video I need to film actually I'm
not really feeling like it right now and
yeah that's a lot stays gonna consist of
try and make it as good as possible am I
going to the cinema tonight to see
suffragette because it looks so good and
I think I think I came out yesterday and
yeah cuz I know yesterday's vlog was
really short and I don't they still look
to be as short but some days it's kind
of hogs if you're just doing work and
stuff it's kind of hard to fill in just
fill it in with things but yes hope
you're well
Jason is going to go and get some some
bits and books from Tesco so I'm just
waiting for him to get back and I'm just
drinking armored car fare and someone's
coming to fix our coffee machine pick
him today
later on so yes if anyone really wants
dogs especially plural dogs but and it's
like thinking about it and wants any
advice I just have to say they're
definitely a lot more work than you
think they are some day look some days
they're you know not as much work and
then some days it's like Jesus Christ
but yeah they dogs are little work I I
didn't realize before because we've
always had a family dog so my mum would
do a lot of the dog stuff you know that
it's like you don't even realize how
much mums do and then when you have when
you've got your own stuff to do you
realise so yeah if you like a free and
easy life probably don't get it dog yet
in case you wondered ah what did I wear
this before I think I did I'm wearing
Estee Lauder's quiet riot I really like
it's like a matte color but it's not
really drying and it sets so quickly I
really like it man of the house come

all better
I just film filming I just filmed I just
finished filming the video that I needed

that's like a bit of a weight off and
we're yeah we're gonna go to the cinemas
soon and yeah I mean I haven't been
filming like I said earlier I haven't
been filming um life looking a lot of
the day because I've just been feeling a
bit down like most of the day so you
know it just happens sometimes and I
just haven't really felt like there's
nothing I've felt like showing or
talking about but it should change we're
gonna do I say I'm gonna go see
suffragette we looked it up though and
it's got really low on IMDB so we're not
I'm just really hoping it's worth the
trip I really hope so let me know if
you've seen it I mean it'll be tonight
by them but let me know what you thought
with a film of you seen it if you're
wondering my dress is from Free People
and I love it I don't know if it's still
available but if it is all in kit so
I've got to tidy up my room and then
I'll go downstairs and then we'll leave
soon so we're just walking Frank oh I
didn't say so so we're in the house and
stuff just after I filmed and Riley Ryan
he was limping on his back leg so we
thought because he's got a funny me that
sometimes dislocates I'm either they'll
something wrong with his knee or that
there was that problem and happened we
were gonna go to cinema he booked it and
stuff but he was limping so it was
obviously really worrying and when I was
looking at his leg he had like something
was kind of kind of on his leg slash in
his fur and it looks really odd I didn't
know what it was but I just pulled it
out and it looks a little bit wet and I
just didn't think anything of it
I know it's just something from the
garden and and then we took him to the
vet and then I mentioned that and it
turns out that oh and his foot was
swollen and it turns out that he was
stung in the garden so you also got
stung by wasps or something with him so
he's at home because his foot so swollen
and he's had an T what a
anti-inflammatory pills antihistamine
and yes so little Riley's at home and uh
we were out with Frank we don't want to
aggravate his swollen poor Frank's the
insta like this one on one walk so where
could it go because I really would like
to kind of get out the house this
afternoon Sasha evening collecting
Franklin because he loves playing with
these dogs way too much okay he was
coming back to us and then he got
distracted and like ran all the way back
to play
old-fashioned human research line
eat it nice I got sufferin muscles
that's so good and fine and I got a 10
ounce sirloin steak cooked medium-rare
with a rocket and Parmesan size and it
should be lovely
the mill was really nice enough my chips
they were like Burger King chips they're
the best
now we're gonna go to well we're gonna
go to a 24-hour Starbucks and going get
hot chocolate and then go back home and
watch mr. Holmes
and have a nice evening how'd you like
the meal quality I'm excited
Friday I've got my
my motorbike test again which I fail at
the first time which is ridiculous by
the way
they they did they said I couldn't pass
because I was holding up traffic and by
that there was a van behind me
there was a mini roundabout it's coming
up soon around the bow on the right
which in England I supposed to give way
to the guys coming on the ride and there
was a guy he'd gone round and I could
have slowly crept behind him and kept
going
I feel better be safe I just stopped
then get really ahead so safe and I
stopped and because I stopped he said I
know how not traffic littering it - two
seconds and there was only one van
that's the Friday piling and also I'm
getting my hair done so really excited
I think it'll be a bit like to like a
bit of a different tone
texture well also excited for everyone
to see all the we're bringing out a new
autumn winter collection
working son
we've been working so so hard
and this
it's frustrating because I can't
and you can't see anything until it is
already it takes months of
everything stuff goes wrong and I don't
know if it's gonna work out
Oh anyway he will be unveiled and
be unveiled in the box pop pop-up shop
when we go there
I got well probably do a whole video
just talking about the box
when everybody kind of mentioned a
little bit so far
yeah we're so excited
and all the hard stuff or still be
if you want to come and see things in
touch them touch them up
if you don't want Barney then just come
in and say hello see some people it's
quite late now and Sam's up in bed she
doesn't feel very much so she feels real
so I'm just puttin stuff away now I
don't know where the doctor
I'll bet Riley's sleep you're not there
which means I'm gonna have to go and try
not to wait that hover and that means
bad but Franklin's down you come to bed
go to bed come on then
good boy I've just been watching the me
she lacks phlox if you don't know who
they are going check them out there
their looks are really enjoyable I know
I never watch anyone on YouTube to be
honest it's not really my kind of thing
but I do watch the me she likes Lois
because they're really nice to watch
they put me in a good mood so go check
them out I think that's probably it for
today at out Sam's end it because she's
probably asleep so good night and we'll
probably see you tomorrow
