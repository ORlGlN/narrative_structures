booked in he'd planned to meet a friend
today so he's gone out just for a little
bit and then later I think they were
good until a little bit later I won't go
to the cinema today but there's not a
lot on like there's a lot of really
crappy films I don't know what to do or
whether to just stay and get some
Chinese food and like watch something
here but anyway he's gone outside I used
to take rails to his looks so I'm
thinking - I usually like you know walk
him around where we live but I'm
thinking to go to an area like hamster
or something I might go there I'm gonna
take him in the car put his little um
car harness on and taking four so I feel
like going somewhere different as well
and yeah so that's that much put a
picture up and it's a green um and yeah
the zoo happens boom hey but walking in
hamster yeah

Riley's chewing his bone and I'm gonna
watch YouTube videos they can reply to
comments and stuff thank you guys so
much for the comments on my three
outfits three days do I I love it when
there's just such positive you know like
such good feedback and I want to do more
videos like that where it ties in like
makeup and style with kind of the
everyday and just
what I do myself I'm just being me but
yeah anyway I'm gonna go this is a
really long ramble this is this this is
me really tired also I totally forgot um
I forgot just melt eventually when I
plug just now I was like oh this is what
I'm going to talk about surround boiling
the kettle myself but right burger on
burger I'm gonna talk about burgers so
we were I went to Shake Shack the other
day there was so much hype about Shake
Shack and which is so I think it's
American it's not around America and
it's like a fast food chain with good
burgers what probably is good over there
but there's one in Covent Garden in
London and so I went because there was
so much talk about Shake Shack and it
being amazing it was like one of the
worst burgers in maybe a year like you
know when you get a really bad
McDonald's or Burger King it was kind of
like that like it wasn't very good the
chips when I suppose they had the cheese
sauce on it and stuff but really not
good and then apparently the bacon one
wasn't good as well and but a lot of
people saying that there when they've
had it it's been amazing so maybe I just
got a one-off but I personally wouldn't
go running back to Shake Shack and
that's my little review got to
counteract their I then tried dirty
burger and oh my god it was so good the
meat was so like juicy and fresh and I
don't know people get funny enough to
talk about me because I used to be
pescetarian but you know personal choice
I'm not telling anyone else to change or
anyone else to eat me it's just me but
um yeah dirty burger was amazing I'm
sure their veggies selection as well is
good oh the cheese oh my god the onion
fries like some of the best onion rings
I've ever had could see my eyes like
they get white looks like this so yeah
thirsty burger amazing Shake Shack mmm
one out of five for Shake Shack dirty
burger 4.5 out of 5 man
