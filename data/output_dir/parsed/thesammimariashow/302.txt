Rhianna Johnson
it's a PITA
you know what is incredible mark in my
career and great on that the fact that
Southern University has recognized my
work and commitment and progression at
maker is not what is very supportive and
very inspirational standing here today I
have to thank having faith in my own
beliefs and listening to my heart and
trusting my instincts especially when I
was down I would sound like my amazing
parents that they constantly brought in
growth of understanding and respect for
what I do
it's difficult learning a new look just
building on a main member partner
sharing my life and accepting of grace
what ever come into it I'd like to end
with two quotes for other words because
I feel what all students is blind the
only way finding the limits of the
possible is by going through and beyond
them into the impossible and also for
the students where you will have sat
down today I was empty and understood in
fortune favors the brave and believe
with all your heart that you will do
what we were made to do thank you
okay hi everyone so it's after the
graduation and I got this silly hat on
it's okay I like my angles yeah so I'm
really it was good but I'm tired and
hungry and now I gotta go and take the
gown back which looks like this which
looks like this is my dress it's from
Topshop

heart oh my god I've got my necklace
