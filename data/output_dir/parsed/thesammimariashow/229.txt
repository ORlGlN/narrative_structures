the Great Barrier Reef
well it's largest of its five stretches
for over 2,000 kilometers very well
managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine
Park Authority and its future it's in
the hands of good people we think I
think it's got a opening up very diverse
futures about some tariffs there it
generates a bit father was 1 million
dollars a year to the Queensland quantum
is employs about 50 there's lots of
things that we can do just just and it's
about literally 50 just would expect now

page might be mental boxing the
rainforest and be everything interests
about air quality in spare what you use
in your house and severe what you
or recycle with the same thing to the
prior to the world some of the very
proactive our schools are very very much
risk reinforcing
