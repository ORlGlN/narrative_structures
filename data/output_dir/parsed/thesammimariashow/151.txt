hey guys it's Tuesday and today I know I
said yesterday that I was going to
London we're actually gonna go to
Brighton today which is really exciting
and it's about ten o'clock for supposed
to be leaving now yep so we're going to
buy some or bring in the dogs with us
which should be a little so it'll be a
really nice last balloon day it should
be and it's supposed to be like 27
degrees today which is mental to UK are
you ready boys
got myself a nice coffee yeah mmm I
think we're here to stop the plane
I just made it to Brighton and the world
I just got back from the seance so it's
you and watching that all just come in
and it's so much you guys thing about
how you've been like setting alarms to
get up for you know when it goes back up
and stuff so it is really exciting
when I was saying senator I want to
provide that's like sending along abroad
I wanted like say don't worry I'll hold
you because there's three minds
it's like amazingly clear sky is it it's
really hot and the Ducks are doing quite
well this time last time tracking pay me
the colleagues prying Riley's really
chilled
so just been walking around I believe
without the lanes met subscriber and
we're gonna just sit down soon have
something to drink
who's me to eat it's so nice
I think I just got home
bloody knuckles from the journey and
everything in the day because it's kind
of stressful when you've got the dogs
with you and everything but it was
really good it was really nice to go to
a different area and just you know have
a walk around a different town and stuff
or city town city I'm just gonna jump in
the shower because I just felt like I
was running around in the sea and stuff
and I just feel a bit gross
so yeah that's me and then pretty view
making dinner and stuff so it's only
that this is the last day it doesn't
feel like it's actually the last day of
loom but anyway I'll catch up with you
guys after I freshened up come out the
shower I'm uploading yesterday's vlog
and we're just making dinner
my top tips I get out of ring attire
yes so dinner is just something like
okay I can't
the whole effect is so with being well
we just feel like being healthy fish so
chicken bacon I mean are you having a
little bit bacon and then we're both
having like a little salad with avocado
spring onion these hey Franklin Franklin
it's a nice day Oh bloom
how do you feel it's the last day okay
just walk away how do you feel about it
being the last day of lunar Isles
you got anything to add get that bloody
camera out my face mother hey riles it's
the last day I bet your neck he's been
he was like floundering around in the
sea I don't know Jason got the shot or
not that he was soaked it was like a
dolphin in the water it was his first
time did I say it was the first time
probably I washed my hair that's I just
want to just want to say how nice it was
in Bryce instead I really want to go
back though so kind of we didn't get to
go in any of the little shops and you
know that are all independent stores
that look really nice and stuff because
we had the dogs on us and it was quite
it was kind of busy but it was just a
bit manic you know like in general and
when you've got the dogs of you it's a
bit stressful and they overheat really
easily especially with that breed and it
was about 27 degrees today so we were
you know we don't want to hang out keep
making them hang around in the Sun too
much apart from when they were on the
beach without only shade and I really
want to go back I really like it in
Brighton it's three-hit I've just loved
the vibe it's kind of hippy and really
it's trendy and hippie and just nice so
I just want to say as well the in case I
don't get to say this because it's the
evening and you know what we're like in
the evening with tenser it's just
rolling over for me rob is belly

late and I probably won't have the
energy to say this later but thank you
