good morning it's welcome stay to a
little bit of a moody one this morning
she's had her breakfast but she wants
her milk I think she's a bit tired I
thought this was that would actually
distract her a bit which it is
yeah it's beautycon day I'm a bit
nervous little bit anxious it's just
that thing of not knowing how it's gonna
go and if there's gonna be if I'm gonna
mess up no Andy just finishing her
bottle I could just got this delivery oh
my god I'm so excited I've seen so many
people mention this brand look oh my god
I love the packaging I can't wait to try
these bits I might try them this morning
I just put a bit on my hat like just
weaved about and it smells so nice I
can't wait to use this yeah thank you
let me have it
make you some porridge um because it's
quick and I've gotta suck it and ready
in a minute I'm always like this before
things I hate they're so annoying
I really want to try hit my therapy for
like social anxiety so if I start that
this month as well I let I try let you
know how it goes I need to book a
session in I've been putting it off like
this so down there is the main bit
and up here it's all nice and chilled
out and everything
yeah and then I'm just waiting with
finding out when my panelists
I'm Maria and one of the cheaper I talk
about fashion yourself easy lifestyle
everything excited about
okay next up we have all along
like always
beginning is the
the response for everyone
I think that's reading only to the
governments like sharing things about my
life
anyway spectrum and also I think this
really nice that little YouTube you can
be that place of people can come to
probably
you can see like anything has a really
bad day I know it sounds cheesy but you
can dismiss it your channel and you can
like having a kind of having the chats
there when your channel might happen and
laugh about things will take in life to
see
because retreat
in each episode
people
YouTube TV
you see going and how much cheating you
that's a question that way
I think it was still okay not to cry but
if you've been watching for a while
you've seen that it's it's really
changed over the years
tonight
are you to get involved with a different
project
something like YouTube
dai gzdoom it like 20 years something
you kind of I think might but also as
long as
it's to my enjoyment but yet it's making
about enjoying it and also continuing it
tell me Michael sensor that it's
something I really enjoy doing something
although inequalities
current trends different
the unequal aw cheap as well
obviously but yet in Sweden
- courtship we go
any other
click my channel and it went really well
I think I think I feel like I messed up
a bit at the beginning and I was I got
so nervous smells like voice there I
think I was like yes
put a click fist up and then what
everyone else is talking I was like ok
the next one I need to answer it
properly but it's always a bit
nerve-racking when you can hear your
voice solos and it's really distracting
and I'm not you've swept back yeah I
think overall it went fine
good - I could have galloped my
phone but yeah I think I'm gonna head
back to enterprise myself a little bit
of cake for the car
taras let me some people here behind me
as well
and Petrelli Jenna's friends Jordan
gorgeous
now inhale
Oh crushed so I'm back home and we're
now we're doing the tree which is really
exciting so indeed first time doing it
yeah
it's going really well we really really
loved the tree cuz I was a little bit
worried in case it would be a little bit
too blue toned or something but I think
because I was the a blaze of lights in
it in the store and it's more pretty but
it's so nice I think I'm pretty sure
everyone goes yeah and we've got these
monocled little shaggy rug things from
Ikea yeah because we weren't there the
other day yeah so hoping all our
decorations look good on it as well
yeah we're definitely not look this bad
we got the right ones because I thought
yeah what do you think Indy the first
one on yes yes well done parents so here
we've got a bag of decorations we've got
um bubbles so yeah bubbles and and then
we've got a set of bubbles as well
I love today's thank you they look like
Liberty st. hmm on the tree let's say Oh
read it
thank you she receiving giggles her
shake down easy
whoo oh they look really nice they so
annoying it yeah they're brilliant but
we do need more huh it's a few hours
later now so we didn't actually finish
doing the whole of the tree but we've
obviously done what you guys have seen
and we put some lights on it but we kind
of had to pause because the lights that
we've got there's they're really really
nice but they don't cover much of the
tree so they tomorrow I'm gonna go and
have to find some kind of dainty er
lights that have more of them I put
indeed to bed and we ordered a bit of
food again I know it's pretty bad but
we've got gbk and oh I was gonna have a
little chat about kind of powers feeling
today because I felt a bit kind of
anxious and then a bit down like when I
got back but not really like I had such
an amazing time at beautycon
but I mean relating to myself and how I
thought I did and everything so maybe
I'll have a little chat about that after
dinner I've just been having a bit of a
tidy up at the house
I love tidying up the house I don't know
if that's really sad but I get so much
joy out of like puttering around and
that I like sorting everything up look
at this last night I went a bit crazy
and I or I did a huge a sauce order I
don't think I've ever had a package this
big so I'm definitely gonna do a whole
video this video should be up next
Wednesday so keep an eye out for that
one or food just arrived I shouldn't put
it on the floor it's all greasy I got
that aparcado bacon burger and I've got
sweet potato fries these are Jason's
fries they're really good I'm stealing
some he's not gonna notice until you
watch this look back
he's mine yes oh my god he got cheesy
chips oh my god are these their truffle
eat chips Oh stealing some of these just
making us some tea we tend to like
having tea at night even though I know
it's got caffeine in it it doesn't
affect me at all
hey guys I'm just on our bed and I think
I'm gonna go to bed soon but I wanted to
have a little chat at the end of this
vlog and kind of explain how I was
feeling earlier in everything I thought
I don't really want to make it a whole
social anxiety spiel but basically I was
kind of like fine about doing the panel
and everything but on the days leading
up to it and I think it's just like just
before the panels like it really I did
get really nervous and like well it's
probably normal but well maybe not so
everyone but like my heart starts
beating really fast and I start being
like oh my god what if it I didn't know
you're like what if something goes wrong
what if I do something wrong and I
obviously try and tell myself like I
should be in City it's gonna be fine
but I think sometimes when I'm on
especially if I've just come on the
panel and there's quite a big audience
and there was a quite big audience today
and sometimes like if I'm asked
something on a panel um I just kind of
get I it's almost like I kind of freeze
up I freeze up and then also I have a
voice in my head like that makes me
super aware of myself and how I'm not
speaking properly and then it's kind of
like a vicious cycle because I'll feel
that and then it will make me not speak
properly more if that makes sense
so I've probably already put the footage
in but the first bit were I think the
first question that I answer I just
totally messed up I was just like yeah
the response from everyone yeah no I I
wanted to say so much more than that
the first rating thing about so town's
idea is that um you're not it like when
I feel like it around people I'm not
totally myself I'm really
Whittle down version of myself and why I
say and do and it's a straight thing
because I I just wish I could have been
so much more articulate and I could have
spoke for longer so yeah I don't know
why this is getting longer than I
thought but I kind of freaked out a bit
in my head after the first question that
went round for everyone but because of
that when I was on the panel I was like
okay you read like next question answer
it better like try to ignore all the try
to ignore your negative feelings and
just try and focus on the question
because it's so distracting when you can
hear your voice on the speakers it just
makes it a bit more difficult when you
can't it's not like you're in a normal
conversation and you're just talking and
so yeah I just kept trying and trying
each time the mic you know each time the
questions came to me I tried to relax a
little bit and and just communicate a
bit better and I feel like I really did
like towards the end I could have been
on there for longer because I felt after
like 15 10 15 minutes I actually felt
quite comfortable up there I think what
I'm trying to say is after like when I
left right in the car on the way back
and I do this sometimes I was just like
replaying and replaying where I feel
like I went wrong and then it was making
me feel really bad about myself and like
I don't often get like that but when I
when I feel like I've been really
awkward I really could have beat myself
up about it
I really really want to sort this out
and hopefully this month I actually
might start a some sort of therapy for
it
like I said earlier in the vlog actually
but also that's why I haven't been super
chassis on the vlog today since I got
back because I got back and I just
needed a bit of a breather from
everything I came into our bedroom and
just actually laid down for a minute and
I just had to breathe to try and feel
normal again
I've been trying to be quite kind to
myself and like taking taking it easy on
myself you know and just chilling out a
bit so anyway thank you so much
beautycon for having
it was it's always amazing to get to
speak on panels and like share share my
views sometimes they don't come out but
but also it just helps me with my
confidence as well each time it like
builds builds it up a bit
tomorrow hopefully we'll finish the
Christmas tree and we've got a Sunday
tomorrow so nice family day hopefully
I'm going to sign off thank you guys for
watching and I'm gonna might go have a
bath or a shower put a face mask on and
just sleep just sleep I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye
