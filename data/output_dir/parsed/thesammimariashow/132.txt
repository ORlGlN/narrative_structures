because it's Monday
the suitcase up the stairs I'm at
Piccadilly Circus and I've got a meeting
at Dean Street townhouse which I really
like I've only been there once before
but I'm really excited to have breakfast
there then I've got a really exciting
shoe and it's gonna be with Free People
so I can't wait for it because three
people are one of my favorite favorite
brands ever so the dress I'm wearing
which I can't really see but is a free
people dress and I've got some more
clothes in it my suitcase Bill Murray's
dick paste as well and I didn't have
enough time this morning to do my makeup
so I've got a quickly shoving to make up
for this meeting
should be a good warning and then later
I'm going to head home and do as ting
the usual
do my god is such a nice Monday I had XY
hours
I definitely recommend the street
townhouse if he ever will
and you wouldn't breakfast in London
so now I think I'm about like almost an
hour to kill before the shoot and I'm
really excited for it like 10 percent
nervous but it should be fine hi I might
just find somewhere to go and sit and
read my book or something you know
so I just finished my shoot with three
people it went really well I love this
outfit that I'm wearing
kind of put it together quickly last
night and thought it would work and then
I really liked it so they're gonna let
me they're gonna only be able to share
the photos with you guys as well it's
just so cool I cannot wait

people

omelette never done it before make it

heavy meal so that's smart dinner and I
put cheese on top
