of a shower okay eat first and then we
see how time is okay no shower no no
time film outside they look so angry
so no time for shower huh No we ran out

trying to get you guys go so we wouldn't
have to run so do we have to run I don't

strange like I've been flying for 24
hours
yeah this is the last flight for today
who knows what we'll book tonight Jonny

to proceed against a 2010 I approve of
the flip-flop mess oh it is so nice it's
like cause it feels nice Phil we're
chilling
and we have touchdown oh yeah we could
upgrade our place in it we could upgrade
to tax in a heli ah great okay so the
only thing we need to do is take the
heli to Monaco export the video blog
upload it and then we can die that's
what it's for 20 minutes
yeah stuff yeah that's true how my new
video blog shoot I'm not gonna be in the
next day Johnny's gone so yeah this is
life isn't any longer you walk up to

at hell er Monaco perfect Oh
yeah we got all the bags Yanni's real
happy I like don't care and you kind of
like want to lose you
yeah they like tipped up dude
so bit of a fun fact near Monaco is that
the Hawker 130 euros per person but if
you're alone let's count the loan prices
so a helicopter needs to monitor with
130 the taxis are usually a hundred 110
so it's kind of great that the heli in
almost the same price car thank you
I think this might be the last leg of
our trip I'm excited to get home yeah no
I'm gonna stay
it just never gets old
knowing the helicopter it's six minutes
from the airport it's pretty nice I'm
not gonna lie especially when you've
been traveling for 24 hours yeah oh nice
final leg yeah that was the best leg of
the trip better than that thirteen
thousand year old afraid possibility yes
fifteen thousand

that's okay really good go got enough
chili though but I know you guys don't
like chili so maybe that's a good thing
you know what I just realized
no we have not finished off today's
video I figured that maybe you want to
finish it off today but before we do we
gotta take up today's question so we
don't forget okay
and since since there was about nine
gazillion comments on why the video was
in 60 frames per second and it seems
like half the people hate it have two
people love it and the I thought we
should bring it up why it wasn't 60
today okay so today's video blog was in
60fps because I suck so you don't like
it no we hate 60 frames and we will
never use it again but after 36 hours
without sleep and 20
hours on an airplane and editing I stop
and I hate myself now admitted it you
just like sixty frames per second
secretly you think so
no actually I don't yeah who the
cares like it since two frames thirty
face who cares we like it better in
thirty yeah yeah we do in twenty four to
be honest
2424 so enjoy it for those who like it
and for those who don't 24 tomorrow yeah
then we will see you guys tomorrow we
will how do you say goodbye a French
where a bar our reward
ciao
