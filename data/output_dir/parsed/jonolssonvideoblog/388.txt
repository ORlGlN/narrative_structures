incredible for you barefoot barefoot our
lives no it's not allowed see you guys

thank you
let's run
clock in the car was wrong so we have 33
minutes
no problem have a stop for tea or nuts
or scissors there is no science anywhere
there's no people and personnel and
there's no people at our gate I don't
know if I have my phone it's a big
question mark on that one thank you
thank you that was pretty lucky that
that flexplate yeah that was about
latest I've ever been I know you think
it's just super the great Turner it's
just a quick airport I don't want to be
me neither
I'm so sad this is true there was the
trip of a lifetime I'm gonna say it's
best 3 - shut up for us amazing people
like the mint people ever simply
incredible for now let me jump on this
bad boy and play back the body
oh my god is hot this was the only clean
shirt I had found him
but it's so much warmer here than where
we came from it is it's weird super work
but who are we to complain about swarm
yeah about heat and we're back
Ike oh my god yes to our favorite place
yeah that really feels like we're coming
home
yes yeah I want to chill today neato
every day when you start the day with an
early flight you always have that weird
lack of energy oh yeah we're doing today
we're going to organic your face and
they have a hamburger for you Marcus do
we trust her
nope you think you can do it this is
tricky look here it's not really roller
bag optimized but Marcus found a good
way to get the bag in and I have my
laptop in there but I got total trust in
Marcus yep
when egg yeah high-five
I was professional I loved it
what's up with the rain I don't know
what are you doing Bali when it's
raining I don't know me neither
well I guess we've seen enough Sun for
the last week or so yeah that's true
so let's do today's comment instead it's
kind of perfect is we're not really
doing anything else okay you have
anything good um yeah I got one actually
what'd you think about Casey Neistat
taking a break um what do I think good
case and I still taking a break from
daily vlogging I am surprised that so
Casey Neistat has done daily vlogs for
500 something days yeah yeah I think so
which is crazy so the fact that he
hasn't taken a break or quit before is
just insane so I think he's been a
champion and not just pushed through
four five hundred and something days
because I mean when you do daily vlogs
you have ups and downs and I mean at
least me and Marcus we're two so we can
motivate motivate each other but Casey's
alone and it's always on him so the fact
that he's done but it's done it's
incredible and I think it deserves a
break and I'm sure that once you take a
break he's gonna come back and make even
better video stuff than before let's
hope so if it's possible yeah no it's
cool it's always fun to watch but it's a
good question today cuz yesterday I was
starting to feel a bit feverish so I've
really been like feeling weird and a
couple hours ago Marcus like I'm kind of
feeling feverish as well and that's kind
of like in a daily vlog that you have
your epic case and then you have your
days that are not as exciting and I
guess today it's raining and we are
feeling feverish and yeah it's not one
of those super epic days team overkill
not killing it not while we're still
killing every we're having an awesome
time in Bali but activity-wise no not
killing it but I know one thing we can
do yeah we can go eat a magic burger
Johnny wants a place called C circus why
do you always have the solution for
everything with food because food is
always good
I know that me and honey went there one
night alone and that was the place I
know Marcus would have loved Oh perfect
today so I say we maybe take a shower
and then go out some dinner yeah just
walk out in the rain
that's warmups okay Cheers
feta cheese
and again
- chicken taco - spicy taco porous yet
for one french fry and a bear nested
you think maybe we overdid it a little
this should be enough right
your waitress told me I think that is
too much for you just wait and see but
it looks damn good so how did it go
they can be pretty good
done good I think we killed it
get off our team but now I feel like
something else I feel like an animal
that been bit by a komodo dragon which
means that it can usually walk for a bit
and then it dies we're going to walk
over and I watch a movie watch a movie
and call it a day
yes Christian Bale always okay see you
guys tomorrow
something jumbo sopra fresh tomorrow
yeah some fight your fuck did you hear
that
yeah Cho ha ha some pipe you fuck
