so you found them there what the
sunglasses yeah no these I thought I
lost them no I saw this more like I'll
look in here or in a backpack oh you're
gonna luck buddy please close the door
okay so what's up it's morning and it's
our second last morning here in Bali so
we figure that we're going to continue
with the adventure stuff I've been to
Bali 11 times but I've yet to go to
waterfall so that is submission of today
yes let's go see if we can find one you
gotta put your past behind you look it
bad things happen and you can't do
anything about right strong when the
world turns it back on you are you
excited for this on it yeah I love
waterfalls excuse me which way to the
waterfall hey what the I'm on that
quick yeah totally okay I'm so glad we
got up early and that's the key to
everything get up early just go places
before everyone comes
I love jungle place is cool we thought
we'd have to travel far in Bali to see
the cool waterfalls this is awesome at
the jungle and water for everything so
cool
that's the motto of today don't worry be
sexy but not make it yeah
the water
I'm glad I can't jump
have been my job I have to do stuff no
I'm gonna go get him soft
I'm not much on top
it means no worries that looks like a
small waterfall nothing powerful I don't
like I mean like it
you got to put that thing in and out of
water let's do it
Oh
hm
Oh dance by Johnny one of the apps and
one of the four yeah not good is it
dangerous hope not yeah like Raymond dr.
Gondo
either way this was really cool I
totally want thumbs up from us I can put
some lotion on the outside
you can't stop with a photo can you
stand here in Bali looking at a
waterfall if you've seen nothing funny
yeah but I'm going to go ahead and
really recommend this because I've been
in Bali a lot and I always thought the
waterfalls were in far away but this
place if you go early we arrive what at
9:00 yeah pretty much alone so the whole
key to this place we get earth get here
early if you do it's really sick
all right mission accomplished let's
find a new one
I am so starving that Jimmy Ellis eat it
standing up we are at organic cafe
it was Marcus idea totally my idea now
but I think it's going to be really good
actually have some pictures for me I
hope to have like green pancakes and
stuff
we're stuck in traffic for not good and
I like barley traffic we gotta go in the
morning or at night I don't like any
traffic but Bali is the worst
approved by onyx
what
that is probably the prettiest filled of
every tab
you guys seen that Instagram husband
video
no we should link it up here it's really
funny is it a YouTube video theater
video sometimes if you like an Instagram
you are an Instagram husband true but
she's a YouTube
why so if he puts itself down yeah
we look at it it's good even when it's
empty it looks good when it's out
a picture loss or dummy
now I want my lay by the floor you and
kamudu Olsen oh oh so just walked out
the door on a bit of a solo mission here
I'm about to jump on a bike with a
friend of ours and go see a back
specialist at all renowned specialist
here in Bali so I'm gonna go and see if
he can help me out and figure out what
to do for my back to get better
now that was a way better eye than I
would have gotten in a car very from
Sweden
thank you so much thank you for the help
thank you so much
oh hello I'm in the living room where
are you oh hey always ready yeah how was
it you always don't want to come it
yeah it was great it was have to see now
I got to see all of Goethe our Tryon C
is so many years and I had needles in my
back and electricity my body was going
like this and it's hard to tell whether
it's gonna be epic in the future but I
think it's by far the best treatment
I'll have and probably tomorrow see how
I feel good but generally fantastic yeah
that's that's good to hear I don't have
two hours two hours with the stabilizer
and like a Q riding on the motorbike and
just check it out city the treatment was
like a bonus yeah that's a good thing
good I got these hot patches to put on
my back so just super nice yes and the
craziest thing is the same guy treated
candide thovex ah like the two skier
like I used to ski with candy 15 years
ago one tiny place has treated both of
us in Indonesia so cool crazy yeah but
with that we've had a long day so I'd
say we do a little some bite Yuba and we
see you guys tomorrow
