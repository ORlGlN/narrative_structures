good morning good morning I think it's
time to you know see what the definition
of ski-in ski-out is so I'm going to
just walk out here and see what your
pants got Japan has some powder for us
ok I'm going skiing oh okay
we found snow this is what we go to
Japan
what am I on our roof no okay I'll go
get lipstick it yeah we'll see now that
alright this is the ticket to powder ski
define if you haven't ski powder in
Japan you haven't ski powder okay I'm
excited like it like this is since
yesterday and they said it in snow last
night it's change that's good there's a
reason why we jump on a flight and go to
Japan so what do we do now
I don't know you know what do I know
we'll just follow something okay I have
never been here before I have nowhere to
go
or no idea where to go and I'm just
gonna follow you so that's a great plan
I'm really I'm a great guy to follow Oh
hardcore goatees diner powder oh my god
is it fun I can hardly take it down too
much so
rock'n'roll Japan
whoa the out mark is still alive he's
killing it out here oh hold on look at
your photo
that's nice chairlift yeah there's like
safety bar nope okay it's clearing up
maybe then we can figure out where to go
we're like Lucero keys were like oh
let's take that lift or than the where
that trailer goes just the beauty about
Japan that there's not many people that
go and ski off piste nope like this
anywhere else would have been so tracked
out by now and I feel like we could skip
out here for four days that's what I
like if there's tracks it's good to go
right yep whoo see where this takes us
I was getting suffocated Oh
have you done anything like that is
never I have not either old by God I
really cook breathes I like to do it
good good you know do you think we can
file a complaint somewhere that it's too
deep
look at this oh my god is it fun okay
this is top three deepest I've ever
skied is it yeah finally we were
starving winning the burger camera icon
finally food and drinks they're like
sorry only cash come on oh but now I
think I saw a bull and waffle
Walter nice you're going to eat him on
the list bill why yeah when you have
pound like that sitting down would be
like I can't think of anything else that
would be worse than sitting here and
eating like that would be like it'd be
worse having a fly on your I just got
cool oh yeah oh yeah
yes let's go now you see what powder can
be like there's a lot of different kinds
of smells but this is like yeah this is
a bad different now we're talking up yes
now for here's a waffle okay forget
about the Jeff screw the Frog and
those have a waffle
stop bugging I need to do some recon I'm
acting like an obsessed person there but
there's just there's so many different
areas you can ski not say a tree the
lens
because you're talking filming like look
at this powder we should have brought
the snorkel we I got I want to find this
nor do I want that photo oh my god the
game on whoa that is easy
before waffles but we got to eat
something otherwise we're not going to
be able to last this long because we're
burning about a waffle for half a row it
hurts my soul when I want to walk
straight to the lips in the nightlife
it's like spend six minutes here I can
feel that we were on an airplane all day
yesterday me too like no sleep and then
no food just pop up but oh my god is
this is why we looked at web weather
maps around the world and wall never go
here nothing compares to Japan okay I'm
going to go out on a limb here and say
that this has potential to be the best
powder tree here on of my life all right
well let's see what you got Japan you
are looking real promising right here
you ready for this I am let's do it
oh my god Grady's are so insane we need
a snorkel I couldn't breathe
holy mother of sow gods let's go let's
go what happened I love about this card
huh
I lost my lip we need to go you lost
your ticket yep and it's coming for you
really yeah well let's go see them
before they come take my pass
he talked to you I've seen a lot of my
day but I have to say hands down not
vulgar talk this is the deepest note I
have ever skied so what do we do you
know what do we do now hmm
you got your kid take it complicated yes
I am so good yes I'm good so you can pee
okay I'm gonna go and if I can get up
I'm gonna keep skiing because it's just
awesome even though we don't have any
batteries nope so maybe I'll have some
film maybe not I'll see you at home
yes and now a little bit of cat and
mouse at ski patrol never hurts so let's
go see if I can get up there yep
all right either way I'll see you at
home but be it a bet whew
Oh
oh pretty glad but I didn't take my
ticket cuz we got some epic runs can I
remember last time I skied more than
eight hours that kind of shows how good
today was well no hole lovers yeah eight
and a half hours later yeah I couldn't
stop I saw that that was great I just
wish we had we got to get more GoPro
batteries and I didn't take my ticket
yeah well like I saw them looking at me
I'm like I was about to pull it out but
mmm I think they saw that you needed a
rush when they sent you home I really
want to have this ski-in ski-out like
ski to this living room
you can't have snow in the living room
so I have a plan for tomorrow again
apparently Cortina which is apparently a
good ski resort has been closed today
because it was too much snow so they
open up tomorrow how about we end
today's vlog here so that we can edit it
really early and actually get some sleep
tonight yeah so that we have a ton of
energy tomorrow because I can feel that
my energy after eight and a half hours
on the hill it's like really little
we still haven't learnt any Japanese so
we'll go with Swedish tradition the
harsh reward we are up Vilas Vespa to
the door of the house roof leak thunder
so new scary Silva the host reborn how
does it go we'll see you guys tomorrow
ciao
