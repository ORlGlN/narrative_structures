time is it now 10:50 only too many 20
minutes played 46 20 minutes with the
shower and everything okay let's jump it
uh like heart actually I'll spin to the
airport okay oh the last night I got a
photo from a friend
you said you should come to them that's
in Italy so instead of flying to Norway
today like we planned
me and Benny we're fine to Monaco - then
drive through Austria and you're flying
to Norway for commercials the more
important was it blue but you got a road
because I got a overall like he's
boarding time is 11:50 and it's 11:50 a
is that you see you don't have anything
up you don't have a carry-on no because
he's all good for you will see a small
good luck you know yes that's kind of
like why we've been stressing today
because we changed the destination
people's wills no like always trying to
find the best place to go even if it's
like really last-minute huh okay so the
photo that was the 9/9 the event and a
body of mine Nico Ron said he always
invites me and I can never come this
year weather forecast looking perfect
jumps looking crazy so I think our plan
is now awesome even though it's just a
really new plan yeah just some train
outside
what-mon we were just informed by slips
that we have Bureau luggage on our
tickets leave them with the Platinum the
highest your bonus card you can have and
then we have zero luggage up to payroll
for luggage use your your loyal customer
for 20 years the star lines and you get
zero luggage when you buy card then
what's the point of a point system these
are not cheap tickets no no none of
those really sticks with you yeah the
nougat yes
we got tickets are for last with stick
at least for me but um yeah our review
so far Swiss if you want to travel with
luggage should not go with sweat I think
most people kind of like likes luggage
as you said we do airline reviews
that's which review it
give me my house okay yeah una
no okay sorry
don't forget nice okay good thank you
Oh cookie please like now we just met a
lady who was like awesome huh she's like
really understanding and like you know
like a normal awesome person and I like
to do that so easy
hmm like now I almost want applies once
again but now that's the end of it
I think we're talking about mentality of
mr. color decided not to me
apparently they're tears of that which
open away or large aquatic swine thank
you Manoj this would be 41
whoa manases current yes
quick little stoplight but it's like I
get now a lot of time because now it

mission mouth we need power like that's
a beautiful thing in an airport when you
have seats and power we don't have to
sit on the floor and a corner and
beautiful brand-new yeah review comes
not so far it's like a lounge but for
free we show us not to go to the lounge
so we can optimize the time where we
could charge the computers welcome to
blogeee life in 2017 come on
green green now I can show go to the
bathroom
okay nice turn to the right if you want
to go but we have the idea that we
should set a rule that we can never film
to five min a day so I say that we spin
our way to the French Riviera Oh
