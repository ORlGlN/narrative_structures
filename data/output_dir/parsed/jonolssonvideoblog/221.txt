Roland Roland then we're going to say
good morning good morning to a beautiful
day because today we just saw our skis
getting lifted up by that a star and
Bradley's about to come pick us up and
we are going to get Yanni heli skiing
for the first time in her life yeah that
is the goal today my goal is to be the
best teacher boyfriend teacher that the
world has ever seen

been the worst boyfriend in the history
of the world in terms of like coaching
surfing and skiing today that's all
going to change look what we have here
Olsen this thing is almost out of
battery too
yeah but we got multiple batteries oh
yeah
the reason I'm holding this is because
Andre Ellis said he would rather make a
kick-ass edit then come out and ski with
us awful that is commitment but I told
them not to worry you're going to do a
lot more of this so it's cool to see how
stoked you is on making those awesome
edits
Jonnie you ready but the nicest best day
of your life yes
noon you're going to crush the filming
up there what I'm sure going to try I've
been like minimizing the center okay

grate fresh temperatures are all good

lunch cabinets secure

full change
