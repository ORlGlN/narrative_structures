so good morning today we are saying good
morning at 6 13 in the morning and I am
riding the vol boards it's been raining
and stormy like crazy here in Monaco and
we are gonna go surfing and I have to
admit that when it's raining on the
ground and you're trying to vlog and
ride one of these things at the same
time try to organize the lighting tripod
makes vlogging dream difficult to like
figure everything out and not die at the
same time and then when I was gonna try
to come on I really don't want to go
fast don't spin but now I made it to the
train stations got to run up there catch
the 6:33 then I'm alive this thing was
so sketchy morning good morning I love
the fact that we are catching the train
and the storm and the rain to go surfing
exactly Jordan for the ones who haven't
met him yeah this thing was a death trap
in the ring the reason I took that was
because I was trying to call a cab I'm
like okay I'm gonna grab a cab I don't
have to run over here and then the cab
wouldn't pick up so that then I'm like I
can't make the train unless I got the
board alright we're gonna jump on the
train to go to calm meet up Benny there
and get her
Oh
Phillipa did i pronounce it right yeah
whoa
June I'll sketch it was to write this
thing in the morning with a tripod this
thing in the rain and was it raining
yeah this it was with super wet still
huh turns out it doesn't have thunder so
so we need to work out a rain ass fun
predicting all the yeah in your face but
I was too late side to grab the board in
order to make it how are you guys all
ready we all ready to serve how do you
like my light solution it's so smart
octane directed the light what's up like
night bog 2.0 that's Burt did you see
well no oh yeah peni okay okay okay
your boys ready for morning sir
not big enough more for the longboarder
so we're gonna do like last time we're
gonna head towards Monaco it's a good
thing we got up like risk my life on the
board took the train here and now we're
gonna have that way what do you say it's
big but big but it's big but but I
cannot lie can you hear me so what did
you say sorry big and bumpy good okay
we're gonna repeat with the lady on the
phone said there is 28 minutes
congestion on this one this traffic look
at this map I don't like this it's all
red to where we came from where we got
up at 5:30 the train here I'm
responsible of this everything too for
me to sleep a bit more it's what I need
some congestion in front of you I think
it's happening because they closed the
road next to the beach which is a good
sign no that means chaos yeah big
any road I've gone on this road once and
it's a tiny tiny tiny tiny yeah we don't
see that left
it's a hate lift sorry I said oh you hit
that tiny yeah that's why you didn't
want to take it with George the rolls
know exactly George does not like this
road yes if it's an hour's power in the
house later yeah god damn traffic thanks
Benny
there's waves rolling in that's for sure
oh it is kind of serious out there
we were looking for death there this is
that serious death
that's exciting that sorry no problem
the nicest music getting fired up
public parking right here you can at
least
I'd like to see someone catch away
I don't know if this wide-angle and
throws it but what's ever coming in
there
its massive even though you're not
looking at French Riviera
I look that was we might have to check
that shot for inappropriate material
uh-huh I'll have to blur it again
blending in on the French Riviera I just
want to get in the water I'm nervous
okay
stressing coming ready
the excitement is coming
I'm joining you in a second
I think we've been in the water for two
hours at least at least maybe more and I
battled for four ways and I rode for
ways did we did I write do I probably
like 20 and I got on the floor maybe
then I had a heart rate of like a
hundred and sixty fifty no 190 fifty
times it was it was intense but sick but
a lot of people turned out to be like
the pipeline of the Mediterranean but
now I'm hungry but I'm cold and I'm
thinking whether we might have time for
a night session yeah even in 108 for his
food
oh it smells food support Jenny you in
advance
hello it was big yes
like I I pedaled up and I set for an
hour before I try to win right it was
great but I'm so hungry now I've had a
bar just the bar and we've been away for
a while
let's eat some pasta like you know when
you're so hungry that you read it alike
leave the camera on the ground and like
ignore it because you just need food
that was me I was like actually almost
hangry really mm-hmm
say you're awake for eight hours and you
surf for more than two hours and you
don't need but it was supposed to be
morning session income not driving all
the way back to mom icon but soon life
is gonna be back to sunshine and
greatness greatness so the best thing to
do when you're really tired
it's just shift down hit full gas and go
even harder now wait we are once again
in another elevator all jammed up we're
gonna try to go give it one more go
because you never know when you get
waves next you know at least this way we
wake up we get a good exercise and we as
we said in the last log it's important
to like work out every day
today's a double work well well double
double it today yeah
tomorrow no no no no I'm popped like in
the couch and then we decided to go
surfing as I fire on that ready was all
about this is gonna suck a wet wet suit
is probably the worst feeling you can
have no wet wet suit and wet ski boots
when you do water amps oh that's all
this I've never tried everybody ready
y'all ready listen to some classical
music here in the car to get like the
Stoke factor up apparently that's the
French way tomorrow
so the main reason we decided to go for
a second serve was that the Sun was
coming out it's gonna be a beautiful
sunset and now it's getting dark
and it's raining it's like surfing in LA
okay so the Sun set is in like 55
minutes we got to be quick yeah but it's
it's already it's already kind of dark
so it doesn't really matter but when in
doubt go flat out help you Betty the
Vandal the rebel surfers thinking a
piston his pawn show on the street go go
go go go this is what we call putting in
an effort to have some fun and like
taking that little moment of uncomfort
in order to gain yeah I don't know what
we're gonna gain but I'm still stoked
it'll be a hell of a lot better than
being on the couch doing nothing Jordan
sink so he's making the smart call yeah
you turn the keys to a quick change is
to like do everything at the same time
bottle drops fucking barrels are getting
away from
and I'm ready
and the boogie board is still in here
that looks so much more pleasant and
enjoyable compared to a few hours ago
I think we're 50 euros ago I think
oh you go I'm so glad we went back out
although it's kind of dark now it was
kind of sketchy yeah
winning what a great session what a
great day yeah what a great day but now
I'm hungry again again so now I say that
we end today's vlog it's a short surf
vlog with a reminder that it's good to
do a lot of things stay active yeah I
don't have anything else to say I'm
tired and I'm hungry and that's it ah in
French wind honks ah and since we're an
ass in France on the vanilla vlogger
