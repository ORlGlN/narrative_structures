our way to rolls-royce sign a couple
papers and potentially drive the car out
of there it's not fixed or anything Phil

out of there so if papers are good we
might end up with a car which would be
real nice so I can catch my plane yes
like you under hasn't ride to the
airport
I almost forgot we haven't told you guys

video for about a week so yeah

what it looks like once you buy a car

need as we drive I mean I always want to
try to make gallery bike though

and not just move CCCP George
Priti conjure up
I think I was quite surprised about the
door that I was coming out the other
it's cool right yes people look at that
smile huh I think it's a good it's a
good car for us yeah don't look at it
look like it looks now it's but we're
completely different in how I would say
roughly three weeks everything surgery
done I've seen the growing some yeah
you've seen I'm really knows what's up
you see won't be able to tell that this
was the car but not much more than that
okay it was a pleasure it was a pleasure
do it through your first time a long
time ago so yeah and now I finally made
some business so summation today so it's
really happy for you I meet you I'm
really happy and that there would be a
comfortable car yeah you kid you I just
got to get some good music in there
okay so perfect then we're going Airport
so you are not late it's a good good two
days first time in business and for
maybe first time in roles have you seen
the stars in the roof what it is usual
for every old
oh yeah there's an option don't crash
the car now you
it's going so smoothly it's smooth but
then once you hit the gas it's fast yeah
test like 600 and something horsepower
wow that's a lot I it's kind of I wish
like we had wheeled by time so you could
push the car really I'm sure no one else
will will end up being in in a hurry
all right let's see how we can parallel
park this thing it's so good oh my god
money Oh bye-bye
I think that means for the plug yeah
truly I'm happy yeah I can see that yeah
but it's like every sports car they're
kind of similar but this is something so
completely different in history see I
never thought they would work out I
thought that no they'd be a problem with
some things and then we would have to
take a taxi back and like let me do koto
Faye there because that's what happens
