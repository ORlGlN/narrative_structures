you
good morning good morning Marcus we may
be we might have packed a little much
this is the luggage space we have yeah
we have some oil and tools
let's what's you're gonna fit all of
that yeah we need a lot of smaller bags
these big bags are not ideal okay
hugger 30 fits perfectly in the boot of
the Huracan perfect that was the
smallest of our work
now comes the bigger bags rule number
one of Lambo what skybox traveling is to
not have big bags have multiple small
bags yeah we did not follow that rule
nope we never follow rules
no you're just yeah biggest bag yes what
do you think I think it's totally fine
no problem at all until you try to close
it hmm okay slight problem then if our
bags are too big we need multiple small
bags or just unpack this I think this
bag is not coming with us okay bye bye
bye you so is this gonna fit then yes
this one well this one's really packed
to the max Marnie perfect okay so now we
know that this works yep pygar 60
approved 456 norske box yes
I need a pasta dough we have low those
are perfect st. Vincent Resort and
Casino bags so yeah we have ordered
smaller bags that is on their way yeah
so we kind of expected this to be be
difficult okay you have your stuff hold
it so nicely I don't wanna yeah don't
ruin it
no no tripod maybe you were right we
could have skipped that on this trip
it's incredible how much you can fit in
our ski box that's why you have a ski
box because if you didn't have a ski box
we could not be traveling with the Lambo
that was easy
yeah that wasn't even a challenge nope
see it's a daily driver useful part of
course let's talk about the plan for
today okay so the plan for today it's
funny me and Marcus yesterday were like
oh it's so nice to have a rest date
tomorrow we've got nothing to do and
then we're like wait we have to drive
five five hundred something kilometres
and I was up early working and then five
hundred kilometers in a car then we were
laughing about the fact that we call
that a rest day without a suroeste day
in our schedule yeah it's been crazy
lately but that's how we like it so now
we are gonna jump in this thing drag two
brigands in Austria on the border to
Switzerland for a head photo shoot
tomorrow yeah so the schedule today
drivin and relax I'm so excited me too
please yeah I loved Italian please
they're like they're coming up but just
smiling and like giving you the pub's
time
put some relaxed
it's really nice to just get in the car
and just chill
rest day
so here we are totally stopped on the
highway Markus breaking out the office
to try to upload today's video come on
power come on let's go how comfortable
with the Lambo as a workstation perfect
when you can't change things roll with
it but videos supposed to be online in
half an hour when this happens it makes
vlogging life difficult yeah
this was a rest day you know this is a
rest day and then we thought 3G was good
in Italy it's been horrible trying
upload for two hours
nothing let's get a gas station sit down
grab a bite but no but no not today
come on 4G I hope you're good yeah I
feel so bad when videos aren't online on
time I found a Wi-Fi on the phone run
run Forrest run
perfect workstation the exits 33 minutes
there we should sit for four minutes
if you fall house on Instagram if
opposed to straight we can usually get
an Instagram post online you have the
description below and then it's sold and
at least you'll know flavor huh yep
so that's all we can do now now I'm
going to post an Instagram picture
saying that we're sorry we're doing our
best for crying and then I'm gonna go
buy us some food like I'm so jealous of
your chair yeah look at us look at this
setup like this Bucci life is so good
in like the corner of the restaurant
yeah the only place in power you got
chocolates
I'm buying water for rest day treats yes
let's have a chocolate just try to relax
for a second yeah we should really try
to slow ourselves down a little
today there is a rest day you know it
was a resting on the internet like yeah
so let's go back to resting now that the
video is up in 46% we can go back to
rest okay
thanks without the space I'll cool out
the grid that was good successful
mission we have too much stuff you
we gotta get an assistant to help us out
they have super only super what's super
sense up yonder yeah that's without LED
what we like super Chaput usually have
different kinds of super now we have
vignette for sweat salon we have blog
uploaded we have gas what is the
vignette for Switzerland
you have to have a thicker toupee that
shows you paid to go on the road okay so
now we just need to get this one
not enough group today
alright should be this one yeah
finally arrived my back's a little stiff
mine too
yeah so comfortable yeah it's super
comfortable it's comfortable but it's
that yeah it's the perfect daily driver
or maybe we just flew and travelled a
bit much yes see that's the beauty when
you have a ski box on a car like this
that you can actually go road tripping
with it yes I don't understand how every
other Lambo Ferrari and supercar owner
has a car like this and not a ski box
yeah that's my point also well I don't
understand how they have so little
luggage so you can't use the car yeah
but when you have this like I seriously
can't imagine having a Lambo without a
ski box not like we could never travel
like this nope
but now we can just as this we can't
travel we have travels so I think we
should end today yes does that sound
like a plan yeah it's pitch black so
yeah a little pitch black we have the
iPhone light ever everything is good
everything is good we'll check back
tomorrow and we are in Austria now right
yep good the not good enough I'll be
there soon I'll feel soon
what does that mean let's see you later
yeah a leader says costia bye bye
