there but when you try uploading from
your phones from double phones and from
every Wi-Fi you can find and it's still
like that take roughly four hours upload
of all and it's difficult but with my
new self I am trying to learn that the
world is not going to end if it is a
couple hours late is it so you could
have actually walked a little slower and
walked with me thank you very much

have to find a new one not going to let
a little microphone bring me down

happens when you travel to the point
