the police is not look back I will be a
SS and follow the data or the demon ear
and a florist in the water ever since
the old rs6 got stolen and burnt I knew
that I had to build another one
and it's car revealing time I know I've
been teasing a little bit that something
was happening I know I gave it a little
tease away with the wheels and Daniel
come that we're finally here
you know now instead of looking at
formula e wheels that are sick we can
look at this up or six with the most
epic wheels in the world by far by far
do you like it this is for sure the best
one up or - no I'm not happy like I'm
probably the most critical guy you can
think I'm like trying to find things I
don't like and yeah I've been here for
like four hours but I can't find
anything at all yeah
and then we have split cameras yeah
where is this from I saw rendering of
horas six wagon DTM and it was wiped
since there was one in our white r6 but
I also love a black or a six so that's
how the split came to be did you want to
fire her up
come back here that is the way a car is
supposed to sound we're doing double
filming here we have McDaniel is also
vlogging so cameras everywhere
but I'd say we jump in and go test her
out yeah
I'm good as that self that's terribly
good that might be the craziest sounding
car I'll pick you up in a sec buddy yes
in Florida the job description to
experience full gas accelerations
Jesus Christ
I love the fact that you're a
professional driver so I can just sit
there enjoy and worry 0%
okay this sounds more than the old one
there's no doubt in my mind anyone
really
you have four-wheel drive you can put
everything in the back for seeds no
other recent Babbitt appeals I have no
idea why I sold the older horses
we're Demonica no time
is this how up takes their clothes for a
first ride check it out I'm just gonna
slowly get up sideways my next life I'm
gonna be a real driver
are you ready
see they did the passenger seat is
sometimes awesome cuz I'll just sit
there like
Oh sick
do you think that'll be on a cake vlog
touring-car what did you see my ears I I
cannot hear anymore I was behind the car
look I think we should swap yeah okay
like I need to see if you can't bring
that thing to Monaco
challenge accepted I mean Who am I to
say no to driving my own car
you want to check it from the outside
then I jump in your truck
yeah time for Ortega to experience the
ready yes man I miss this car
I'm really glad I went to that formula
you know and otherwise we would not be
standing here with this car great I hope
you enjoy it's a lot of fun with this
one that we absolutely will I'm really
happy I'm so bad in life at being
satisfied and happy and I always now I'm
like if I like a dark side one day I get
that I've been debating now back and
forth first we were kind of like yeah
blacks my favorite side and now when
we're outside the white gets a different
tone wait wait up to see the motor core
the Sun probably going to change
everything again who knows and I still
haven't seen it being driven around so
doing I should have just driving around
here you want you want to see you yeah I
want to see it from the outside I'll
have you a spectator and haven't heard
it from the outside either
wait now am I supposed to the white side
now that's what the solution did left
everybody it's both this whole convoy is
insane
we're black or white sighs that's a good
part of it this new rep yeah like like
the mood you feel up every day I love
this thing enjoy - thanks a million and
thanks to everyone involved with the
whole team in making this happen of
course we're always on a short timeframe
that's why we're like doing mini details
in the end but it wasn't that long ago
that we decided on this but I think
everyone has now seen the car I hope you
heard it hope you liked it be plenty
more driving with it we have a 700
kilometers this afternoon after getting
up at 4:00 this morning but that's
