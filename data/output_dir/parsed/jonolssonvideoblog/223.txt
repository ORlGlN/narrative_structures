Bonjour
not if you're forever on time is this
night feels like neither yes lost the
noon I was surprised when I was like
yeah you hear I'm so excited I'm happy
to be with you
good I love this thing Rory's probably
one of the gnarliest skiers I have ever
met
so I don't know if it's a good idea to
pull you it looks like a terrible place
to go back yeah
today we're saying good morning on the
top of Whistler you know what I wanted
it today I want to be a ski tourist and
just shred just go ski with my
girlfriend look at who the girl
it's a good workout huh whoa
I never felt so uncoordinated and so
exhausted on thirsty sport thanks for
being our guide it sounds awesome
you guys do and you need the rich yeah
sick but we're so tired we all read
Amish well water left its pulse at the
top so we have to take one more energy
you want to know a secret
I'm cool talk dirty I can already see
the couch in front of me for people that
build a no Warner corner Speed World Cup
is a pretty good fear it's all you all
are you
Oh
I think we're really far left okay so
these turns and then Bank you're right
this looks all fully a lot like a club
move it there's a road right down there
really yeah
or maybe that's a summer road but it's
probably it's Whistler okay we're really
far from the ski resort you see that
I think it's thanks to say that we're
really like really really really lost
don't worry about it you've skied your
opal cups okay it just got a little more
serious all right let's see where this
takes us
Oh
Oh feels great
okay not so good
poodle
this right here Warner's what we call it
no fall zone certain depth like you went
from being a lot of traversing to like
try not to die like mountaineering on
skis I don't know
well no no we have a nice run down here
I just don't know what's below there but
we should probably hurry up because it's
going to get dark soon oh yeah that was
like taking out of a ski movie in the
90s okay this looks better Yeah right
well now we don't you really need to
know where we are because we know that
we're soaked in their own place all
right
oh I see a lake
I like maybe a road where you have this
no it's not the best true
all right the road I don't know I see a
lake down there
what would bear grylls - I don't know
Bear Grylls this the dude you like eat
snails and stuff you would aim for the
water and then figure it out oh we found
the bellows we found the pillow line
totally worth it right
I guess now been like 40 minutes since
we saw a truck the adventure continued
Hindi
oh man how did we get so miss tracked
they were getting closer I was about to
say I think we're really screwed
okay so new game plan yeah new plan
fly the drone up find out where we are
then go in that direction yeah get a
couple shots while you're at it - no
luck on the drone oh this is super sad
okay connect I say we keep going until
the reports dark I think that's probably
why we're going to continue passing
through there push push push
we found a road but we don't know if
it's 500 meters or 15 kilometers oh no
it's far
we definitely have some distance to go
really says turn in 5.2 kilometres turn
and 5.2 9 point 4 kilometers to where
we're going we got some distance brother
yeah let's go let's pick on ya breaking
trail here is not it's like walking
uphill and sand we have 5.3 kilometers
to go and we have not made one kilometer
yet here's Warner here's our track and
that's like what we came down I wonder
why we thought it'd be possible traverse
around it I think we won the lottery
today
yeah those like Whistler locals they
have no idea where the goodies
I think that was a car Oh hear the sound
to see it like being an exotic animal
come on you can do it now one last
mission hoping this camera is not going
to die down of water destruction and
then hitchhiking
whoo so the key to this is to make sure
that they know that we skied here so
they feel bad for us
so we look totally pathetic never look
them in the eye
whoo I'm just going to say you're my
favorite person on earth see you bud
let's run out here what a legend
you look at Warner that explains it all
we made it home and and I just feel
sorry for Andre editing probably the
ugliest shot footage ever hi
well because it's been raining and
snowing and batteries are dead them oh
he's there you are so psyched you didn't
come with us well beeper cholesterin and
like you yeah you get to end the vlog
just like it ok ok so I hope you guys
enjoyed their little submission today
and we will see you guys tomorrow again
maybe it is okay from dying absolutely
what you did ok you can see it tomorrow
oh yeah like you can't fuck with it you
need to follow your honor on Instagram
Warner is 50 followers away from hitting
10k force and this is like the biggest
thing for him oh my god no you're saying
was not dying today
ciao ciao
