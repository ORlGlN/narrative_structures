then roofs going on so lots of work but
lots of progress yes on it yes that's so
cute but now the good thing is that the
layer more Larry means the layer
painting company knows how to paint so
they're good with that
I'm just the concrete guy filling in the
little cracks but I keep getting told

yes like 20 to go
good job they're crazy but since they
have walked on it I had to walk to then
it is sufficient but if one guy drops it
for old like

sure if I'm sweating because of the Sun
to heat or adrenaline oh honey I loved
it
let's make another room yeah yeah not

no one know all of us knows how to do so
a little bit
so we were just about to go and I in the
bad but now it turns out the road is
closed so then what the road is closed

just sit in the back no way we're doing
it all the way yeah

we have a bit of work to do so pull
breast food and back at it again
and we have been home we have changed
and we're going for one last mission of
the day and it's to find a bunch of
things we need like whatever that's
called in English I've got great no idea
well to clean up the place and like
garbage cans and like stuff that we feel
that we need the route and the city
center the city center just like they
don't have any like big bucks or big
construction stores here so we're not
walk around see if we find anything that
we can use nothing this one nothing this
one and then this I feel like we lost
the construction zone
surfer Oviatt move them true run real
quick over there and soon felt like we
have a mission
we're always on a mission I'll burst or
anyone
now you've seen something look that's in
the road maybe they're all sitting the
same thing what we really want to find
is the bunch of good trash cans because
at the moment they use whatever they use
and they throw it on the ground so we're
trying to help them create a cleaner
culture yeah yes well as done because
their soccer field do they need any
kitchen stuff for for the kitchen I've
seen they were using kind of old pans
and it's good the more time we spend out
there and the more we see what we can
help with that is the difference between
Sunday money and coming here that we see
like okay these are the things we can
improve a change exactly least we have
the trash can
we should run back to the others they're
probably weather yeah
yeah let's run and take this yeah
we'll run back connect hello

overexposure to the Sun God well good
