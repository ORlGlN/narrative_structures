by Mexico City and it was up here
ah and I finally made it
after a 245 wake-up call and a lot of
traveling I made it to Santiago so now
I'm just gonna grab some sleep
gonna meet up with Benny tomorrow
morning and then we're gonna go check
out the Formula e race but I have to say
I am excited even though I woke up at
2:45 I haven't felt this rest that in
ball since I started vlogging so this
whole taking a break thing it's pretty
sweet but right now this bed looks
pretty good so sleep a bit and we'll be
right back with lots of fun things how
is the holiday that's great to see you
again there we go we are united in
Santiago yes
yeah what's happening now I don't know
what is happening we're going straight
to full speed mode so this is how we're
gonna start our day
thank you so much now this is a much
better way to start today and check out
the city another way
being able to see cities you visit from
this guy oh yeah get some cheap boards
love the pilot he was like you want to
fly some little stuff well yeah well I
think this is it for here I think it's
time to head over to the track and check
out some Foreman a race they can just
live life at 300 miles an hour and we
have arrived to the track and we figured
why not continue the day in full speed
with a bit of an I eight lap around the
track so we get to see the thing from
inside the car come on come on come on
so this is how we're going to continue
the day a little lap around the track
with the i8 just so we can see the track
from inside the car Bonjour what's you
are you good to go good place so how's
this track compared to Hong Kong it's
it's different I like it that I know
today I'm driving so I can relax and not
worry about learning the traffic yes
enjoy
I love being in a car with people that
can drive well
yeah but it's when you have a car like
that you don't wanna crash
everything practice makes perfect
I could go around the track every day
all day
thank you so much it's good it's good
now we're awake perfect to start out
thank you so far there's a pleasure now
it's fun to watch the race because now
you know the trick of it thank you so
much oh that's a good way to wake up dad
could just sit here for two hours and
keep driving yeah when you have a good
driver I can sit I'm at a snap now we
can watch the race
Oh how was it it was sick yeah I think
next time we should throw you in the car
yeah maybe they need a back seat and I
ate yeah but now and now I'm awake so
now we can get well maybe a coffee and
then food then it's race day
nice I love being on this side of the
camera yeah we're here doing a bit of a
pitch walk and I don't know if we yeah
we you were a feelings feelings and you
you better you're coming off two
straight wins and yes so we're a bird
here so we're here talking Swedish so
Benny can't understand what we're saying
code language exactly and what is really
nice today is that I'm not driving so it
means I can relax and enjoy in Hong Kong
I was so nervous the whole day just
stress so someone crashed you far
sweeter make sweet and proud crowd again
I recognize those we're back at the
wheels I just love these things

maybe this was it lucky people I get so
excited and then I realize no one else

actually been talking quite a bit on the
phone and emails because it's not to say
too much but we have stuff coming out

those wheels now we're being seeker
always said that I'm gonna be better not
being secret about projects yeah two

that we can discuss actual business yeah
for that good luck
Danya we're coming over yeah we're gonna
see you relax of the grid just for the
camera then what's it's awesome no you
see you seem relaxed go fast and don't
break any wheels maybe I can bring them

face time rice time great time where are
you going to stand why you're hanging
out here streets cars I see we go
spilled an umbrella yeah
get serious
good luck boys always
we like to be last yeah way to the end
getting the shawl
and we have that footage please who is
filming oh look at those guys
we are now being sent off the truck and
it's time to raise and it's bumpy and of
life is better barefoot so now we can go
watch the race and enjoy it anywhere
where I can be careful
damnit something
still way better though or you just feed
your sucks in there that's it
now I'm practicing my summer feet this
is the best way to watch her in love
okay say Monaco as well you want to be
right next to the track in the shade
with a good TV so you see everything and
we have like it doesn't get better than
this
keep on testing is this going anywhere
what can we never take the regular way I
think there was a better way the baby
was a shot kid
making super vertical foreskins Oh suck
you got a whole new level in terms of
hiking oh my legs
I like being late for flights the way
better than
this so as you can see we went back to
the hotel after the race changed chilled
got lost in the woods and then barely
made it up here for sunset yeah we ready
up here we're almost too late it's still
beautiful though so we are at zero Sun
keister bomb si si
and we figured that with the new year we
said we'd be more active and see more
places and do more stuff and this is
active but I say it's hard to find a
better place to end a vlog for the day
filled with activities so this one's a
quick one
ciao over not from Chile we'll see you
on the way to Japan on Thursday yeah
here Oh Benny time
