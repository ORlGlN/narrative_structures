about you should have a whole car
allocating like in a church of cars and
shooting the car this attorney vlog but

one pier with the player do is look look
at the camera and recording so we have
the Ronin Ronin love the right people

all right who knows the way to Whistler
come on Google
to return this thing offered
you
a burner this does not look like the way
to Whistler no it's not stop you this
will look like it's the way to it looks
like it's leading us back down to the
water towards the city we are hungry I
want food wanna start
yeah wonder you focus on the driving and
we we can look at the skyline so good we
got to get down they're going to shot on
it yeah Chris reactive yeah detour to
get a shot of the skyline and then we're
going to get to the water and have a
mountain covered the skyline oh yeah we
got a ton of options on the water that's
right sending us yeah do you think we'll
get to Whistler before pintuck no I
don't think so actually
and what we missed on camera was the
fact that the GoPro was on the form of
windscreen and Warner decided to use the
windshield wipers and broke them
whatever unit still works well in that
that was perfect
what was your spike scratches in that I
don't know it sounds like you know it
again that we're done no more windshield
wiper spa why do I have a feeling that
all the restaurants by the waters well
don't do not any wonder not - oh yeah
and we are shooting gopher at the moment
because we packed the batteries for
every other camera in the back of the
car I wonder has been on the detour for
25 minutes trying to find food where we
go repowered I told you subway I don't
want that boy no come on guys let's
split up

get to Whistler in somewhat of a decent
hour okay that's good it's been luckily
it's been like a three-hour exit the
city you think it was only three hours
you're dark so fat yeah yeah two seconds
back gone we're gonna get that sick shot
