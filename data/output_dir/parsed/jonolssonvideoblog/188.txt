good morning yeah good morning we're
back here on the beach and we're almost
killing it except I just like thought
there was a weird smell and then I
realized I put all my stuff and dog poop
we can work it by gene that's a later
four alpha for now we have good looking
waves so we're going to just go out and
have fun forget about the dog poop but
it's so sick to wake up in larvae on the
graves able to go surfing and now we
have cold blacks should have plenty of
grip basically life is good
yeah
when I thought that you get away like
that and like more pay off it's not easy
to surf out there because it's like a
little bit of everywhere so you got to
kind of figure it out yeah but it's so
weird sitting out there looking at the
same mountain I usually look at what I
play golf but that is what's so bad
about this so now my plan is like chill
for a bit gloves a good food maybe go
say hi to Yanni and then maybe come down
for some time so this still refuses so
fun right Oh success yeah
efficiency is everything involving
everything is well protected
when you borrow something make sure to
really take care of it now no chance of
anything bad anyway thank you
and what uh I've always said that this
is the perfect way to live except
there's no surfing and now they're
surfing yeah I just wish it was every
day but then I wouldn't have any time to
work so that would be a problem lunch is
served
oh I'm not a very good waiter
there you go on we have some Spanish
omelette we have some feta cheese on top
and some pesto on the side
thank you so much looks good it's
amazing yeah we got to stay and stay
energized to keep producing yeah look
we're on schedule today we are scheduled
very very good thought
now let's celebrate with some omelette
and then maybe like open up the door
here because now the weather seems to be
coming back to Marbella it's been on
like a bad mood but now it's better
again are you coming to steal the car
yeah flat tire tough
scheisse I said have fun but now you
have a great heart but you know I hate
to tell you I didn't expect you to
borrow it no no no you're you're good

Sun is coming back

finish the vlog me and the message I
wrote it there so this is a big moment
for kids enjoy is there a nice place to
go in town oh yeah yeah when will you be
back okay
come on lolly huh you get another chance
on you yeah let's see my girl oh shut
out bye bye okay then watch what should
we do I mean I have no idea
should we go into town do we have a car
yeah yeah okay from now we're going to
the grocery store as philippic rich even
more because we are here to team right
now and team overkill needs a lot of
good oh yeah
okay so I think the most awesome thing
about this car is that you can park it
like everywhere we got lost so that we
sub skier because we could love them
here now now we know the way I think
it's this way okay let's go
the tires are making it all week south
but if we are not even driving so that's
really funny
we have a handbrake or something so do
we have anything I think the other thing
yeah let's just open this one yeah so we
can have like fresh air coming into when
we are like doing the grocery mice why
why did you read the comments about me
know which ones are the one that said
that I was lying about my age that I had
to go back to kindergarten really I
probably just jump into the trolley
you
that was nice
hey under what alright well why do you
on the camera yeah okay come here you
all right here that's what does me
what's up B okay now let's split to the
house and we're home look you wrote it
the right way oh I think so before we
end today's vlog I thought it would be
interesting to show you our editing
setup
so the question we get asked like all
the time is what software do we use and
we use Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe
Ashley so it's basically After Effects
for the visual effects and prepare for
editing so I just want to show you guys
how much effort we put into each log
especially on the sound and especially
on the last one yeah the last one and
for those of you that don't know the red
doesn't record sound okay so I'm going
to play the sequence where u n-- is
chopping the wood and without music in
this listen to the sound it's all fake
that's why the vlog may sometimes be
like an hour or eight hours late because
we put so much low and so much effort
into each one yeah and by the way we
have to edit like it's time food is no
yeah okay 11:30 right now so 7:30 I
haven't almost Arnold wants to be active
he has to stubborn you yeah we shoulda
and today's rope now and we could say we
can do it in evasion
no oh we can do it in French you can
devote just like to do both at the same
time at the same time okay what do we
say like just by you tomorrow guys see
top okay are you ready
yeah three two one all about I added in
our age ciao
