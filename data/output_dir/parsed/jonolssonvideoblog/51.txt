I organized so we got the keys a bit early
If you think that I've been a bit weird the last few days
That's because...
I want to ask you something
They say it's better late than never
- Yes, haha
Thanks for being so patient with me
Will you marry me?
Of course I want!
Are you sure?
- Yes!
Your dad asked me
Are you buying the ring before she said yes
Of course I was going to say yes
I've been laughing inside when we've been talking about it
How long did you plan this?
You know me
Wow you made it so pretty here
WOW!
How do you know my size? Do you know it?
Sorry for not crying but I'm shaking inside
At least my shirt says I love you, haha
Are we getting married now?
Yes, I though so
That was what I was hoping for
You're the best
So when are we getting married?
As soon as possible!
And now you say there's one more surprise
- Yes, let's do it all at once
I've never been that nervous
Noo, I haven't noticed that much
- I haven't been able to eat all day
I haven't noticed anything
You're not the one who gets nervous
This was a bit bigger than everything
I've always known that I don't want to live with anyone else than you
And I've been thinking a million thoughts about what to say to you
But I think I will have to tell you that later
Should we sit down?
What an incredible ring, love!
It's not easy with rings
It's amazing!
I thought it was pretty
I'm so happy you said yes
- But what did you think?
You couldn't have thought anything else
It was like your dad said, you never know with Janni
It's the only thing I've been able to think about for a month
There's no other girl in the world that can come close to you
Do you want to take a photo?
I would love to!
- It would be fun to have a photo
Do we have anyone here in the house? 
- Yes
- What, really?
