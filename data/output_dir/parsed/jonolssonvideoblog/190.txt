good morning morning so this is where
team overkill is now over killing it
yeah and look at this we have brought up
inspired to to see if we can get that in
the air today there's been so many
comments on where is it
yeah it's been with you and I'm he is
not a technical smart person but it's
cool it's so much fun because I hear
these guys talk and I feel how much
they're learning from each other so
that's really awesome yeah but while you
guys stay here being awesome I'm going
to go and see how Yanni's doing and also
get some groceries I'll be back in a
little good luck I keep killing it don't
do anything I wouldn't do oh the Sahara
dust rain attacked the Abarth look at it
not cool
now I have to washer
how is everyone Hickman place
I am fully confident that I will not get
sick I have decided that I'm not getting
sick but if I'm sick tomorrow then
Michaela was 100 percent right but give
it two days and then you're sick told
you so
it all it all it can be yeah we're
getting there she is starting to like me
not just cry when she sees me she's
hiding a bit dashes buddy look at this
guy he was properly found attacked but
you look healthier today I just need a
shower you look like a girl that's alive
man not the mission ginger did healthy
stuff and taco burrito
oh boy this is gonna region local so
some more Apple
this is salt I forget to eat who founded
the last piece of Norwegian time
now this philosophy for the Norwegian
dive and success and always did we tell
you that yesterday we had to delete all
the files we had from buying for a chic
high like a security guard came and said
you're not allowed to film delete a clip
what the first time that's ever happened
oh that's like the only part that annoys
me that if you walk around with your
phone shooting a snapchat for six hours
in a store no one's going to tell you
anything and then this is like the exact
same thing only a bigger heavier version
of it it doesn't make sense in 2017 let
me film I want to film so I can make a
good vlog alright we're actually going
to spin home and see how Benji is doing
with the inspire is trying to make it
fly it's your Benji is doing well you
were how is this thing is it's fine
it is ready to play really yes no way he
needed to update three time on the
aircraft and two times on the battery
and I think once on this that explains
why I haven't loaned it
is this really happening I see so it's
the inspire to going to fly yes I still
don't believe it until I see in the air
okay this is like former team overkill
this is move over till the propellers
are so large yeah even bigger than
America
yeah yes yeah okay
let's lie of the stress okay we'll go on
the grass and it's really windy day this
is a huge moment it is a huge moment
been waiting for like how many months I
would say like 300 days since they
wanted them inspired it 3 2 1
okay we're good no more okay okay that's
done perfect you know what you haven't
seen know all the men good
oh no bedroom right so nice and even
made the bed yeah of Cour I mean if I
have to show you how to make it alright
you feel not bad right well invested
hello yeah what's the yummy in a little
bit
ready many eggs ready what do you have
there colonel
that's the cookie move I'm just like at
this point my point come on
yeah I like the nice guy okay we're
going to go jump in the water these guys
later
get help me by giving up behind somebody
she like got this thing that she's like
really scared of me okay so there's
apparently bet more waves than I thought
like they're just crushing over the wall
and Philippa Richards like there's no
way to get out on a jetski today but I'm
like what's the problem you're like
start it up and you go no problem what
do you think like I mean how bad can it
be like on the good you know jetski
we're gonna walk over there and like try
to look at the ocean and like see
faceless be baddest people say but it's
like whenever people tell me you you
really shouldn't do things you know what
I want to do do a joke what exactly same
but I do this
and we thank you that looks by to me
that's the end we don't think the waves
are not even breaking no doubt is
breaking on our looks like there's a big
wave goes I take the jet ski and I run
away from the wave the wave might don't
break see my little social thank you
like I always have this Joshua I do
crazy stuff I don't know why no but it's
like as long as I don't go make me like
being twenty again and do my lots of bad
 no but I'm excited
let's go because it wait is this what
we're wearing
yeah really yeah that looks like it's
the Bible suit though there's the
survival suit right
the no problem Oh bro go okay guys are
you ready you're ready
arguing rock'n'roll what if you're going
out that makes me feel better yeah but I
don't feel good at all great no like
he's crazy for himself ready but this
waves are like crazy real crazy
isn't that where we're gonna be space
now and see about in 20 minutes it's
going to be a total different place
he's probably smiling more no he's
nothing applies I'm the one who's going
to slice okay see you then okay
you are still alive even though this is
a very first thing that happens is that
I come out and it's like this giant wave
and Richard was ahead of me I'm like
what do I do
the only thing I could do is get blind
like this flew off the jet ski no way
so much sure you have to just keep it
like a heart attack this was a good
little Billy's besides that's why
Richard is the man because you can tell
him to go out and do stuff like this
roots like totally always say yes to
things you can't do oh wait
always that's a good one yeah I was
asked everything see we're still walking
off with a smile right huh no problem
so actually the guy who runs a lot of
stuff down here he said he's never seen
waves this big in 20 years that's pretty
insane yeah quit it quite big can we
call it the 20 year storm is that a good
title thumbnail we just need to do one
thing Richard said he'd buy me the gas
for the jet ski if you check out his
link in the description below you have
to take it out start follow me follow
you know all that stuff like all the
leverage they're going to have fun
perfect is it free now it's free
oh yeah I'm not going to see you hold
but I don't know many people in
Richard's age that would go out and do
that it's like we're the same only I
date your daughter yeah that would be
that would be strange if I dated her
yeah but like we look at you are you
crazy
it's a lot of similarities yeah that's
why I like you you perfect or miglin
rank right and we see you a large
evening we'll call you for surfing in
the morning Oh perfect yeah
mmm ever made it alive yeah my shoulder
can totally feel that we have been
jumping it was like Baba bomb
but I have an idea how about we just end
the vlog here like why show another same
the same thing up there it's not better
guys mm-hmm so that way you won't see us
in the couch we'll end it on a fresh
note just before the sunset and then we
will be right back hopefully maybe
there's some surf tomorrow but if not
we'll find fun things to do
as you can see energy is back p.m.
overkill is more overkill than ever with
two films and editors and we're going to
now we're going to start keep crushing
or now we're going to start crushing and
we'll see you guys tomorrow over and up
from our baya
and caustic amo ciao ciao
