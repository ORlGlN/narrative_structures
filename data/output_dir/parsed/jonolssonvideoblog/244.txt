the other day was good but there was
nothing compared to the come on pick up
pick up market you not want to miss this
hotel
good morning Marcos I would highly
suggest that you get your ski boots and
jump in them as quick as you can because
today is the decent day I've ever seen
and it's about twice as if that's the
first day it's once in a couple years of
oh wow I body tackle the tree I guess
great minds think alike
we're just gone permanently just having
just a blast though you're like I've
never seen stuff to see to know me to
really know nothing that's for breakfast
every single day
Japan is just of us all right I'll be
around there yeah
upon boy Marco hey welcome thank you
oh my God look at this all right I'm
just gonna punch through the branches
see what's what I literally could get
see because I couldn't see it more
whoa hello hello hey at least it's off
its off ah how I go straight I want a
Burger King
oh my god no songs wait and ever Marcus
I forgot the paper on my briefs Crazy
Horse reading in the gumbo now we're
ready to ski until they take our two
passes I'm thinking maybe we should go
and put on some dry clothes some City
what sweat for now we'll just keep
diving deep in the powder and do what we
do best in Japan Oh
I never thought that I could think that
it's too much no but this is truly
borderline fresh socks yes my dear or
not that that actually it's more top
layer because you get stool working pal
and then you're in the GaN way you get
cold the fact that we have this
thick-skinned scale please we'd be
stupid not to come in and change so
quick change to the audience yeah I feel
I feel like a mummy you got to hurry out
boys I'm good to go my mr. impatient is
is up and rolling for everyone that's
new watching this video you can also
check out the link in the description to
find more info about this place
as well as powder life who helped us set
up the trip to Japan because when we're
flying over we didn't really know where
to start like how to get the places we
didn't know anything know so if you want
some help setting up Japan trips just
check that out cos links look I think
after you've seen this you probably
realized that Japan this is sickest
place on earth to ski
you got an umbrella I have an umbrella
because I saw Daniel had one and I just
wanted to get a pot shot with it
yep so now this is like my lucky thing
okay today is what the deepest powder
I've skied in my entire life the other
days were maybe the deepest but this was
for sure the deepest most insane crazy
suffocating no scamming powder I've ever
seen
good night like stop like and I got
pizza whoa
actually we got 12 pizzas look at before
we get hard are I feel like we burn
20,000 calories a day here which is a
good thing but maybe I think we filmed
enough today to end the vlog here we
want Pete saying the face with the beats
on the bus asleep and then we got to
figure out what you do tomorrow if we
should just dive into more powder or
find variety in our lives
maybe that's the brick last mile hello
tough decisions to make
yeah yeah let us know in the comments
should we go get more powder or should
we do something else
yes or no yes or no there's still a ton
more up there okay so here we go
again over happened already launched
yeah Joseph can end the video blog he
says he's really excited about today he
thought the powder was really good it's
probably his best powder day ever in his
whole life so with that said he says
peace out we'll see you tomorrow Chuck
