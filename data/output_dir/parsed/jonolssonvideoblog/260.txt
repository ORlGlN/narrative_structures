it's happening
I've actually been debating back and
forth how much of a terrible idea this
is but then I realized that if I don't
test I won't know yeah
okay so every day in my life that I've
snowboarded has been regular today I'm
going goofy because I think it's gonna
be more or less like surfing okay well
can I say good luck well you know it's
cool to get out of your comfort zone in
the mountains which I never get to do
and since you're not around today I'm
gonna play around with this so Marcus
get better I will and wish me all the
best that I come together in one piece
my fingers are crossed for you I'm
excited let's go see how it is to go
heli
still boarding
you
so not our beautiful morning up here but
today we have one serious challenge we
have a snowboard so wish me all the best
I'm going to go ahead and try to not
slow this group down and be real fast
whew a good place to learn how to
snowboard right
oh my legs this feels strange
ah this is cool
hey good it's just hard to stop and
stand up I'm not used to having to stop
this often and catch my breath but I say
the more straight down you go the better
look at this it's kind of like surfing
on snow you guys see what we have down
there
but uh there's no morning things pretty
fun yeah you digging it yeah but it's
tough good challenge
you gotta sometimes to step outside of
the comfort zone that's right outside
the box now when I'm dropping in like oh
alright
snowboard pow pow
oh so I have the first run I feel like I
burned twice as many calories on a
snowboard than on a ski that or I follow
Mario burn even more
you
oh hello look at that
you best take that line you and I'm
gonna take it throw me up buddy I'm just
gonna take whatever line the snowboard
takes me I don't have too much turning
skills oh good morning Oh snow
everywhere
whoo going to be what real soon
this is great
I'm kind of thinking that maybe I'm
better goofy Oh regular I should try to
find a screwdriver and see I just gotta
get some speed speed is your friend whoo
whoo oh well now I know what it's like
the snowboard powder whoo focus up
volson let's do this speed here we go
come on
I'm tired ya know I'm used to being good
up on the mountain yeah as long as I go
straight I'm fine but then once you have
to turn it's difficult at least if you
crash it soft
alright so bindings are switched around
so now I'm gonna see if it's easier to
go regular let's take this run and just
cruise hello
look at this
Oh
now that is nice
whoo it's like a good version of taking
the bus up and down
cool no stress Oh cold in the neck you
could again camera want to go roller
all right let's see if we can do this
this is kind of beautiful
look at this nature
I think this right here is what they
call a 10-point roid yeah this is ski
for or board for
I kind of love snowboarding okay that
was the best of today hi oh honey I need
to say anything honey you guys you're
seeing how sick this is I love you
Canada
you
thank you so much great and I'm back
home in one piece
it was a bit unsure this morning but now
I've realised the snowboarding is really
really really fun and when the snow was
good I was not too ashamed of it so I
think I need to do this more often now
we're gonna go check how seat
see how Marcus is doing hope please
feeling better by now thank you for the
board so have you still got it
look it's still here I don't want to
know are you a goofy I am a regular are
you two runs and then I figured okay
that did not work so once I switched in
sick how are you feeling any better
actually worse really yeah is that
possible how was the snowboarding I
killed it and I killed myself
well first hello let's do this well I
was like bombing and then when I got
tired I couldn't turn or stop so I was
just going straight until a bush took me
I think you're gonna laugh quite a bit
when you look through the footage okay I
think it is time to end today I've been
stretching for the last two hours and I
think my body's actually okay Marcus is
still not feeling any better so he's
been resting in the room so I'm gonna
put this down and we are gonna check
back tomorrow see if we're going skiing
or snowboarding tomorrow
that was pretty fun I have to say bit
surprised but I guess everything you do
that you're not used to doing is fun
so overran up from Canada we'll see you
guys tomorrow I'm gonna go sleep tired
