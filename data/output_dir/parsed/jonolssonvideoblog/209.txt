like we should be event from here it
seems like there's only treating people
here like a hundred percent please keep
up there it's kind of hard for me to
move around so this I mean in order to
give a little recap of what we're doing
I'm here with Red Bull and I'm going to
run around do interviews be on stage do
some live commentary and basically run
around the event and then at the same
time trying to watch the event because
that's really what I'm here for

professional film er standing over here

waiting just like that Moses let me know

Cleophus without really even carefully
busy I was like with the cameras in my
face running with the red yeah yeah I
