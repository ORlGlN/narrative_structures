good morning today we're saying good
morning from Miss Clara telling
Stockholm and we are ready for Sweden I
just I just got a new I know people love
the Red Bull hats because hey that's
like the most common question like can I
get a red blot I just got this one but I
also got this this one I had you I think
this is my favorite I haven't looked
through yet any comments honey yes it's
dress because I want to go but yeah but
this kind of take like 45 seconds so
nice but it's not interesting if you
don't give any comments I give comments
on your holes yeah caps when Yanni is
stressed you got to make sure to go but
I just wanted to say good morning before
we jump out of the hotel and step one is
to go meet up with Yanni's grandpa yeah
and pick up the car and start driving
towards sweet Nora Sarina let's go
hiding secret bags no problem
ready in the back ready Bonjour 1 2 3 4
mudra rock in the range you've never
driven one of these before
and we are finally back in the car and
we welcome Samuel Johnny's little
brother who's not so little anymore
as usual our car is jam-packed and of
course Yanni has they will pick up a
package to jam packet some more
fits them number one after four and a
half minutes
we have a problem then we'll fill to the
max Tommy what Christmas gift yeah to
choose a strange angle here because we
have secret secret bags over here that I
can't show Oh secret since I can't film
that way I'm just gonna film myself
while Yanni is doing her best to see if
her packing skills are as good as an
alpine skier striking skills because
alpine skiers have very good packing
skills
I'd say I'd say this is Yanni's problem
you think it locked up dr. Boyka you've
just got to give it a good push
alright that wasn't the best classical
and welcome to mudra
we are in my holes where I grew up and
we left Stockholm at sunrise four hours
later we arrived to Mora at sunset
and it seems like me
yeah Mora is apparently becoming
extremely popular because I have never
seen a traffic jam like this getting
aggressive here in the traffic but we
have arrived and as you can see it's
beautiful and on the drive here I wanted
to capture that one of the most
beautiful places in my opinion as we
when you come over the corner and you
see that the city on Lake it's very nice
and very proud of where I grew up it's
really beautiful now we're gonna be in
line here which I don't want to be
because mom is waiting at home oh yeah I
can be the moral guide when I go but
