it's adventure time 100% is always thank
you from one adventure to another yep
we came back here into the port last
night and we're anchored up here for the
remainder of today so we're going to
take the little Bell cool

free as a bird
sir
that's only fun and games
it's only funny
isu I
you can't you just leave it like that
five six
I'm Ted I'm coming for you
that is what I call a deserted island
yeah I was just remembering that the
only thing we didn't do was write SOS in
the sand and shoot it from the drone I
really wanted a picture like that but
yeah this is awesome it's really windy
today so we're yeah we're kind of hiding
out to get some sounded are we got a lot
of music and not so much talking today
yeah but it's uh we took a boat out and
just hung out on this island for an hour
shot a bunch of photos of Yanni and I
read it's so fun to shoot when you're in
place like this then I clumb the
mountain or like Gorda Hill barefoot I
assume yes oh that's sick now we're
gonna go and see some other place
yeah no idea what but we just keep on
going
we swimmin do you see no problem we have
a water
yeah I told you it was the best idea you
wanna put that in there
it's only funny
searching for more
only fun
that's only funny
that's the only fun and dance
you got it don't be mad go cool go cool
down a bit
America is not a throw football top
Suites all this photography and hanging
out and seeing things and trying to make
your eyes focus on the world around you
makes me tired that's the quote of the
day you can never explore too much you
can never
yeah all right thanks so much smaller
one okay see you later
Charisse I see you later - yeah but
maybe we should do today's comment first
hair on the deck in the sunset all right
today's comment is about the only thing
that's not incredible and that's my back
yes cuz I've seen a lot of comments on
her you're not doing missed on a
semester the TV show I was going to do
and apparently the Swedish media
announced that I couldn't do it because
of my back and it wasn't really
coordinated because I was on a boat when
they went out and like it was kind of
like mixed information so yes it's
correct I am NOT going to be able to do
the TV show because my back is still far
from perfect and I am NOT able to say
surf and things like that and on the TV
show like that you need a perfect body
so I guess today's question is answered
yeah
with yeah my back is not great we're
doing everything we can to get it better
I'm trying to figure out what it is
don't know what it is but all I can do
is keep testing and analyzing and try to
figure it out and then a big MRI in
Monaco and oh yeah I'm to be good let's
just keep our fingers crossed cuz we
need you back doing stupid-ass you're
doing stupids - like one of the comments
no but one of the comments was like he
was pretty smart he was like you know
don't worry about your back cuz as soon
as it gets good you're gonna just injure
it again so you might as well just keep
going up yeah that's true no injuries no
yeah but it's a job yes okay Jo guys Joe
check out good Mikey's mom cool yeah
we're getting better
thanks I stopped by um fuck
