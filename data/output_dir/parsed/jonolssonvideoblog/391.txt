love on fire I don't know LBJ LBJ that's
the airport that we're going to we
barely know how to pronounce a name
we're going to go on an adventure we're
gonna fly pretty much the only thing we
know is that we're gonna get on this
flight we're going to be on a boat for
three days then we're gonna play back
here three days yeah so let's see where
this adventure takes no success I mean
yeah why don't you come along for our
adventure and we will see where we end
up or we keep way out up doing let's go
let's go
I love the landing did you yes I'm not
that dragons but I just really hope we
get to see dragons and for those who
don't know we are on what's it called
Komodo Island it looked like lost hey
did the only thing we didn't have was
the plane crash which we almost hasn't
landed nice to meet you Joe
hey Marquez nice to meet you that's it
you you're welcome okay thank you
such a beautiful flight coming in yeah
yeah getting the shot
did you see the boat it's over
yep cool I know it's nice to actually
one of the biggest boats in the harbor
for once you think we can call ourselves
camera nerds do you I think Yanni is it
could not have found better boyfriend
and team since we're like Halle Berry's
camera photos Oh yummy sleepy let's take
photo for blood
come on this is like this is the way a
vacation should be far away from
everything and then no more Valley you
know no exactly
it's like another world I love this I
mean we don't spend too much time with
people anyway so it might as well be on
a boat in the middle of nowhere we go go
to Nikon we're just like nature
yes adventure adventure in nature Maxie
that's the name merci now we're talking
boat like modern yacht sir and all their
cool but this is I'm sorry Richard but
this is cold it's a hundred and twenty
foot which is twice the size of
Richard's boat I think we should
probably give you guys a boat all right
y'all boat y'all boat I think it's a
sailing yacht to be a lost Torah we can
try show you guys because you guys seem
to like the the tours yeah let's do it
I want to see this as well this is just
incredible look yes we're come to messy
beautiful me thank you
Marcos thank you thank you so much

oh wow oh wow I can wake up here go for
a morning swim we used to think Richard
is both was really nice but Richard you
have nothing it's my dad I know it's
just fun to give him a little sad you're
cool I still love you
yeah I like it too I just like to give
you
what can we do to just stay here for the
rest of our lives build your own boat
true yes really I got my own room oh
yeah that's so you can edit sing drink
something here you like it's like a
house yeah you know look you made all
the art here as well which was really
cool
hey captain oh nice
make your luggage in there's a room take
easy and we just won ours have Frank
coming in woody okay
Oh
smelly that's what we call fresh fish it
reminds me of my childhood when we used
to fish yeah so we just anchored up here
in this insane bay and I really do think
we have arrived to paradise I feel like
we're in lost but times 16 we lost any
kind of cell phone internet coverage
hours ago and it's just insane here and
then the local fishermen over there just
caught this which is gonna be our dinner
we're so good first we're gonna go up on
that mountain and look at this
incredible place yeah and we're gonna
have a barbecue on that tiny beach over
there I mean Luke is like what total
paradise and since then I don't have
where I'm not even gonna try to explain
how sick this places I mean we have no
idea where we're going
we know up a mountain that's the cool
part yeah not knowing it is not a fish
adventure guys yeah under 10% I love it
like there's Hotel luxury and then
there's nature luxury and this is like a
nine star nature luxury resort this
Trump's the hotel luxury as well so like
a little bit of gold in a bottle and
Dubai not cutting it compared to this
not at all
I mean looks like Jurassic Park can
combine with loss a whole new level of
that thing I want to go barefoot cannot
reach it you can do it yeah I know I can
I mean if he goes barefoot I'm the
Barefoot master so I'm gonna go barefoot
as well but I mean not very smart let's
go I got this round
you
I was just telling Marcus that for the
first time in a long time I'm speechless
to describe this place
it's just in the same kimono it's right
there mmm
cut out but are probably coolest place
I've ever seen I've done anything
working out in like a long time so I got
real tired so what the craziest thing is
I haven't seen one tourist in the last
nine hours
that's the coolest part for us how we're
all alone team tourists no that's really
sick I mean there's not many places on
earth where you can go to not have a
single tourist around I love it me too
let's do more of this every day
huh I think we should head down before
that sunset and it's real dark yes
sounds like a good idea
sounds like a perfect end to a perfect
day and I think we're gonna end today
and try to keep this vlog
not too long yeah as you can see there
is not that many cell phone towers
around so I already know it's really
long so okay so it's really long and we
should probably keep it short it's a
problem but anyway we're gonna try to
upload this and hopefully it's not too
late but if it is I'm sorry because we
are in paradise
and we will see you guys tomorrow ciao
