going to start today with the challenge
because I've always kind of like known
that when Yanni goes for morning walk I
want to shoot it but then she would have
to wait for me and then be just weird
shoot it so I figured let's make a
challenge out of it and see what can I
shoot in one hour
if Yanni does not slow down she's just
going to take her walk and I'm just
going to have to run and try to figure
out how to shoot it are you ready I am
ready it's going to be a proper workout
for me because I have this thing to run
with and I have an appointment in one
hour and I got to get home and shower

hour with a lot of motivation and
rapidity ready yeah so I give this to
you and then you can just record me when
