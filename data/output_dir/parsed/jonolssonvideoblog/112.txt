test drive George yes - barb a uh two
thousand two hundred and eighty two
kilometers
starting at night yes that's a good idea
full speed as usual but I think the cars

think we should just get going and then
we'll see if we sleep on the way or if
we go straight yes and the other light
till I cover everything yeah we can
think and if we want to stop we have the
jet surf on the river and we can ride

happens it's going to be one of those
days with lots of Red Bull and matzo no
plan

amount of light that is a knight weapon

Katja was the wooden things
I have to say absolutely like the thing
is with cartooning in the cartooning
world it's so hard to find good people
who are good and I work with spectrum
motorsport al Gough they're fantastic
but they don't do rolls-royce that's why
I ended up going down to the motors and
you know I didn't meet them before it
did the Rolls Royce but I have to say I
can recommend them to everyone
they're super professional yeah they've
been great to deal with in every way and
I'm not getting paid to say this but I
really want to recommend it because I
know I've gone to so many companies and
I had bad experiences so do you have the
absolute motors is in the description
whatever you want to do just hit them up
because they're great guys and it's hard
to find great people that we love
promoting great things good large we
spent 48 hours straight fixing the cars
over yes know each other yeah everyone
was so tired at the end like didn't
sleep for two days
