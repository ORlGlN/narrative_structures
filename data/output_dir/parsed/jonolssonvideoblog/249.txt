reviewing Singapore Airlines sold for 11
points for helping us make that work
good start setup it up a minute maybe 30
come tumblin that's like good actually
wasn't it you know lounge is super
beautiful the food was so nice but who
cares about gambling about Japan
okay
have you ever been to Japan never tell
me about it I've been there five or six
times I think and but most of them have
been to compete where you fly in compete
and then you just sleep so you see
nothing but this time we're going to go
and experience at all like the snow
forecast we have in Hakuba right now is
I think it's a hundred and sixty
centimeters in the next two or three
days Wow
which is insane and I kind of feel like
we're you know that old movie Point
Break now where they're just chasing
that 50-year storm yesterday book in the
ticket I felt like point very like make
this company we should do this more
often just check weather maps and go yes
I love last-minute trips alright so
today we are going to review the premium
economy experience to Singapore Airlines
instances yeah how about it
yes good I'm happy they didn't have
business so we save some money
Ellen explain alright thank you
there's a same lady that checks us in
I'm glad she didn't check the weight of
the bag now
you see the businesses yes you know do
you understand why I save the dust
business yes I think they should have a
class that's in between business and
premium economy that's like that's good
at first and this looks like almost
economy oh yeah I get I mean like yeah
this looks like they're kind of linked
expected size by making my father talk
