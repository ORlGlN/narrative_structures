you're used it exactly once
look at this Sonic's hi see we've been
talking if we were to go with the red
setup we would need one of these ever
like occasions when it's really dark and
when you can't bring her up the funny
thing is that I pick up the one thing

version I've always had the prohibition
so I feel feel like I'm on the team now
yes
so is it dinner time um yeah you wanna
join us or you still dying Thank You mr.
photographer hi Oscar
thank you I feel like you know that dog
when it's looking on food inside yeah
that's you um I have an idea we get four
different things so we split up okay a
steak tartare the toast gaga nice and
chanterelle toast and the melon expert
for right and sweet potato fries I think
that's the best way to do it yeah
especially BMS hungry and now I can't
pick lambda
finally like a sit down chill yes yes
instead of like a pizza but some white
but I say we focus on this fools Swedish
pretty Swedish yeah sweet potato fries
special meal Anessa chanterelle toast
and beef tartare I totally get what
you're saying about that service in this
town yeah and the food excellent
cervix excellent tea no thank you
no and I'm like tea now there's so many
nice hotels around the world but the
last time I was here I told the staff
that this is the best hotel I've stayed
at in the last 15 years and it's
probably roughly 4,000 a couple nights
in the last 15 years is it
yeah but to launch a lot of nice hotels
but I think the staff is what makes the
difference so the hormone never forget
it Monaco
hey no joke
