good morning good morning how are you
I'm great
I have been testing morning anyone for a
walk and I'm good how are you I just
woke up I spent like four and a half
hours trying to figure out the red
footage yesterday how was that it was
hard I'm so disappointed in myself to be
honest really yeah why this is like hard
to grade I'm used to that to the light
go so it's a totally new thing yeah
everything in life you have to practice
yeah but I still want it you can't just
treat a red for five minutes and not
know anything about it and then think
that you can do it epically the first
thing and that's true
but it wasn't fun to try out yeah I mean
the like I've done 150 days straight and
I think you kind of figured that one out
so 150 days with the red I'm sure that
you're gonna be like goes piece of cake
no problem yeah that's hope so let's
hope I get 250 days with the red do you
still feel like it's a doable smart idea
100% okay like no questions asked
all that one there yeah but ok so sorry
guys for all the camera stuff we should
probably like do New York more than just
camera stuff but it is a long it is a
little vlog about our lives and we just
love that stuff we couldn't help
ourselves so I think maybe we should
just head out in the city and not spend
our hours in New York in a lobby so if
you're good to go
I just need to go up get a couple of
things and then we can tour check out to
see
lemonade oh thank you
the best thing about this trip is the
fact that we have like nothing to do we
can stroll around buy lemonade and just
chew photos and take our time and that's
really not every time I've been in New
York in the past has always been through
meetings and you had to run around the
city and do a million things we didn't
have any time to chill the only thing I
know I want to do today is upgrade my
wardrobe because for some reason I left
everything I owned in Marbella
so in Monaco I literally have five pairs
of boxers like 60 shirts and two pants
so and I want shorts look at those big
spotlights
it looks massive yeah it's like
claustrophobia yeah how do you know
where we go like where's the entrance to
this thing
I'm more excited miss not to talk about
cameras tonight yeah but they were I was
just saying what was over there
they are cool I agree with you
but do you think of all this Yanni I
mean I love the shows because of the
clothes it's nice to get inspired
many people it's just chaotic yeah you
doesn't really like people nothing
hiding in the corner Yoon you're in New
York
shake the up it's literally hiding
in the corner in the Sun in the Sun
are you afraid of other people
there is a lot of people here this is
more like oh yeah let's start and see if
they have a table we've been struggling
to find a rough it's like we have a
restaurant to ourselves perfecto exactly
what we needed 100% cookie this is it
sad that we love when it's like quiet
like chill it's not that at all okay
good I like people but it's nice to like
get away in chill for a second yeah well
Bon Appetit malkos I love this lunch it
was like a going home and recharging in
the bed you know what fascinates me tell
me all the fire escape stairs in New
York I am assuming that this fire escape
stairs in New York because there was a
certain rule back in the day when they
were built that you had to have one and
now they're just really cool you know it
doesn't feel like any other city in the
world it's just different
so you need
cars
that's how that's what you got to do you
got enough to be afraid of the cars and
sores I think we got it though so cool
I'm great yeah not that's what I called
speech shopping yeah you like it
approve I should approve all right we're
back at the red store we promise we'll
be real quick this time how are you now

friend who called us up this morning and
