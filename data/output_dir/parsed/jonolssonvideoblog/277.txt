of check for before discard Amaro and
then we're gonna get back to normal
Marbella life for like a few hours okay
and not eat Snickers today

let's do this
100% normal right
I think your daughter's pretty cold
about a thousand kilometers in this
because bad like 300
that's enough
remove from the outside
oh I think I love the sound like the
Travoy but she needs a good clean
your flight is right with you never in
my life

Dean despaigne anything yeah I'm totally
into flutter please you and me Marcus
you gotta do it let's do it let's do it
one we have to start over water we can
like swim lucky me ha ha ha come on Yin
push him don't start it
go Richard go I'm flying
yeah but I still don't really understand
how you you have a parachute and then
you glide with a parachute and then this
Carlos a land guy in the back has
parachute see this would scare me would
it I mean it looks awesome but I want to
do it oh I'm sure you can I think I'd
like to stay on the ground what is this
like the check button I'm out it's
probably to be honest like this the
eject button
no it
I think you're uh maybe the gasps yeah I
think so but well this is the nose
button then no yeah
fasten the furies okay well this is on
the list of things that we fuck with
Markus in this cannot big spell thank
you thank you soon so that now we just
dropped off the car so they're gonna
work on it for a little bit just to make
sure everything's on during 10% mm-hmm
we're gonna go back to the house nice to
go back in a real car bye see you later
yes it's a chill day today I'm really
tired today I don't like being tired are
you tired I'm fine
I'm tired as well so it's two against
one yeah so tired it is alright I have
new glasses
Oh check it out hold on I have Morgan
link below yes link below are you
sponsored I actually got these Nevada
nivi does it sit yeah okay cool yeah I
got these for free I'm not really nice
it's a friend of Yanni who helped me out
yeah how do I look like now I can
actually see like I've been half wine
those were cool I like those I just like
seeing I don't know how I look yet cuz
you know when you're not used to wearing
glasses you always feel strange seeing
yourself with glasses yeah but I love
these it look cool yeah thank you yes
but because that is good cuz I am gonna
show you what my next order of
businesses do not helmet yeah that is
just no design on it so today I'm gonna
put some serious camel artwork on this
on the helmet yeah cool and then put
this rock star whoa whoa you're gonna
have the coolest hell with of all time
but it's really hard to do camouflage or
rapping on a helmet so I'm gonna try to
do my best but that feels like a perfect
plan for today we need to cut wood too
so we can make more fire should we do
another slow mole wolf good job yeah I
guess that's been done already but we
shouldn't cut wood okay nice weather
today yeah it was actually really cold
this morning let's do it let's do this
oh fuck you okay yeah what happened
like the fucking dude I could have
killed you
fuck okay we learned something today
look at this like it cracked the rock
I almost killed Marcus like actually
kill them
so Marcus you get in your head
no it's fun like skimmed it what so I
went for the full super-ninja like this
mark is sitting there and then this
thing let go and I sat here like this
like I literally yeah yeah but just the
handle I think it's no blood or anything
so that's fine
but it could have been the axe like this
straight in my face what maybe my heart
started pumping no my I'm like freaking
out that yeah that axe is retired
oh it's fine it's okay it's okay okay
lesson for everyone out there do not put
your friend on the opposite end of wood
chopping yeah like that scared the shit
out of me get let's Jim from beside me
yeah keep the distance yeah fuck like
that is true death yes
wait let's watch this shot see if you
can see it okay ah look
look yeah look you have some blood on
your finger whoa
from holding the camera whoa fuck can we
have the title I almost killed Marcus
without it being a clickbait at all
we've used it but yeah you almost kill
me like this is that's blood from the ax
missing your head by two centimetres
from now on let's keep the distance from
now on um you can have your wood
shopping in peace you know what let's
spin to the wood up there good job Oh
time I thought it was gonna be a chilly
fuck I'm still stressing
are you I mean we do so many dangerous
things and then we almost kill you doing
yeah chopping wood but it's okay relax
I'm fine yeah but I'm just worried about
our intelligence of like putting
ourselves the fact that I'm stupid
enough and I'm stupid enough one of us
should have somehow along the way
thought maybe this isn't a good idea
fuck we need to have the helmets on at
all times in life yeah I can't think of
anything worse than if that would have
hit you yeah but it's okay we got a
relaxed I'm alive we have wood them from
now on there will be no more wood
filming segments at least not from the
front I have a bump in my head that's
the only thing it's fine you actually
have a bump yeah of course
oh of course have a bump and hit me
straight ahead it's okay it's fine it's
no blood everything is fine and the
transformation begins yes I just wish it
was a flat sir Oh
flats orbit Alvin is that not you like a
buff settlement
well like round things are really hard
to rap see they're going to work out
really good or I'm going to be here
frustrated in four hours with a crappy
design and a crappy helmet so see you in
four hours
probably like if I want this to be in
anywhere close to good idea
you
it's coming along it is coming along as
you can look at that oh nice
but yeah it's like you learn for like
the first little patch took forever and
then it's getting better and better
good I'm getting faster yeah you're
figuring out what the toughest parts are
and how to try to avoid them I love it
it's getting that yes it's hard to see
before it's like you're more precious
and then we're there yeah it's tricky
with a helmet and then you want to leave
some of the carbon out there hmm you
don't have too much so normally I always
decided in Photoshop first so then I
kind of have a outline of what to work
with but now I didn't so now it's like a
hundred percent test and random the only
important thing is that I try to avoid
like if you see this shape here like the
pointy shape I try to avoid that like
you see here like you've cut it off cut
it off so there's like yeah there's a
couple things like oh yeah see this
shape here I never go 90 I always open
them okay I have a few like guidelines
that I always try to keep when I do that
mm mm are the science it's not like a
hundred was not random it's it's like
random but with like a million thoughts
in it I'm gonna leave you to it thank
you
I'm gonna yeah I'll be here
you
look come look at this yeah we did it
yeah good lord really smart like what
happened with the wood to all the
chocolate later two really smart guys
right hey look hair like it's like
that's close a centimeter let's go from
like instant death I thought I kill them
like but you're looking for another one
right so I don't have the money look at
when you Marcus see you tried to kill
him watch out partners wear helmet you
poison my food so in reality we're
looking for someone else that works for
free and I'm trying to kill Marcus to
cut amount of this now that you do okay
let's eat watch out for the food no I'm
just giving it a bit more power that way
put more wood on it because no this
