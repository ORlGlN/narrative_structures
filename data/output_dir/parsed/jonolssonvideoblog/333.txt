good morning good morning how are you
I'm good the new morning in new country
just landed here in Zurich in
Switzerland and now we are on a mission
to find the hurt yes which has supposed
to be transported from stock over here
and I have still not seen it with my own
eyes no one heard it or heard it or
anything or drilling it put the crazy
upgrades I see something that looks like
something that oh there it is horrible I
see a little camera design there I've
only seen it in Photoshop
yeah I'm excited
I get excited about pulling my patch the
mound yeah a little bit cuz of course
they're not the ski box
courses that we're just gonna remove the
foam I'll get tied down and we're ready
to go just one cable Peppa Pig yeah
thank you you're welcome
we were so close this close interpreter
we couldn't just we don't have a ticket
for their second car to get out then to
drive it to the gas station which is
right there so we're gonna just run over
there so I want to get in the coffee
shop you to attempt number two I'm
curious to the sound
that's how a car supposed to sound on
startup
all right that time jump in the car if
this thing feels like I wish I wasn't
raining cuz I'm pretty sure this doesn't
have traction for the rain let's go see
if you think that the seats are
comfortable oh my god I got laid group
not bad right this is nice it's a modern
Lambo where you have Lambo but you have
outage knowledge and then start man's
superpower
this thing is insane
it's so loud you didn't think it was
fast you start aloud it's both
oh my god
I'm not scared to hit the throttle and I
told myself no hitting they asked before
we leave insulin
it was just from slaughter you know
water wise yeah hey still filled up
I've been Sun on the GPS yeah you can't
test the car like this with this much
power in the rain
that wasn't even for gas and that is not
stuck is it no this car is not stuck at
all
underneath that foot we have an a
supercharger
from VF engineering but that man has
rebuilt and customized the whole thing
so it's a much more extreme version
have the inventory carbon air intakes
but it's wild back there
and the sound of my god
one last time
per year
it's so perfect but it like that was all
at that mean Switzerland 99 am
it's the best car I've ever driven no
questions that's the one and you've
driven a lot of cars yeah
it's like a sporty version of the rs6
it's more raw an extreme multi-camera
we're going beast mode activated
you
it's windy here yeah I'm not looking at
the way they're looking at the snow at
the top of the mountain I think we
should be okay but we are almost over
with Switzerland and highway so let's
try to get through a couple shots from
the outside to get a better impression
of this thing he had some sound sound
accelerations in all that tough to stuff
you should have in a car video ok let's
do it let's go
you
ah welcome hello hello we made it I can
honestly see without a single doubt in
my mind this the best car I've ever been
it it's stupid fast which is the way it
should be
this yeah and we haven't had a single
problem which never happens to me
retarded high-five with that so I guess
did we talk about what was done to the
car no let's do some okay quick yeah
quick round our feet we have the 56 key
box all carbon fiber but inside the
engine that's where most of it has
happened we have a VF engineering
supercharger but totally customized by
stuckman motorsport in Stockholm so it's
completely modified and more extreme and
we have the inventory air intakes and
all carbon of course and then the crop
of exhaust to get the maximum amount of
awesome f1 sound yeah and then we have
gyro breakfasts and steel because when
you use me in the winter it's just
better with little rocks flying and
temperature changes and everything and
we gets lowered rap soon help me make
this amazing design that I designed on
the boat in mutton the Maltese 3 days
ago three days ago yeah yeah it's been
really quick trying to get everything
together but yeah let's get some numbers
in there but I don't have number I can
okay so the only numbers I have is
during testing and then 100 to 200 was
5.3 but I know it's been optimized since
then and 5.3 comparing that to well the
numbers I found said of Arran does it at
5.0 and this is five podr√≠a well I hope
it's faster than 5.3 now that it's
optimized so yeah we got to get some
real numbers later but we know that it's
got way more than 800 horsepower and
it's way fast enough to have some winter
transporter for 2016-17 I'm so excited
yeah and of these got it not forget the
mounts that under at select cars help me
make like yesterday morning tee shot so
everything came together
we have another single problem and we're
here in Italy and we're gonna enjoy two
days here yep
so with that said we we work up pretty
early in Marbella this morning after a
long flight yesterday from the Maldives
so I say we close the ball here and I
hope you guys enjoyed that little bit of
car stuff yeah but now when we have a
car and make our stuff like every day
every single day
so how do you say goodbye in Italian I
have no idea let's just say good night
today and then we refresh our brains and
come back with the Italian version
tomorrow yes alright we'll see you guys
tomorrow I've had an awesome day me too
but
