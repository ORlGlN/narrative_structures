from the top of the mountains in
beautiful Lavinia and what better way to
say good morning thank you from here let
me check out the place hey man here

what to do it is incredible and the
reason in the first place there up here
is because we got invited by Roger
debris do you remember the watch brand
that we went to the Lamborghini factory

with the cars up here but we figured why
not jump in a heli in the morning while
we wait for the cars to get ready we did
something to kick-start the day we good

first time with this kind of stuff
it's rationally skiing first heli

suite I'm really scared I'm still I'm
shaking like that last room we're coming

gonna go and change out of the ski boots
and see how well Lambos behave sideways
and we are here hey guys
and yannis here too when you have all of
this standing around it's hard to think
straight and the reason that we are
gonna be able to have fun in these is
