good morning and this is not a bad place
to say good morning on either I'm all
alone in a valley bottom because I
schemed down I couldn't see anyone and
now I'm trying to figure out what the
group is but at least I'm here by the
red flag so I think this is the heli
pickup but as you can see it's another
incredible day I'm back on skis and
we're just gonna go and have as much fun
as we possibly can which is not very
hard at all on a day like today and
today since it's kind of grey bird I
figured today we're gonna shoot the
whole vlog in black and white because I
always wanted to do a black and white
vlog so I hope you enjoy it we're trying
to get some variety which is a bit
tricky when you have helicopters and
epicness every day but we're trying our
best just have a fun hello I'm here come
pick me up can you wave choppers down
like heli are like taxis need a ride
please no I'm over here oh there they
are
I didn't see anyone on the way down so I
thought I was lost
how come you think that I still told you
anything more the pain more than the
pouring rain I can't be more to explain
I won't go down now we're talking a
little bit of Sun makes life better
hello good morning
Oh
the green light from the star it wasn't
a fight I was getting old
and so anyway no longer will you keep me
I'm liking it really it's a really bad
spot to kick a tree here oh no whoa I
lost this key
I felt pretty close right yeah got it
just never get sick of the view the snow
the light
you don't want to get lost out here
then you are wolf food
that steep part was epic dad you see
slide along dog boy boy
Oh as if we're not landing
trees powder
and fun
now that was a quick recovery hold on
let me put this on facing back alright
let's try again
whoo
hey fuse on the back of this
you
oh my legs I got got to jump a little up
there as well the middle yes yes yes yes
it's kind of unreal how many runs to get
here eight hours of skiing Luke really
puts your legs to a good test so if
anyone is going to go heli-skiing make
sure get in shape first you lock me out
you don't want to be my friend anymore
no how are you feeling
standard question everyday how is Marcus
feeling not everyone can say that they
want to see matron slept poor guy
well if it's any consolation you would
have been laying exactly like that in
the snow if you were skiing today
because my legs are done like they are
like fantastic day though yeah let's see
okay me over there now
ah
hello mr. Olsen
Bonjour he's going on I found a really
nice corner here the chair so I'm like
looking all funk in the corner here by
the fire yeah you know but it's every
afternoon I've spent about an hour and a
half two hour stretching and then
rolling on my magic thing so it's like
trying to just get the body ready to
keep going tomorrow okay and as you know
my back has been pretty injured for the
good better part of the last half year
mm-hmm so then going straight into this
skiing eight hours a day then you have
to take care of your back you do even
though it makes you look like a total
weirdo humping a chair showing it to
half a million people yep but we are not
afraid
No yeah six forty to twenty minutes
until dinner and then right after
dessert I'm running to sleep okay if
you're wondering why we're not showing
anything else besides skiing when we're
here it's because we wake up
edit a bit of video I can start it
tomorrow when I get to work but then we
ski all day and come home stretch
eat sleep yes and do this
it's dinner time since you're excited
for dinner it means that you are feeling
better yeah I'm actually eating for once
I haven't heard you excited for food in
four days yeah that's a good sign it is
but since we're just gonna go eat and
then once we're done eating we're gonna
sleep I say we end today here I agree so
I hope you guys enjoyed another ski day
it's hard to make him different cuz it's
all we do a ski in their streets and
there is powder and helicopters not
today at least it's knocking y-yeah hope
you guys enjoyed something different I
know I can white so yeah maybe we'll go
back to color tomorrow No maybe Ryan
maybe I will be skating tomorrow who
knows who knows let's hope for that
let's all keep our fingers crossed the
mark is feeling better and maybe I even
do a backflip
no that's stretching it okay you all
heard it we'll see you guys tomorrow
over and out from another kick-ass day
ciao
