it's funny that we're here because I was
talking to - Janos my physio yesterday
we were talking about extreme things and
we're talking about us getting lost in

lost don't worry about it you've skied
Europa Cup okay it just got a little
more serious all right let's see where
this takes us okay not so good
Oh No this right here Warner's what we
call it no fault zone certain death that
was awkward
oh yeah we had a great moment in
Whistler getting lost going down on the
wrong side of the mountain and that was
really good and then we have a journey
over there yeah it was really fun
the cheerful Church filled with a lot of
old friends that we have a lot of
memories badass skiers a lot of
Norwegians yeah yeah a lot of Norwegian
with some Americans as well true from my
life when your skier you get to know
friends across the world yeah so that's
why everyone's in there and we should
probably like check that thing in in the
car and like go join everybody should we
just show your guys outfit first where
