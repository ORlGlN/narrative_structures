awareness here will my stop so again to
God I guess I'm just not sure that

apparently not smarter in the morning so
Gweneth es windows why not dia I'm going
to really work on this we left cut
agenda this morning yes early on at 5:30
Richard jumped the gun he said we'd
leave at 6:00 I heard the engine start a
might there's no way think the clock is
it's dark out but now we're yeah we're
cruising me and Richard we're getting to
know each other take this out here so we
are currently here going over there 12
hours to go oh yeah plenty of time to
relax and talk about the meaning of life
yet know each other and find open to
shore yeah we probably saw one now
earlier but we were wrong
we were wrong there's not awesome oh
yeah like I grabbed the camera might use
now but gas generally it's a great
morning
