yesterday's video today myself Alfie and
Nala are all going to go to Tanya and
Jim's new house and I'm really really
excited because we don't get to see each
other as much as as much as we would
like and obviously we don't live near
each other so it'll be really fun and
it's not as first trip to stay at Tanya
and Jim's house so I'm sure she is most
excited my Isaac very blue today oh my
god if I ever shown you guys my little
fireplace section I really like it so
we've got a little succulent in this pot
this is actually a candle holder or you
can turn it the other way in it's a vars
holder candle which is actually dripped
I need to get all these drips off this
is dying people that say succulents are
easy chirp after you need the right
environment just get a blame on the
environment this is one of our these
pictures of Brighton I got these given
to me at a book signing I don't know
whether it was at one of alfea's or or
if it was one of mine but these aren't
actually real so they'll never die thank

why'd you have to make a little house
around it and just so that the coals
will look like nicely I really shouldn't

man who was in the cinema see - that
rubber won't see lame is that's
something family huh when we're
interested in mice in the men's room

not really a little isn't it yeah um but

right now I feel like I may even be kind
of a massive slum you've got the really
soft cozy blanket I know I've got this
mmm
so go as cold as you want it on your
face the craziest thing I'm always cold
so not gonna be really busy up in that I
think I'm I have to buy it
where's it from Sweet Pea my god that
means someone may have a yellow I don't
know but I got to look through a booklet
I know it's fine I'll just steal this
one without thinking obviously it's fake
fur but it feels like it reveals like a
cuddle a whole booklet of all different
colors and I think my words I kind of
want to get like a grayish one foot of
the bed up so my words it's like the
best thing if you guys can't see what
we're talking about is this mammoth but
it's so low so blanket is amazing
because when it doesn't move when I used
to be when I used to babysit the family
had one of these like a rug on the floor
like that it was so good
oh I mean I definitely didn't let you
slam the floor yeah so we are gonna go
to sleep soon but Jim is coming tomorrow
and we're gonna hide from him so he
thinks we've got home um
Alfie actually found a video of when do
you remember together when when when
I'll be hitting the bed so it was me it
