Oh God why have they all gone this way
I'm so tempted to just throw them away
I'm sure they'll taste great but I'm
definitely not giving these to Tonya fro
birthday I am just about to film a video
and this is my current set-up Oh
oh hey
and there's my camera and there's Matt I
think um she's not usually here every
time I put my videos by the way just
standing there helping me with every
single video what a mess what a mess

guys I'm just preparing myself and
Natalie a little fruit trio and I'm just
gonna crush this blackberry which i
think is like not normal like a super
black bread look at the size of these
honestly they are huge so just thought I
would let you guys see a little bit more
of what I do when I'm not doing a like
fun stuff so right now I am sad doing
emails and making notes about things and
editing and sorting out wanting to film
and that's Natalie's phone yeah I do
want to show you these though these are
said to my few opps actually break them
they're not for you Ginny's guinea pig
things I've done
they are my favourite my own pin balls
in tropical flavor going crazy anyway
I'm excited to try these I might try
them in a minute just tried the Mau one
balls amazing you know what flavor would
be really good water
no not waka melon yeah no I've got to
say pineapple but that's the one in
there what am I thinking of alright like
grapefruit maybe watermelon mmm they're
good Wow
over the top I am now about to carry on
with my emails and do some makeup brush
washing I'm actually going to use this
shampoo
this was just the closest thing I could
find actually this is some Darrel E
we've just had some daily bagels which
were particularly yummy if I may say so
and then I'm gonna line my brushes out
I've got enough brushes look how dirty
they are gross gross always wash your
brushes just in case any of you guys
wondering how I wash my brushes I take
them sometimes to at time just I live
life on the edge
and put a little tiny bit in the power
of my hand just a small amount dip it in
the water and then I literally just
swirl it around in my hand make sure you
get all the makeup out give it a little
squeeze and then rinse it up and then
obviously change the water as you're
going along so you're not doing it in
dirty water the whole time but they tell
to be quite come out quite clean anyway
okay and then just pop them down on
something to dry just leaning over the
table and this is the problem with
kimonos guys yep I'm a fall it's comfy
hoody time guys I ordered a rug to go
down here oh excuse the fact that the
fire is on and I got really chilly so I
quickly put it on to just boost a bit of
heat but I got a rug to go down here and
and if any of you remember my hot dog
mugs I basically got a fox dog rug which
I don't know is it's going to go or not
but I really liked it
so listen roll it sexy slippers yay
there's my little Fox table rug it fits
perfectly which considering I didn't
measure is is good going
always measure before you buy a rugged I
feel very happy now with all these
colors feel like this ties in with this
yes a bit of a perfectionist so I've
just been sorting stuff out and I like
it a lot considering I still have little
bits and pieces to get and still have
like a little different bits that I want
to put in my house to make it more of a
home to being happy Bobby and Shawn for
