good morning it is 20 past nine I have
just got ready well it's a bit limp
though today I'm going to have to put a
bit of hairspray and I think and I go
it's trick today which is most unusual I
normally have it curly or up but I
thought I would have it straight um I
have had a bar and basically I'm getting
ready because I'm having a photo shoot
this morning for the book because you
know inside the book cover there's a
little picture of you and kind of about
the author and things like that and I
don't have any photos I've taken myself
that I feel like are really good ones to
use and obviously the photos that I have
done on other shoots are not owned by me
they're owned by the company that did
the shoot because they've paid for the
shoot it's all really long and
complicated and pretty boring but
basically I can't use this both toes
because they are not mine to have so I
am taking some fourth book and they are
going to be here in about ten minutes I
think um my house basically looks like a
big party zone right now as well we've
just got like balloons and cards
everywhere because it was Effie's
birthday yesterday
but that's so cool I am filling out some
forms for something watching a bit of
YouTube and I just thought I would say
hi I'm also drinking some orange juice
and I have the worst lady pains in the
world I never have this issue normally
and I am like having to breathe that
this this morning like like I'm like
gripping things and I'm in a lot of pain
so if this is a weird labor that I'm in
I didn't really know I was gonna have
there maybe a baby in tomorrow's vlog

anyway it hurts sometimes being a woman
sucks but it's also freaking amazing
