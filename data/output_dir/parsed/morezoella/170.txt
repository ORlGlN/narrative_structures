good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 21
it is cold this morning and it's so
early the Sun has just risen with the
cap beautiful sky looks this morning and
it's so pretty
birds are tweeting tweeting cheeping
chirping that's something you can see my
outfit right now
I was very kindly sent this jacket
actually but don't know what make it is
but it's a really nice one um and it's
been keeping me very warm on these
little dogs don't morning's look at me
I've got Joe shoes on so we're going
back today which I'm kind of sad about
actually because I'm really enjoying
being here it feels very fresh and quiet
and I'm gonna no it's just nice to see
everyone right there
Oh - maybe it's because you keep eating
so much grass Nala so I'm going to miss
like yeah the freshness I suppose the
outdoors although it is fresh and
brighter I don't really know what I mean
when I say that I think it's just
because here it feels I feel sleepy no
because it's not sitting you know in the
middle of the countryside um I'm a
little country bumpkin so in my element
here the novel is also an irrelevant in
this garden so I think she's going to
really miss her my hands are literally
freezing off oh but yes we're going to
just walk around for a bit in the garden
wait Nala up and then I've got to edit I
basically fell asleep and didn't edit
last night so that's not good so I need
to finish my home tour Eddy

we're going to make our way back about
three hour drive two and a half hours
it's not too bad oh my goodness I'm
gonna have to go inside my hands are
like freezing off I can't log anymore I
was still proving she's doing that kind
of creepy pooh walk uh uh look
than sun's coming up

defrosting somehow oh I'm gonna find
editing quite tricky with no use in my
hands should we get you some breakfast

home to the real world what living with
Casper is the real world where is he oh

time to leave Joe's just gone
my dad's taking him to the station and
Alfie's just packed up the car and
Nyla's had her last little massive run
around haven't you I actually didn't
realize how much stuff we brought with
us so much stuff we were like oh well at
least we don't have to have all the
seats down the way back yes we do I
don't know how that's happened but we
still have seats down I guess it's
because we've given presents but we've
also received presents which I didn't
really take into account before we came
here we still have a very
big carful of stuff um but I'm excited
to get home you excited to get home into
the guinea pigs have you missed the
guinea pigs Pippen and Percy she's not
had a nap today yet so you're gonna be
so sleepy in a car on you got your
blanket yes we have yes we have hey good
girl
we're home we've got the fairy lights on
candles lit and we just have a lot of
unpacking to do we also ordered a little
cheeky little wagon momma's about 20
minutes ago on the app so that will be
arriving soon which I'm very happy about
it's Trey coming over yeah it's in taxi
J's on his way think he's gonna join us
for a walk among us because him and
Alfie are going out to a friend's house
this evening which means it's me and
Nala
in hey in on our own and what I might do
is wrap our fat Christmas presents
because I know that that will be my only
chance to do it I think um but yeah
basically all I've done today is getup
hat you know Drive and unpack bye think
so I'm sorry if this is not a very fun
filled day but you know that's just what
we've been doing drivin driving home for
Christmas is what we've been doing ya
don't have anything else to update you
all right now so I'm gonna pull off just
notice I had a delivery arrived whilst I
was away it's not very exciting but I
thought I'd open it with you because you
might want to see basically I realized
very quickly that I did not have enough
wrapping paper for the amount of
presents I have to actually wrap so I
did a last-minute Paper Chase order
because paper trays have some really
lovely like just easy to wrap up
wrapping although I did my lovely
do-it-yourself wrapping video uh turns
out I'm not gonna have time to do that
for every present so I have bought some
bits and pieces
them to you um let me see
got a little bag cuz you know gift bag
is always good in some cases little gift
box boo tissue to put inside the gift
box so this is just white with specs and
then I really like this this is got like
oh that cool yeah yeah why it's not
technically Wireless though because
you've got them plug you've got a wire
oh bugger mummers or change
yeah lecture that I don't know my
favorite unzip know why I get that's how
good yeah
so this is some tissue paper I really
like this print is basically woodland
animals with antlers which I guess you
could use all year round but I thought
they were quite Missy so I got those I
also got these because I thought these
would be so lovely
it's Mary Mary again I do love that
brand for cupcakes or any kind of
Christmasy biscuits that I might make
before Christmas Day although to be
honest it's almost Christmas Day now and
I don't have time so I don't know
whether that will happen or not I got
two rolls of that did I get two on I got
three rolls of that and I also got two
rolls of this which I love I actually
wrapped I think it was my grandparents
presence in this it's kind of like cream
with gold metallic like wood effect on
it which is nice I got two of this one
which is ah what's this one kind of just
white little reindeers I think and then
I got plain craft paper because that's
useful and if I want to do some stamping
or something I got another little box
and oh I got two mini ones I don't know
what I'll put in these but I thought
these would be good for stocking
presents all things that are difficult
to wrap and
so there we go that those Christmas
welcome murmurs I mean it's not sure oh
it's not J I also just got some plain
gift tags did I get one of those yeah
that was silly Zoey should have got way
more but three great three gift tags um
or a big bag I did have something
specific in mind for this but it's
actually not big enough
damn it should have gone for the extra
large oh well I can use that for
something I'm sure and then some more
tissue paper but this one's so cute look
at this one it's like Christmas dinner
tissue paper so you've got like the
broccoli and the potatoes and the
brussel sprouts the little sausages
wrapped in bacon how cute is that and
some carrots basically it's all there is
no cute so that my friends is my little
mini paper chase haul did you enjoy that
Nala yeah she's that don't disturb me
I'm watching the TV oh my goodness what
freaking out cheese like no I want to
put my coat on really good pose really
good shoes on I took them off and you're
like now now I'm gonna film you I trust
you so now I've got now I've got a date
it's a date Jay everyone get treated
right cause when are we gonna have our
day - yeah years ago wasn't it and I
asked you in a day yes yes what now
we're having it but I'll be just
question will ya third-wheeling um so
yeah trace here hello
you haven't been here in so long no I've
been in London for a while I know well
Brighton's miss G Holmes Brighton and
your dinner looks really good food oh my
god he started sorry baby yeah it
doesn't have food
it's been hard out there all cozy on the
sofa I got my cozy jumper I've got my PJ
bottoms on I've got a very very sleepy
puppy she almost looks like annoyed like
it's like her resting bitchface when
she's tired it's so funny and this
blanket is like the softest thing I've
ever felt in my entire life and I have
just been for some reason I always get
on to like you know when you kind of
click through YouTube videos and you end
up somewhere you definitely didn't think
you would ever end up I've somehow ended
up looking at pregnancy announcement
videos so I've been like I'm not
pregnant by the way that isn't too like
fuel a rumor um I just you end up like
clicking through and then I was like a
daily vlogger who had posted the birth
of their baby and then I went through an
author announcement and then I saw other
people's announcements and I was like
getting really into the pregnancy
announcements it's so fun though it's
like so many people get so creative with
it but it just makes me an emotional
wreck like I cannot handle like I think
for me I cry more at happy things like
like when people surprise people that
gets me so quickly like I could be
watching it and the next thing I know
I'm just like oh my god my eyes stop
stop my Eyes's go obviously sad things
make me sad too but I feel like happy
things just I can't contain the tears
the tears have been rolling down my
cheeks but it's funny because you're
kind of smiling at the same time you're
like oh my god is this is the cutest
thing ever
um but yeah I know I'm not the only one
that does that you could be on YouTube
for hours looking at like proposals and
like our wedding vows and like
surprising my parents or even like when
people bring home a puppy for like that
other half or something it's like the
most emotional thing ever
so that is why
doing I've been watching people's
pregnancy announcements also edited my
vlog and uploaded that and now I think
I'm going to edit another video so that
I'm like on top of it a little bit more
um but I've also been reading all your
lovely tweets on my tweet or about 24
days ago other because there is only two
videos left for 24 days of zoella and
but it's just crazy that it's gone so
quickly but I'm so glad that so many of
you have been enjoying it and I've had
so much fun doing it so so much fun a
lot of people have kind of asked me why
I decided to do it and I think it's just
because I had so many ideas for December
and it's because I wanted to give
something back to you guys
and I thought you'd like it so I mean it
has been hard I'm not gonna lie
it has been hard um and it does mean
that I haven't fully relaxed for quite a
long time
oh not as under the blanket Lola oh and
it doesn't mean I haven't like properly
relaxed for what feels like a long time
but I am just really happy that you've
all enjoyed it
and that's the main thing um so yeah I
would love to know in the comments what
has been your highlight or favorite part
of vlogmas and your favorite video from
24 days of so ella which is the main

a.m. Christmas morning is the last
vlogmas which will be Christmas Eve and
then there's no more vlogmas vlogmas is

best to put it up at 9 and then people
can kind of get on with their day can't
they and then it's done isn't it it's
all done and then you have to worry
about it um but yeah I'm rambling when

lights I feel like I haven't been able
to watch much vlogmas because i've been

now and I actually just quickly look
through my peer bucks and I found this
how good is this this is by a brand
called hydrate mate like that and it is
a bottle that you refill once a day so
you drink two of these essentially and
it keeps you hydrated so I'm going to
give that a try tonight see how much of
that I can get through but I just
thought I would show you that because I
think that's quite cool also got Gavin &
Stacey Christmas special on TV which I
am so happy about because it is one of
my favorites ever ever ever so I'm
basically going to be sipping my drink
editing some videos and watching
Governors day see so that is pretty much
my day done sorry that it wasn't too
thrilling um but it was just a lot of
driving and a lot of kind of packing and
kind of mundane things I feel like days

don't really even know why I've done
today myself but thank you so much for
watching and I will see you again
tomorrow hopefully be doing something a
little more festive um and give the
