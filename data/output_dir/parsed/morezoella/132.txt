Ella good morning everyone so I look
like this currently after the water
fights yesterday I basically firstly
part like I really want to buff I said
to Alfea all yesterday I can't wait to
have a bath
I'm gonna run it's gonna be so nice and
relaxing and I'm going to catch up on
some YouTube and then we were out at the
beach for a really long time and then
when I got back it was probably about
11:00 and I was like screw it got a busy
day tomorrow let's just go to sleep so I
didn't have my bath woke up this morning
excited for my bath and actually it
didn't seem as hot today so it didn't
seem weird to have a warm bar and we've
got no hot water I'm not sure what's
happened to our boiler it's on this is
no hot water coming out it's like the
burner isn't igniting I don't I don't
know I'm not I'm not a plumber or is it
an electrician I don't know which one
works on boilers I'm not a boiler ition
so I don't know I don't know what's
wrong with it
I can't even bath I'm really sad about
it and we have a meeting at 2:30 which
I'd quite like to be not looking like
this for and especially since yesterday
it was a really hot day I just feel so
gross like I want to shower so bad so I
think we're gonna try and either go to
poppy insurance for a shower or Alfie's
mum and dad's for a shower either way I
need to sort myself out cuz I look like
this currently and we've got meetings so
hopefully we'll get sorted
we're now at Nick and Amanda's I'm about
to have a shower sort this out
thankfully they have hot water I'm all
done Alfie you clean all brush yeah I've
got this out I've got my new boots this
is a sauce I think a sauce this is Zoe
Carson t-shirt a little pair of
high-waisted shorts I am actually gonna
change just a bit too big yeah Anya

pace else yeah I don't know why these
are too big I think they used to fit me
unless I picked up the wrong ones but
yeah
I like really but I think I need to like
get tighter ones let's go get some lunch
before our meeting on our way home we
decided to stop off and get some lunch
but Alfie has just as we're driving
through we're like Ravens bakery we need
to get some chocolate squares cuz
they're the best thing ever and do you
remember the vlog where I said Alfie was
going to get chocolate squares before
and they didn't have any so
Alfie's has gone in now and he's like
how many do you want like Marvin me out
the window I'm like how many is there
he's like loads like tray and then I
thought that's a bit ridiculous I was

figured he might want to try one and
anyone else that's come to the meeting
might want one you never know I do
always have the best meeting snacks I
