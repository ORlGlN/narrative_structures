good morning it feels like a really long
time since I've done like a vlog
remember the last vlog I did it was with
mark and Shawn maybe and when Mark came
to stay I did my lifestyle launch kind
of talking you through the product vlog
but that's not really a vlog that was
more like a sit down video that kind of
sat on my second channel so yeah how are
you it's been a while it's already weird
to pick up this camera I kind of wanted
to not great lighting but I kind of
wanted to document my skin because I
feel like it's looking a lot better I
mean I can tell but yeah I feel so much
more confident in my skin and that's
such a weird thing because I was looking
at so many old photos and both myself
and Joe had really like clear skin up
until the age of about 20 21 where for
both of us it just when looking back old
photos I'm like oh I look so useful and
my skin looks so great and then I mean
I'm happy with it right now I mean I was
happy with it until I looked at old
pictures then I was like damn it I don't
want you to see what's on the floor back
there because there's some very secret
things had a meeting yesterday with SLG
who are the company that I met my
products with and my Ximena brand
manager and my actual manager and my
talent coordinator and my PA there was a
lot of us in that meeting room and that
was like the first meeting that I've
properly done in there and it was really
like cool because although like we moved
in when we move in now like June so it
nearly been two months two months in a
couple of days I feel like I'm only now
like settling and finding a routine in
this house and it's so funny because so
many people like oh you've unpacked now
like it must be crazy like living here
and I think for so long it just didn't
feel real being here and it kind of felt
a little bit like we're on holidays
especially cuz we were having a really
lovely sunny weather and now
I've been here a while I feel like it's
sinking in now and I'm starting to like
settle with it a bit more but also I'm
finding like my little routines and I
didn't think that was a thing before but
now I'm quite aware of like how people
do have their routines in their house
like they will kind of water all their
plants in a certain day or kind of like
turn all the lights off at night or I
know like you get up and you go to a
certain place to do your maker for you I
don't know go to a certain place to do
to to make your breakfast and like all
those things I've sort of been trying to
like figure out and this battery
flushing or sorry knowledge of character
got to know you were dominant so that's
kind of like my little update in the way
of moving we only have like two boxes
left and then not mine selfies so
technically that means no boxes left for
me anyway because I've done all mine I'm
really really happy here like I just
love it so much I feel calm I feel
content I feel like the luckiest person
in the whole entire world and I honestly
just don't think that's ever going to go
away and it's just such a weird feeling
I office Lee likes our old house I did
but like the privacy was not great and I
didn't still a hundred percent safe in
that house hello non-event I'm Godwin us
she'd also farted you know ah so you
just but Nala also loved this house
think there's more places to explore
look why is that oh my god Joe is
currently right have my camera on and
off zooms in that's so strange I need to
put my makeup on Joe's coming he's been
sending me voice notes and what's up of
his uber driver like literally just
talking nonstop and Joe's just like
mmhmm yeah great
quick buddy don't know where PE not
really right rainy miserable day today
but I kind of love it because it's cozy
and because we have this big window but
when it rains on it I find it really
relaxing so yeah so this is going to
sound a little bit crazy but I've been
climbing or my content up until like
January because I want to get really
ahead of myself this year I'm so excited
to do blog mass because you know vlogmas
is like my favorite thing to do ever but
I am NOT doing 24 days of the zoella
this year last year I did it because I
forgot unlike how much work it was and
the year before that I did it I feel
like I didn't have as many projects only
in for that so although it was still
quite stressful because I did 48 videos
in one month I didn't have as many other
project I still have you but it wasn't
as many and then last year I had quite a
lot of projects I was working on and
doing 48 video so this year I'm not
doing it and I hope that's okay
I did say don't let me and I tweeted the
other day and some of you are like no I
really wanted you to do it and I feel
really bad but I was like can I use it
also it's not even that it's a lot of
videos because I know I could do it
because I've done it before and although
it's hard work it's really fun and it's
very rewarding but I'm like I can't
think of like 48 more I can't like so
much 20 lakhs it's like the main channel
girl I can't think of turning for more
videos again I might be able to do more
next year if I can think of some more I
feel like if I
every year I'm just going to run out my
dish I think what I'm going to do is
eight videos in on my main channel in
December which work out at one on a
Saturday and one on Sunday so every
weekend two videos which I thought was
quite nice because then you've also got
vlogmas through the week but let me know
what you think or whether it would be
better do you think for me to do
Wednesday and Sunday I just kind of like
the idea of it being like a weekend of
like videos or tonight let me know let
me know that's what I'm currently
thinking anyway I'm not too sure what
I've done with my hair but I feel like I
look like a man who lives in stone just
pin my hair away one two women using a
little bit of collection lasting
perfection concealer I'm just going to
put that unlike some of the marks I
don't have any like active spots and all
mark on my lip but it's not really what
system mark
so yeah I'm really really happy with my
skin like I say that as I'd like
coated it in concealer but I'm not going
to wear foundation I'm just going to top
this and like blend it in I present
avatar I then use my bare minerals
instead ivory with the brush and then I
just buff it Oh God look good on the lip
do people that go to uni get summer
holidays I feel like they definitely get
Christmas holidays yeah I feel like they
doing if you go to uni let me know
obviously I never went to uni I don't
know these things but I was just
thinking then when I'm doing like doing
my foundation I used to get really
nervous in August about going back to
school because I always felt like once
Olga started the countdown has begun for
back to school even though August is
like the chunk of the time you get off
and we get asked that question quite a
lot like you're enjoying school and I
feel like so many people's answer is
like no I hated it I actually really
loved school I'm not sure if I would
have loved school if I have to go now
though I'm using the Bobbi Brown tinted
eye brightener in the shade light bisque
2 or I use this this is a spectrum bo2
fluffy brush just give a little blend
and yeah I actually really love school
obviously there were times right didn't
I'm sure but I don't I don't remember
them so clearly my memories are all the
good ones could believe it or not it was
a really long time ago now I had all of
my school friends to say the weekend
just gone and it's so nice I didn't talk
it's because they're not like they don't
rob or anything not that that makes a
difference as to whether I should love
it or not but it was just nice to be in
the moment and not logged in we were
like crying with laughter at like old
photos and things it was so much fun and
I think but I checked all our like
notebooks that we used to write each
other notes in and like ten around class
and and we were laughing about how three
of us have read cheston's together and
there was a toilet in literally opposite
the classroom and we would skive off the
French lessons
times but all three of us and we would
go to the toilet offered at the
classroom and we would all sit together
in the classroom the teacher knew your
friend so thinking back from like she
must have known like she could probably
hear us in the toilet like help stupid
were we so funny
oh I'm just bronzing and blushing up
using the Charlotte Tilbury
palette or it doesn't have a name on the
back see this is a simple one I just
love things like that like I love
remembering all times and because there
was quite a few of us it was like some
of us remembered some things and then
others remember something else that I've
completely forgotten so it was really
really fun I'm now using this
highlighter which I absolutely freakin
love it's by Estee Lauder and I feel
like it came in to the bronze goddess
collection this summer but it doesn't
have this is a sample one too and it
just as are n101 a nine six so I don't
actually know what it was called which
is a shame this is pretty much the
makeup look I've been doing every day
just kind of like chuck it on do it
really quickly I haven't really been
spending a lot of time on my makeup I
don't know why I feel like oh my gosh I
feel like I've fallen out of love with
experimenting with makeup I've gotten
into like a routine and a habit and I
need to like sneak some new products and
Thai makeup bag so that I'm not doing
that basically also I found picture well
my eyebrows were a bit thinner and I
feel like maybe it suited me more I
don't know I need to help guide I grow
my brows out a bit not too much but I
have growing them out I'm just not sure
if maybe they see me more when they're a
bit thinner it's hard to tell but yeah
we were reminiscing about school times
it was so much fun and it just made me
think then is like the summer holidays
and whether or not you get a summer
holiday with unique but I'm pretty sure
we do it's been a while since it's done
like a little like chatty
were they were moving gwr em get moving
gr w em
I'm going to use this which is the Tarte
lights camera lashes in like this
amazing mocha dial holographic e
iridescent packaging not actual
crocodile by the way so now why is that
yes like like our crocodile pattern so I
haven't used this mascara before I
actually quite liked it very natural
that'll do donkey but all do so that's
it I literally use like six product and
loosely do I go red do i do nude
incontinent using my little jelly angels
over love it I do my makeup in here even
though I have a makeup vanity table in
our bedroom I supposed to do in here
because the mirror is huge and I like to
do my makeup standing up which is
something I have realized I prefer to do
I don't know why anyone else precise
should you make up something dollop no
even I what I've done there is slightly
overdrawn this side of women it's a
little bit wonky no mine okay messy hair
finished makeup and that's pretty much
all I've been doing for the past two
months is just this makeup nothing on my
eyes bit of mascara still my brows in a
bit bit concealer bit of powder bit
bronzer I love it and I'm really
enjoying it now one thing that is very
exciting if you didn't know already my
eye like so many things are being
released moment I'm so sorry guys please
feel free to not get anything if you
don't want to just watching my videos
honestly is enough for me and I'm not
just saying that I really do mean it you
don't have to go and purchase things to
prove anything to me I just want to make
things that you will like and I just I'm
so aware that there's so much I'm
talking about so I brought out my book
going online going solo last year and
that was
the hardback there but the paperback is
actually being released as you're
watching this today so I'll leave a
little link in the description box how
cute is that
a paperback it does actually look
slightly different from the hardback
look there you go
I just love the color of this so much I
found earlier some mock-up covers in
different colors because I could not
pick I feel like with the first and
second with the blue and then the purple
I was like yeah the blue and purple look
amazing together but what color can I
put with those we went with yellow we
have navy blue week that was my foot by
the way we had navy blue we had yellow
we had pert like a dark purple and I was
like I think orange because it's set in
the autumn time it's set over Halloween
and so I felt like orange was very
fitting that's why it has sparklers on
the front as well which I really really
like actually posted this on Instagram
you again it really confused everybody
because they were like I thought this
had already been released it has it's
just the paperback release but I'm just
reminding you about it so yeah and also
if any of you didn't know this one comes
with a drawn map which we had done and
it's all the little places that penny
and Elliot go to in Brighton or some of
her favorite places and in my mind
penny lives near Lakers Park just in
case any of you that live in Brighton or
no Blazers Park penny lives around this
park basically that's how I imagine
where she and Elliot lives anyway so if
you're ever near Baker's Park have a
little look at the houses around there
because that's where I basically made
penny live within my fantasy book world
so yeah I think I might do a blog post
on somebody's place in because they're
actually my favorite places to go people
at the time people say I'm coming to
Brighton and I'd love your
recommendations of where I should go or
places that I should visit
and a lot of them are actually in girl
online so I might be like a little blog
post or maybe a video just like some of
my favorite places to visit Brighton or
places that I go to that you might like
to visit let me know if you would like
that much yeah these arrived for me a
while ago and I think I know what they
are and I wanted to save it for a blog
so that I could open them with you guys

the whole series I'm so pleased you guys
liked it I'm so pleased that there was
such a kind of important and inspiring
underlying message in there which is
exactly what I wanted to do I wanted you
to read this I wanted you to read about
penny and I wanted you to feel the
things she felt and for you to all feel
less alone and by creating character
that struggled with things that I've
struggled with when I was a teen I
wanted people to read that and to feel
less alone and to feel that they can
overcome something that at times you
feel like you can and honestly that was
my main reason for wanting to do this I
wanted to create a fictional character
that I wish I had read
but when I was younger and I got to do
that and that found you guys so thank
you and also just yeah and also because
this is like the final book in the kind
of trilogy this is where Penny's journey

Alex newer wrestling I met boxing I'm
not that stupid and I have just edited
and uploaded my July favorites and now
for the first time ever I'm cold in this
house
this house is like a sauna and every
room is hot all the time but today
that's not the case all oh my god is a
wind tunnel in here it's freezing the
three windows open oh my goodness these
should be restocked soon actually so
keep your eyes peeled for that oh my
goodness now hopefully it won't be so
cold on me come up to bed so I have a
bar actually are you going to fail
because I kind of want to watch them
film but also another bath so which
one's going to happen first so actually
the boys are going to film their video
tomorrow which means I can't have a bar
but then I said I'm going to go in for a
bath and Joe when I want one and we
actually have two so I'm going to give
Joe this one and I'm going to go in the
one up in my office which I've not
actually had a bath in yet because I
just have a bath in this one I'm
actually kind of excited about it but
for now I'm running Joe's because I
didn't want to risk running them both at

forever so running Joe's got some
bubbles
