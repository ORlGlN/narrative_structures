hello everybody welcome back to my
channel this is actually my second
channel ain't it something exciting is
happening and I cannot wait to share
this with you feeling somewhat
self-conscious right now because I'm
filming in my office that the windows
won't open and I can hear people outside
and I don't live in a very residential
area so I don't know what they're doing
outside but I hope they're not listening
in on my conversation could be very very
awkward as you may assume from the title
of this video some of you probably share
with you that I'm working on for well
over a year now you guys know that I
launched lifestyle which was very new
and very exciting for me last September
it was a lifestyle gifting range now
gifting essentially means that it is
only available around Christmas time and
the new year because it is a gifting
ring therefore it is made in order to be
gifted and during the festive period
therefore you cannot get it for the rest
of the year once it's gone it's gone the
only order at certain quantity so that
is why when things come out at Christmas
you don't often see them again so if you
see it get it if you like it because it
won't stay all year round however
because I absolutely loved doing
lifestyle is definitely a huge huge
passion of mine especially since I moved
house and having my own house and kind
of using the things I have created quite
a lot we decided to do my first
lifestyle all year round range which
means that this range is available all
year round not just at Christmas which
is very exciting however I do have a
some very exciting Christmas products
literally around my feet that I can't
show you yet
but also happening as well so this isn't
replacing Christmas gifting this is just
an all year round kind of lifestyle
range it literally is crazy it blows my
mind how many products I now have or
have brought out like a blow I'm going
to get started and show you because
that's what you clicked on this video to
find out so I'm going to do that okay I
might start with one of my favorite
things obviously I love everything in
the collection otherwise I would have
released it but this is like I don't
know I just think this is the cutest
thing thing I've ever released ever so
it comes in this little box I'm using a
ring like today by the way which could
make this a whole other issue of video
I'm not sure it could be an issue but it
seems okay for the moment it is called
catching trinket ceramics jewelry tray I
live by these things I always have them
next my bed I put them next to guest
beds - because you need somewhere to put
your watch you need somewhere to take
off your like rings and bracelets and
even like little things like Queens just
anything hair pins you know if you get a
bit peckish in the night keep a couple
of biscuits in this on the side of your
bed just meat okay and it has this like
spotty design and it's a cloud and it
have for working eyelashes and it's just
the cutest thing in the world so fill
out the required a file just pulled it
out this box this box was meant to be to
give to people but I'm going to have to
keep this one as well I've catch a few
of these I'll just keep this one - so
here it is it's a little ceramic trinket
tray with foil eyelashes and it's pink
and cream that is the first thing that
we have in the lifestyle collection
which I'm really really happy with I
love it next up we have a little set of
pencils now I brought pencils out at
Christmas but one thing I really really
wanted to do was to put rubbers on the
end because I just find them so useful
and they are like a beautiful baby pink
like this whole range is like gray pink
and gold and it's basically all the
colors that I'm obsessed with right now
so excuse the Europe so I'm very very
happy about that right on point pencils
upgraded the packaging I really like
this it's in like a little like wallet
cardboard wallet and they say things
like hugs and kisses love from yours
faithfully yours truly and best wishes
next up are two little pots I freaking
love these my office has had these in
them for quite a long time and I keep
having to hide them in case they
accidentally film them or after he comes
up here and he's logging and I have this
in the center of my meeting table full
of pens and it just completely threw me
and I had to literally just like chuck
it in a cupboard so now I can keep out
and show it but again we've got this
gold metallic one with eyelashes and
then this has got my little red logo on
it but it looks like a little like mouth
like nice metal you come to pen makeup
brushes plant anything you fancy in
these here's another one this one is
this lovely pink again and it's got lots
of kind of randomized great polka dots
on it so yeah absolutely freakin love
these and you can actually buy these
separately now so before they came in a
set of two for gifting but all year
round you can just plain like I have one
of these at Christmas
that was like a festive one I can reward
it said but I really really wanted one
for my desk and I was like I really want
to be able to make one of these I want
lots of people to
of them they look so cute as decoration
basically it it doesn't really do a lot
it's not paperweight or anything to even
use is paperweight these days
a paperweight still like a thing that
people genuinely need anyways I like
this it's a nice decoration I'm going to
put these all around my office I love
them it's a gold inspire word that's it
any way you want it to so like I should
know have it in the background on my
desk looking pretty this was like quite
the challenge to create without it being
extortionate and I feel like we've done
an amazing amazing job on this I'm
really really happy with it I hope that
any ones that happen in their bedroom or
their office or wherever they want to
put it looks at it and actually does
either feel inspired or want to inspire
this next thing again I am obsessed with
this ladies and gents is the looking
sharp rings and jewelry holder and tray
ceramic ring holder it says I love the
box so much it's so like you know going
to open this box but I do have one down
here look at it if there's not the
cutest thing you have ever frickin seen
like I'm obsessed with cactuses as well
so this couldn't have come at a more
perfect time it's great pick it has gold
foil on it and I can put my rings on it
I can put earrings in here and like
again coins anything that you want to
take off at the end of the day or like
have this like sitting pretty on your
vanity unit or next to your bed or just
where you keep your jewelry I love it
and then I feel like it's not really on
a lifestyle if we don't have a little
bit of stationery in there because you
all know I am more than obsessed with
stationery and you can never have enough
notebook which is why we have this one
I still use lashes notebook which was
great
and it said once upon a time on the
front and on the back it says the end
this one pulled out it can track it yeah
gone then this one still have that
lovely faux leather II feel and it has
de-bossed polka dot on it which feels so
nice and it says wonderful in like a
gold foil and again it's got this little
elastic bit which I just think is
perfect
any notebook especially if it's bulging
with notes I love it
next we have stay on top of your world
stationery book so again last year we
have the little things but full of the
post-it notes etc this year we've done
something very similar and you open it
up like so and you've got all these
different things useful things inside so
you've got the depth busy post-it note
to-do list and you've got some under
there look it's like scalloped at the
bottom line of it sauce to see xoxo a
start
let your two tabs that you can like
stick to things it's the little things
as you can just write on and again
you've got the goal so you've got the
a.m. and the PM on each day and what you
need to be getting done I personally can
live without these they make life so
much easier for brain dumping it helps
it's pretty tough as well and last but
by no means least this is it's the
little things jot it down jotters so you
get two in a pack and you've got this
one which just says is the little things
or all things and then this one which
are also absolutely love but they're
just so good like I am working on like
multiple different projects kind of got
once so I like having these like smaller
little notebooks that you can write in
for things especially when it comes to
like different meetings it's good to
have different
like that and I really like this is
going to sound very sheer but I really
like the space between the lines on the
pages too good amount space so yes
that's those and then we had a cushion
at last time which was the naps fixed
everything attrition and I loved that
and wanted to bring something back very
similar so we have the cloud nine oh I
love it I have an arrow on it I love it
it has like gray like pom-poms and it
has the velvet on the back we also have
easy does it
obviously it's like easy does it but
easy does it if you're feeling a bit
sleepy dozy you get it you get it and
this one which I slip in last look and
these big ones also have the velvet on
the back there root snuggly oh good
