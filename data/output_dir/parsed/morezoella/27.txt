good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 11
I'm not even exaggerating when I say
that getting out of bed this morning was
exceptionally difficult it's really cold
today
and it's so miserable I was really
hoping that we were going to be waking
up to snow because I looked on the
weather app yesterday and it said that
it would snow today and it hasn't so I
don't know I checked on my phone this
morning and it did say snow at 9:00 but
that's in eight minutes time and it's
definitely still just raining also I
don't really know how well snow settles
on rain because I think the wet melts
the snow but correct me if I'm wrong I'm
not like a weather wizard I'm just so
gutted that everyone was literally
making snowman snowman I'm so good at
making snowmen in their garden yesterday
and I thought our time will come Oh oh
my god guys I think it's snowing what
how did I make that happen maybe I am a
weather wizard it's raining and snowing
how is that possible can it rain and
snow at the same time it's snowing guys
it's frickin snowing okay well it's not
gonna settle because it's also raining
so but well uh oh this morning because
we're going to wait rows and we're also
going to get Nala because she stayed at
a Mandarin X last night I think we're
also picking up buzz as well so he's
coming back here for a fun day I just
can't believe last night it was so good
I've never seen edge here and perform
and he is just one of my favorite
singers I just think his voice is
incredible and he did so many songs that
I'm obsessed with like photograph is my
favorite ed Sheeran song and it's not I
wouldn't say it's like one of the most
popular ones like I wouldn't say if you
asked everyone what their favorite ed
Sheeran song is but most people would
say that so I was so happy and so
surprised
a photograph I was like I love it
I'm waiting for Alfie to get out of bed
of course and then we're heading off
I also woke up with a huge spot on my
chin and it's one of those horrible CP
spots that you can't cover so now I've
drawn your attention to it
enjoy the day that's when you know that
is freaking freezing so one of the
reasons that we're dipping into Waitrose
is aid to get some breakfast because I'm
really craving something I really want a
smoothie really craving a smoothie but
also I'm working with Waitrose on a
baking video which I'm very excited
about to promote their campaign
Christmas together
losing the waitress advert I have I love
it they're all in a pub and they all get
snowed in much like what I'm hoping is
gonna happen here and then they all come
together to make food create fun and
have a great day all day and they all
don't know each other is amazing it's a
really lovely advert Christmas is about
being together and coming together and
having fun and one of those things I
think is baking like if you can bake
something around Christmastime everyone
else is gonna really appreciate that so
I am making some like little bauble
looking they're very hard to explain it
looks like they've got fairy lights on
them little cupcakes and I'm gonna make
them gingerbread and cinnamon like quite
spicy with a lovely just buttercream
frosting on the top I'm really really
excited but I do need to come here and
get my ingredients hey we need to run
inside also my very quick because we
need to go get Nala I don't think I can
get out of here I think it's landing on
my hat but it's so right ah he's changed
his car parking spot so he can actually
get in and out christmas is coming
oh look at that camembert okay I think
we should just head straight to the
baking section if I'm on it
so why this oh my god wait do they have
the radio time oh my god we have to get
one of these lovebirds we can see what
yeah we need black treacle there's some
that
plain flour
here we go now we need large eggs
perfect
I need something to decorate the top and
I do think M&Ms are the most colorful
but I do think Smarties would be quite
good as well yeah grab those but then I
also think I'll get a bag of M&Ms as
well oh you don't those nuts
oh just these ones then thank you ah
there's more colourful oh yeah we'll
just get right I mean we'll eat them
little baking powder the greeny one
perfect ground ginger
Browne said I love how I'm just pointing
it out he's grabbing because I've got
this in my hand ground cinnamon mix
spice is that the same as allspice just
grabbed some ground nutmeg and now we're
going to grab some butter it's so funny
because we used to come to this is the
wait trace knew where we use the lip so
we used to come here all the time
because we've been going to a different
one I'm so confused by where we are oh
my god malted are they look so great hey
unsalted butter
I should probably grab two of these
although I always over buy butter when
I'm be currently though we actually
don't at the moment no none at the
moment I always over by the butter but I
don't want to run out especially when
you're doing butter icing just left
Alfie at the checkout because I've just
remembered I don't think we have any
castor sugar and that could have been
quite terrible down the hill okay dad I
picked up a little
what was this hazelnut hot chocolate oh
they're going in there
yes I picked up a little hazelnut hot
chocolate which is delish it's so good
Alfie got himself a latte and ham and
cheese toastie oh yeah we've got some
ham and cheese toastie as well it's not
quite breakfast but I could really eat
how much cheese toastie and then we also
picked up some flowers oh my gosh we
also picked up some flowers for a
Mandarin Nick just to say thank you for
having knowledge night because it was
very last minute and they're really nice
and like very festive it's like red
berries and like Holly really nice
little bunches kind of wanted to get
something for myself but got fuzzy in
the back in a seat belt first hello may
he right heading home all someone's
moving in course not good not a good day
to move in is it I'm very jealous of you
Nala
I'd like to curl up in my very soft
candy cane dog bed by the fire yes
please
a really big one for like a massive dog
I could just curl up in it yeah let's
see oh no no one's there your death dog
into your bed into your bed into bed it
took three attempts but you've got there
in the end
I'm gonna open my chocolate calendar
because I haven't opened it in a couple
of days and I want to eat some chocolate
we're just waiting for Alfie that's why
Poppy's here by the way because we're
filming a video with Alfie he's just
finishing out the eggs right he's just
finishing something else off so right
which ones haven't I opened I don't
think I opened nine did I
oh we did open nine okay here jingle all
the way
what we got I can never work these out
oh no buzzy this one's not yours it's
not the one that you have yeah what is
this oh oh I see it's a reindeer gotcha
num can you tell a Christmas joke no I
know no joke what is that I just can't
work these out right papi yeah you tell
me what that chocolate is this is what I
do every day when I open these it drives
Alfie mad because I eat it without
knowing what it is but I can't work them
out a little Christmas dark I don't know
I don't know what it is I am sorry
sorry no but I don't know guys what do
you think this is any idea like I can't
work out that's a mouth or a beard or if
that's feet or is it this way up
well no it's definitely not that way up
I literally have no clue but I'm gonna
eat it here he is setting up for his
video after want to explain the video
you're making or not honestly he's
making a flip
pointlessblog video video you're using
my Nana and Grandpa's Christmas present
and a tripod I need to go and cover up
this spot which is actually throbbing on
my chin like it's throbbing why is this
happened it's a boy Lee Boyle I'm about
halfway through filming my cupcake video
I'm just waiting for the cake to cool
down here they are I can't even tell you
how magnificent these smell all I have
left to do is ice them and I have made
the icing and I have to say it's one of
the best buttercream icing
I've ever ever made I'm so happy with it
it tastes amazing and then I still
haven't decided what I'm putting on I
think I'm gonna do M&MS because they're
a little bit more brightly colored and
then I've got the chocolate writing pen
that I do need to put in boiling water
to melt it and I'm just now waiting for
Alfie to pop down and do some little
like handheld shots so that you can
actually see me icing the cake it's all
going on I am also going to feed the
doggies but I only have one hungry
doggie here where's your brother where's
buzzy did I mention we had buzz here
when we picked up Nala we picked up buzz
yes I did mention that just rude
Nala spinning as usual oh you don't need
to bark for it that's a bit rude oh now
look this is buzzes nope buzzy no come
on Nala this mate
good god have you ever seen a more
desperate dog for some food
Oh
there you go now the reason that we have
to have burrs and Nala separate is
because she eats hers in about ten
seconds
buz likes to take his time he takes the
food out he kind of puts it on the floor
eats it away from the bowl sometimes
like it's quite chilled she-wolf sit
down and then runs to buzzes Bowl to see
what he hasn't quite finished yet
so we keep them separated and I keep an
eye on her I mean how long do you want
to lick these balls for okay here she
comes
just to check nothing in there and we're
done look at them I feel really cute a
little bit more makeshift and the ones I
found on Pinterest but still good the
best thing about these though is the
taste I've just taken a bite for my
video and I would offer it literally I
need Alfie to try it on here what's
happened over the filming yeah Alfie
just everything that was nothing that
bad I'll figure ate the whole piping bag
mouth and eating it what you have film
in it wasn't no but it had a lot in it
are these like the best cupcakes you
think I've ever made like where would
you rate them on like all the things are
baked no very soft right hmm very good I
wasn't going to be in the hole there
what you saying I'm not the biggest fan
of gingerbread no and they are quite
gingerbready
but I do really like them how do you
want I just add some sushi
finishing up there well they said I did
you see this I would say I'm trying what
you think to me I've done pumpkin spice
that do you I have actually baked these
before but they didn't taste this good I
don't know what's different
yeah I must have like mixed it for
longer or done something different icing
sugar as well oh yeah and the icing
because it is the best icing of ever
made like vlogmas panic because my vlogs
are always so long and I think that
people expect them to always be a
certain length and then it terrifies me
if I think I haven't filmed enough
tomatoes a bit what I'm starting a vlog
here today you haven't even started I've
been shooting a special video oh he has
been doing a lot all day like I haven't
really seen you since and everything um

when Christmas is gone but I was gonna
put a Christmas tree in our bedroom that
was full of like food ornaments and like
loads of them but I just haven't got
around to doing it so right now there's
not really a tree that those can go on
there may be a one-day conservatory the
other one in there okay that one's on it
purple
I guess I have to get used to it because
when we have children they'll want to
decorate the tree yeah when I was
younger we used to buy sounds a bit
weird like now there wasn't very many
buddy built up over the years we just
probably and I used to pick one new
ornament every year oh yeah that's nice
so then now if you go to mom and dad's
like now this one is laying but you
picked classy ornaments like let's be
honest your mum definitely had some
input like all the ornaments go together
