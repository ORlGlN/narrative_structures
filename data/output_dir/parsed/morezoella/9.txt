Wednesday and its 7th and I'm back up in
my office
going through more CDs and doing some
more work stuff currently trying to
transfer all the footage I have any
meetings I've already filmed on to an
external hard drive I used lots of new
makeup today that I've never tried
before I think I've maybe gone a bit
maybe a bit OTT but I like what I've
used I used a Bobbi Brown Foundation use
the new color pop eyeshadow palette I
use the new benefit mascara and I used a
berry M lip kit I like it I like it's
very hot in this office though so I'm
gonna take off my my jumper miss working
up here I really like my office I'll
still probably use it a lot like I still
work from home on some days but yeah I
do love my office up here this lipstick
is so dark it didn't look like this on
the packaging I'm not gonna lie not
feeling it it looked like a really light
nude but it's actually come out a really
dark nude like almost like dark brown
okay so anyway myself and Althea are
heading off to a internet technical kind
of meeting in a better he's already gone
because he had a meeting before so I'm
gonna meet him in town before the second
meeting and then we're gonna get another
office update I'm gonna do some editing
and do some CV reading and then some
other bits and pieces that I need to do
and then I'll probably vlog on the way
to I'll probably vlog on the way to the
office
Jono guys I lost complete track of time
and I hate being late in this Paula

big please don't make Instagram account
for my coat color guys it's a very good
use of your time sunny bring on spring
I'm here and look what I just found
under the seat
who seen that look where me a mark by
these and their moldy my car is like
clean and tidy by the way these must
have just been under a seat
they don't look good but they smell good
I'm actually here before Alfie so I win
there we go good morning everybody it's
not Thursday and oh yeah there we go it
is Thursday and I was up very early this
morning because I drove our fish the
train station at half past six it was
pitch black the moon was still out and
it was absolutely for a reason so I've
been up for a fair while has shower got
ready done my makeup and now we are
having a website content meeting
upstairs in the office which I'm really
excited about because we want to try and
relaunch the website in the summer like
obviously a lot of stuff has to change
and it has to be built and we need to
hire people but this is like our first
initial content planning session you
want Reno all pretty post-its
cute pens and colored sharpies
I know I'm actually quite pleased with
my rainbow Sharpie drawers I like them
so we've got these boards and I thought
we could do one for each month and then
maybe have one that's like loads of
ideas and then we can kind of pick them
off and put them in which month we think
would be good yeah
so I think we finished our boards I'm
gonna give you a brief look at them
you've got places lifestyle conversation
this is like overall what we want the
website to be and then we've got Beauty
food and style which is your favorite
board guys yeah like maybe these places
carries his lifestyle conversation yeah
I think mine is either lifestyle or
conversation or food yeah so we're
feeling good we've got loads of ideas it
was kind of more of a bit of a brain
dump which i think is great because now
we can go to these boards and we can
remember the things that we came up with
and the things we really want to do yeah
so much to do so much to do if any of
you have anything you would absolutely
love to see on the blog or you'd love to
see me write about or not me write about
someone else who's maybe knows a little
bit more about the subject do let me
know in the comments we are completely
open to suggestions these are all just
kind of ideas at this stage so yeah let
me know in the comments what things you
would absolutely love to read about it
can be anything at all
right I've jumped in the car and I am
now going in to see mark I'm excited for
that I feel like I've had one of those
weeks where unless I doubt the house and
go and see my friend I'm gonna go crazy
so I booked off this afternoon and
decided to go and see him spend some
time with him I think we're going to go
and see insidious which I'm really
excited about because I love horror and
insidious for me when I watched that
first film all God all learn a driver
just
nearly crushed when I watched the first
insidious film I was sugar like that
terrified me and then as I got a bit
older and as I got a bit more used to
the films they won't as scary but still
very scary I think it's the fourth one
yeah I think this is the fourth one is
something about the last key but I
proper into the storyline now so I need
to know what happens although I don't
remember how the end of the third one
finished so I think I need to like look
that up before we go and see it but
there's also another film in the cinema
at the moment called like the which the
something house the something door I
didn't ever begin to the w and that
looks good as well so I don't know you
and actually to be honest I could watch
the greatest showmen for a third time if
that you know if that was an option I
wouldn't say no it's a really nice day
as well I'm in a really great mood and
the content planning meeting was so fun
this morning I love times like that
where you can all just get together and
like throw ideas around have a real like
great obsession and I'm so visual but
that's what is going on in my head and
then to be able to put it in front of me
and live cancer is very satisfying to to
let me know you feel that sort of person
I love I just love being able to see
happiness going on in my head out front
of me it's my favorite thing it almost
makes me feel like a weight has been
lifted like I can see everything a bit
clearer and out because life information
is now out okay I'm done all right let's
get out of here where am I going
which battle says that was the vibe the
theme we've ordered some lunch
I'm very excited about it yes so we've
gone for a wild word wild woods so it's
a new it's a new it's a new restaurant
and honestly you're gonna die that's why
I've over ordered so you can just try
stone Wow look at her this is what I've
been watching every single night like
it's crazy but it puts me off ever
wanted anything done watched by the way

insidious fall
I need to call me watch insidious three

okay so it's not gonna make any sense
like it you don't need to watch it no so
this is before all three of them so this
is right the beginning with the old lady
yeah
what is the scary film with the kids in
there that's paranormal activity isn't
it the kids and the grandma oh that's
some paranormal activity

back to their grandma's house and the
grandma is really scary

everyone's like oh I don't like it it's
shaky and nothing happens to the end but
the actual storyline a parallel parallel
War my inhaler Paranormal Activity is
great oh did you not just see that you

that film story Oh person we haven't
talked like I forgot her to use it story
over substance the story was great
pleased about the story I'm not gonna
lie
so who was the fucked up thing with the
key hard overall massive massive
spoilers aren't they but yeah I really
enjoyed there it is not my favorite of
the insidious quadruped
I said to myself to a trilogy trilogy a
trilogy it's not my favorite but the
story was really strong and there was
really creepy bits but I didn't feel
like there was that many scary bits oh
it's not just me being insane I think I
so I do this thing where I if I am a bit
scared I look to I make it look like I'm
looking at the screen but I'm actually
not I'm looking down at the seats like
in front of the screen and I reckon I
did that about like six times yeah so
it's like it's scary like jumpy scary
around six times yes it was more like
the actual I liked the actual stories
yeah like I'm gonna I'm gonna turn this
off in a minute and properly like pick
marks brains because that confused me a
lot and I don't want to give away any
spoilers but yeah I was really it was
good it was really good yeah I really
enjoyed that I do want to watch them all
good now if you know me you know that
once I started getting cozy and it's the
evening and the fairy lights are on and
we're watching a program
I've got about how long would you say
Mark Taylor fall asleep Oh a good seven
minutes a good seven minutes so I'm
being sensible because it is a fair
drive back to you old Brighton and even
I really enjoying this program and
having the best time I need to sell
because I'm tired
it's not safe to drive when you're
sleepy
so yeah exactly exactly so Mark's gonna
take me down to my car thanks so much
for today I've had the best time as
always I know oh I tell you what didn't
make make it a bit nicer watching the
laughing compilation just me and Mark
laughing nothing else it is so funny
like I commend you to watch it and not
even Smurfs yeah right so I'm gonna end
my vlog here for tonight I'll probably
vlog tomorrow but for tonight goodnight
good morning everybody it's now Friday I
had the worst night's sleep last night
after watching that horror film and I
messaged luck this morning and he also
had nightmares so that's good when
you're sleeping alone in a house LC is
currently I think on his way to Paris
for lunch he's doing a three breakfast
lunch and dinner in three different
countries which I mean he's just crazy
let's be honest we all know this by now
so I have no idea what time he's gonna
get in tonight or or from which country
I have no idea I'm currently heading to
salt my eyebrows out because myself and
Alfie going away next week into maps
today which I'm really excited about we
were as I said I think in one of my
other videos we were meant to go last
year but clashed with us moving into a
house so we didn't get to go so I cooked
it for us in November I booked it in
November for Valentine's so I'm really
excited actually
I don't really go too
I like recognized
I don't mind doin up around lots of
people but I find it quite intimidating
whenever I call my phone and it's not
like I love meeting people but I think
it's mostly justice there's a group of
people that are like screaming like
shouting my name across town or like
like giggling and stuff for like
following me around I find that so
intimidating what I'm complaining
I get quite like not okay or I'm just
but I feel like my heart beating and I'm
like I get really I think scared scary
situation and I don't feel like that
when I'm with somebody else but when I'm
on my own I just find that quite hard so
I don't often do
outings to somewhere like town anyway
like I might go to like a supermarket on
my own or somewhere that's a bit quieter
but I never go into town alone
I don't think I ever have to be honest
but it's mine I need to get the brows
done I've got no other choice so it is
what it is I personally would never
follow somebody I would kind of think
all their you know going about their day
if we walk past each other or make eye
contact or I know there's an opportunity
to say hi I would but I wouldn't
actively follow somebody for a long
period of time and that's actually
happened to me quite a few times that
I've been on my own and I've just found
it really
intimidating and a bit scary so I think
because of that really put me off going
anywhere on my own because I don't feel
that I can turn around and say oh sorry
I don't really like being followed like
I just don't feel brave enough to say it
because I don't want people to think I'm
being an asshole even though I'm not and
it's coming from a good place and it's
literally just me not enjoying being I
don't really know many people though and
enjoy being followed in that sense but
yeah I think that's probably why but I
do need to try and shake that because I
can't live like the next coming year is
not going anywhere
which i think is a bit sad because no
one's no one's doing it to frighten me
or make me feel like that but it does it
does make me feel like that I'm here so
these are the before oh I don't have any
makeup on today I think I might from a
video later so I didn't want to put
makeup on for it to get ruined when I
got my brows done so here's the before
as you can see um growing in places that
eyebrows just shouldn't grow like your
eyelids fingers crossed I come back out
with much better brows just got back I
was on the phone to my mum the whole car
journey back so I thought I would show
you my brows once I'd stopped and got
off the phone but look how much better
they look oh I love them when they've
been done that's just so much easier to
fill in oh love it right go inside eat
some lunch and do some work a bit I've
come up to the office and I'm now just
going through the marketing copy of some
of the products that are coming out this
Christmas marketing copy basically means
the description of the product that is
on the packaging and it's also the
directions for use and contents and all
the text that you will see on a product
so I then go through and check Oh
we're just drew on our feet Gucci
t-shirt oh oh no the one day where I was
like oh I'm gonna wear Alfie's t-shirt
because I like how so much more baggy is
this pen confuses me look you think it's
gonna be coming up that end no it's
coming up the end okay it's fine I'll
see I'll get it off this is a bit biro
how long have we already been doing this
range for now soon yeah
maybe since summer at least summer last
year so a lot of these names and
descriptions and things we've already
been through but this is like before it
goes to pre-production which means that
they go off and they get printed and
then they come back and then we see what
the product looks like and then make any
other changes before it goes into mass
production which is when there's nothing
you can change once it goes into mass
production that's like thousands and
thousands of products being made so you
just want to make sure that there's
nothing that's wrong or if I want to add
anything else into the descriptions and
I add them in here before it all goes
off but yeah also helps with all the
like final designs and things because if
there's a name I'm not sure about in
fact I do find the names harder and
harder every year I'm excited for you to
see this range for Christmas as you know
you'll probably be seeing it around
August I'm so although it feels like a
long time to wait it's not too long and
we'll start getting like mock-ups and
samples actually we've already seen
mock-ups started seeing some mock-ups
but we'll start to see samples come
through so maybe I'll show you a couple
of those to get you a bit excited I
don't want to like prematurely excite
you all and then it'd be annoying that
you have to wait so long but then at the
same time I want to show you more of the
process so can you let me know how that
sits with you do you like things as a
big surprise reveal or do you want to
see more of like the range starting from
the very beginning and going all the way
through knowing it's gonna take a while
before you can actually get your hands
on the product because personally I like
to see things developed from start to
finish
I find that is so fascinating but it
does mean
and that nothing is a surprise so let me
know featuring a huge selection of
nourishing wine down beauti treats to
relax see them pamper featuring huge
selection are we bringing back
gingerbread in this wonder hand
yeah gingerbread and then reach yeah
