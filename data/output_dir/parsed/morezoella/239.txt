good morning everybody today I am having
a meeting with my editor Amy you may
have seen her in some of my old lottery
out-of-breath I've just went up two
flights of stairs
oh you think getting a dog and going on
regular walks with making you off it
turns out that's what happens so I'm
just waiting for Amy now my office is
really messy look at all these things
that I need to put away not as here are
you gonna set up here with me and Amy
today so I'm as you may know if you've
been following me on twitter my twitter
is at zero for any of you that aren't or
didn't know that I am answering a few
little questions about book to girl
online too and a lot of you are very
excited for it which makes me very very
happy
Amy's been coming to my house now every
week for the past January February March
April for months um Murphy on Wednesdays
where we sit and we have like little
picnics here on the floor I actually
need to get my act together and get some
nice things up here before she arrives
and we essentially spend the day bashing
heads and writing the book together so
it's very exciting I love Amy I love
working with Amy she's amazing we've got
online I also had an editorial
consultant who helped me get everything
down on the page and as it was my first
novel it was all very daunting and very
scary but I feel as though I'm kind of
learning as I go along so now it's just
me and Amy so it's just me and my editor
for book two I do really enjoy my time
with Amy though because she obviously
knows what she's doing she is a pro at
this
and I am kind of learning as I go along
so but it is definitely um the most fun
thing I am doing right now and have been
doing it's so exciting
every week I'm like super excited I've
decided on
all the themes and the storyline for the
second book it's gone through that we've
gone null stop barking the dog next door
um I added some new characters and I
don't really know how much to give away
on my second Channel
I've been reading chapters that I've
written to Alfie um to see what he
thinks sounds like you should be filming
this like this is really fun like you
should be showing this process so I
guess I just need to find out what I can
kind of reveal to you I kind of want you
guys know everything because I'm so
excited about it
Nala but I know that that would be
stupid because I'll just end up reading
the entire thing to you before it's out
and then what's the point but um wait
stop it we I don't know what I can tell
you without giving away the book I don't
want to give you the name I don't give
you a title it's not called girl on line
to a lot of you my Twitter feed is like
is it called girl almighty or does it
have a different title it's not called
girl on line two that's just kind of
what Amazon puts up pre-order I'll leave
a link for the pre-order underneath this
video actually and you can go on over
and pre-order if you like as you know
I'm not literal genius I did not study
this at school is just a passion of mine
and a passion can get you so far but
when it's been kind of published and
that on shelves in a lot of bookstores
it's not the most kind of professional
way to do it um even like the format
like aiming knows the format and like
how it's supposed to look on a page
whereas I sit and type and type and type
and type and type I think if I didn't
have a me the book would honestly be
like as thick as this this thick is this
airport is it was known for I'm getting
confused of actual airports and actually
have all my notes in here we've got some
old characters back and we have some new
characters and the book has a very
obvious general theme which I could give
away but by telling you the title which
I might do at some point I definitely
will
I'm just waiting a me
I should probably get some sweets
together and stuff so yeah for a minute
now I thought she was hiding behind the
door I think she might be here though
okay I think Amy's here now so I'm gonna
stop rambling and I'll film a little bit
of the meeting from what I can film
because obviously I don't want you guys
to know exactly what happens at the end
in the middle and at the beginning
wearing like a cloak today look look at
Nala she always finds a little sun spots
to sleep in you enjoying that Nala bear
but yeah it's book day today normally I
don't film them because it's literally
just us at typing and it's not very fun
but I kind of want to really cuz I'll be
able to look back on this and also think
it's interesting for you guys so that is
what I'm gonna do and this is something
is that all of a bonus sent me for my
birthday which I might actually still
just hang up in here okay Amy say it now
so I have to go by Amy's here you
actually have quite a good tan as well
look at your arms and she also brought
this which is from Michael calm calm
because I always mention his app because
I use it and I find it amazing so he
says thank you for mentioning it and
here's a little box of goodies so he
sent me a little panda nano blocks does
anyone else have these because I've seen
them in shops and the Panda looked
really cute and also when I bought Dacia
Lego kit at Christmas I ended up making
it which is very selfish of me it was
like I think it was Ariel's boat and
Palace yeah it was it was fun to make
and then I think Matt dissembled it
I'm chucked all in a bag to take back
with him and then to rebuild it with
Darcy
that sounds really mean of me I did have
her with me she just wasn't as
interested or I also have sound a very
west country then and GM bees or green
or black g GM bees green and blacks then
salted caramel chocolate which we can
eat later
YUM green and blacks organic chocolate
amazing
he know he knows what keeps me calm
chocolate and also his book calm calm
the mind change the world this looks
very cool I shall definitely help you
having to give that a read and a little
stick we think this is to light the
candles right oh wait there's a hole in
it
Michael what's the stick for is it to
light the candles welcome out to try
this later on or is it like something
that you're supposed to you know like
little things that you're supposed to
like keep that bring you calm
imagine if it's like something sacred
we'd like end up burning it like like
the candles and also this which looks
amazing neon I love that brand the
candles are super cool organics
essential sleep kit three intense
products with the power to help you
sleep which actually matches Amy's dress
very nicely so thank you that's awesome
very cool and we can build this
productive productive book day also very
exciting this is Amy's book the potion
diaries which also goes lovely with your
dress today Amy well I do you know I do
try and explain explain the book for the
viewers well it's a young adult fantasy
book and my publisher describes it as
The Hunger Games Meets The Princess
Diaries but basically it's about a young
Alchemist who is trying to save the
princess who's been poisoned by a faulty
love potion it sounds amazing it sounds
like a fairy tale yeah it's really fun
and it's kind of set in the modern world
so it sort of really hopefully it's
really relatable so yeah totally
opposite to get online basically there
are no unicorns or mermaid no time are
in the portal though you should start
putting a Kwanza moment you can get
online - realness so yeah I'm gonna give
this a read update I think I'm getting a
cold or I have hay fever because I've
got all the windows open but I don't
really get hay fever that badly if I get
it at all I'm not really sure if I get
it or not which is a weird thing to say
I've never had it as a child but Amy did
say you can just kind of
so I don't know whether that's happening
or getting cold either way I have been
sniffling away we are eating some treats
down there
the great stone that great though do
they they're not very green I think
they've had their bed set they do taste
nice
I am currently typing up chapter 11 so
that is how far along we are we do have
quite a tight deadline though don't
worry me a little bit a little bit so
I'm writing this up and then I'm going
to send it to Amy I just said to Amy I
write and way too much I'm like and and
and that's the blog post writer in me
yeah and the exclamation marks I keep
putting exclamation mark after
everything like like everything is so
exciting oh my goodness so I'm having to
go through a room of those but it's all
a learning curve it's very exciting
Amy's packing up that she's leaving it
is 4 o'clock now and I've just finished
chapter 11 so we're well on the way we
really only have how many more words
several thousand a lot a lot more words
to go but it's good it's shaping up
nicely are you doing nyle are you just
watching some YouTube are you watching
some YouTube was that you she's like ah
you're distracting me I just watched a
funny old bloopers video of me and Tanya
when we did our pamper video I don't
know if any of you I think it's called
girls night in I just watched the
bloopers Fricks I don't really do
bloopers on my second channel anymore

bloopers in the main channel but it was
very funny makes me miss blooper videos

from the restaurant they charge you like
a couple of pounds or something like
that until every to your house but we
live too far out we're not in the
blanket but your mummy isn't it yeah we
can get whatever generally one yeah

I heard Minnie and I have absolutely no
idea how any other card get in here it's
just like just walk past it and it's
