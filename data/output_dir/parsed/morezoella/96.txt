what is that good morning everybody and
welcome to vlogmas a chance
we're into double digits it's official
the month Oh
the month is just disappearing before my
very eyes
I love December so much I genuinely get
really sad when it starts to disappear
so I was up this morning
editing getting stuff done it's lighting
of terrible it's time now to feed this
one which is why she's literally
following me around like my little
shadow I am going back to where I was
literally just over 24 hours ago because
I am spending the day with my friends
from school I am still here spending the
day with my friends from school we take
every year we do Secret Santa this year
I have my friend Alex who I've actually
known the longest I have known Alec
pretty much my entire life I've known
how to both babies wait wait good girl
burnin so I have got her prezis I need
to wrap them actually oh no I don't have
time to wrap so I need to set off at
about half ten eleven in order to make
it in time for like one 1:30 I need to
stop driving everywhere I'm going to
have a couple of days at home at least
but then I do need to go back to
Wiltshire to spend time with my family
for Christmas too but we still haven't
decided days we're gonna do that
I feel like December isn't La Mina it's
so annoying I just want December to be
like super long and for everyone to not
live so far away at the moment I am
editing my video for today because I
didn't get to do it last night even
though I said oh it's okay I'm going to
edit some videos I didn't I actually
just fell straight to sleep
fresh out the shower and I'm about to
start my makeup this is what I'm going
to wear today this is a dress from ASOS
I really like it
got some tights and then some boots
these are also a
and then just like this choker thing
which is also a sauce basically gone
aces crazy all done I am feeling so much
more normal now it's so weird how having
a day in your pajamas and not doing your
makeup can be just what you need but
also make you feel so gross at the same
time I don't know how to explain it but
if you know what I mean you know what I
mean so I am going to wrap my friends
presents basically we're doing Secret
Santa as I said this morning I've got my
friend Alex this is what I got her I
thought I would just show you now
because by the time this goes up she
would have already opened it so I bought
this this is from Anthropologie this is
a bottle opener and I just bloody loved
it it's mistletoe I also got her the qat
a day because I love this and I just
feel like she would really like it and
then I also got her this mug god I hope
I'm going to be able to wrap this back
up again just because it is so cute it's
like festive but without being like too
festive and it's got a gold handle ice
really really liked that and then my
friend Emma who I feel like the last
time you saw her did I film last year I
can't remember but two years ago she was
pregnant with her first little boy
called Billy and he just had his second
birthday so I bought a couple of little
bits for him as kind of like a second
birthday Christmas or I need to take the
prices off everything damn it
so I got this really cute little hat
from Zara how adorable is this this
adorable little shirt it's so cute and
then these little gray corduroy trousers
I basically can live my life if I carry
a see-through Emma because she has a
little boy and I don't get to buy baby
clothes that often so I was just like oh
my god if I had a little boy I would put
him in this which is why I got it
so got those things for him it's also
Emma's birth
I feel real sorry for her because it's
her birthday her boyfriend's birthday
her first babies birthday Christmas all
in like the same month and her baby is
due very close so she's also pregnant at
the moment with another little boy who
is June very very soon so that is a lot
of birthdays and Christmas all rolled
into one but I also got her this for her
birthday which says escape the ordinary
and it's a Kate Spade journal which I
thought she would like and then for the
new baby I've got these baby milestone
cards I have this which oh my god is
just the cutest thing ever it's from the
white company and it's a little like
their winter kind of outdoor suit to the
zips from top to bottom and then you
might have seen this in one of alphas
vlogs because we got them out because
they were so cute and tiny but I got
these from baby Bowden and they are so
adorable
look at this oh my god I'm not gonna lie
seeing things like this makes me want a
baby so much I'm not actually that
broody I mean I say that I'm about to go
and spend time with my pregnant friend
and her little baby so maybe I will be
after today but seeing things like that
does make me quite Rudy I have to say so
yeah those are all the presents so I'm
going to wrap them up now but I bought
all this really cool like wrapping in
home scents and because I suck at you
wrapping presents I'm doing it the quick
way and using like gift tags and tissue
paper and little sacks to do it so let's
get started
Hey huh why what are you doing are you
doing I can't go ah look what Alfie did
he went out and got lots of bits and
pieces for me to take to my friends
because I was worried I wasn't going to
have time to go and do it before I had
to set off so he's gone and done it for
me because he's just the cutest
I just realized I forgot to show you
what I got from that pug and puffin
shopping bath
I got Nala a new harness I hope you come
and see it come and see what I got Nala
this soft Christmasy darkness feel it
it's so fluffy underneath
I honestly think she'll love it she's
going to love that with the matching
lead and then the lady was kind enough
to give us some little treats like treat
samples how good is that I want to put
this on her and see what she looks like
let me see you let me see you ah same
shalini maybe if you give her one of
these

head oh do you know I'm really I'm going
