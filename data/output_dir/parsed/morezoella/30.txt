treat Nala Sookie that's the view and
the beautiful day we're having just in
case you were all wondering Alfie's in
like full-on work mode where he can't
hear anything I just started feeling
quite peckish for something sweet
because we all know I have a sweet tooth
and I remembered that we have a delivery
this morning from the lovely people at
dum-dum Donuts
who as you guys know we absolutely love
and they've done some Christmas themed
Donuts and they look incredible if
simply gave us this huge bag I think
those two boxes I think it this one out
look at these all the little reindeer I
think me and Alfie are gonna do a little
taste test because how are you supposed
to actually just have one I want to try
all of them because they will no doubt
all have different flavors in them he's
like a little double donut a little
snowman double donut this looks like
it's got almonds on it the star looks
cute present a little Christmas tree one
and another little present mmm
if you had to pick one of these to eat
which one would you pick I actually
don't know which one I'm the most drawn
to I think the star because it has
coconut on it and I love coconut but
also one of these because these look a
little
like the zebras and you guys know that
the zebra Crona is my fave okay
we've we've moved location we're taking
this very seriously we are going to try
a little bit each one which makes me so
happy
are you hungry I'm actually really
hungry but this kind of stuff doesn't
fill me up
oh this fills me up like so quickly
because it's so sweet actually a bit
worried that I'm not going to be able to
sample now my mama don't like you she
likes everyone all right first one you
you do the others you cut her strongly
it's looks like a cronut very excited
right down the middle I can't eat half
of that no not Ian hope I just want to
see what it looks like okay I just cut
there oh my god this looks
it's a cronut this is Deborah cronut
Cheers oh no don't lose that bit cheers
yes you stuff that coffee mm-hmm heart
of each donut yeah we are
did you ever do that thing when you a
donut where you have to not let your
lips yeah the star which has coconut on
the top so I'm interested to know what
what's inside this one hasn't it
there's something good in there hmm
cheers Cheers
I like that one I could eat that all day
mm-hmm because does it's just vanilla
it's nice and chilled I could just wash
it mm-hmm you pick the next one like my
hair's grown so much faster this time
like it like I've got long hair again
it's not sure anymore
I miss 2014 so Ella I don't have your
long hair I miss you in fact I miss you
miss your dip dyed hair when you just
used to have brown hair with blonde than
water
oh oh oh my god the big bother we're
going for Gertrude I wonder if it's
major in the top Alan's the bottom no in
the bottom there she's got on there
literally I put me bum hole looks
amazing
look at that but it's my term that we
get really bet you could fit that rule
in your mouth no I don't think I could I
try this is my attempt my actual attempt
ah all I can get the top bet that is
good mmm that would get a gym Bell this
but I mean nine doughnuts today could
you really enjoy like having that
massive bear in your mouth was that
enjoyable more chopped Oh imma do need
that oh you stop cutting me a bit now or
is this my bear Alfie's gone from
cutting tiny bits to just cutting the
donut in half okay oh yeah you went for
that one mmm that's nice classic
let's try the Rudolph he looks key yeah
I think this looks like toffee he looks
cute in whatever he was you know didn't
uh no sir toffee no I don't think I'm
gonna be the biggest fan of that that's
right
toffee you're right we may not be a food
taster
I think that's oh sorry I think that one
and that one is the same as what we've
already tried so I say we try that shiny
one yo that looks so great you know I'm
doing well my god Alfie it's freakin
gingerbread sorry I'm so excited
I think it's gingerbread mmm-hmm that's
really good
Oh knowledge sit down here like that's
my favorite one
hands down hmm we've got Christmas Eve
zebra and two of the others which one is
your favorite either that one or the big
snowman I like the malformed
hmm how many just show them you know
sometimes you get donuts with nothing in
the middle
look how much you get in the middle of
these like they ain't in June on the
inside which let's be honest is
everyone's favorite bit of the day very
pom upon me high five because I don't
touch your daddy that was corny fingers
cuz I've been licking - me as we've been
going and you haven't you've just been
leaving yours to get sticky but I don't
get with my gosh I mean if you have a
no-judgment zone drink she goes are
there
well she drinks out the water board
mouth over the whole thing and squeeze
it you drink it she goes and the bottles
like comport I'm being nice I'm just
pointing out in the floor so that you
can improve on that man oh wow so you
can improve on wow this one is very
bright though this morning I didn't
really explain what I've been doing up
to this point but I woke up edited the
vlog I've been doing a little bit of
cleaning and tidying in the house
because it gets very out of hand when
there's two of us daily vlogging we kind
of just dumping things leaving them
thinking well sort that out in a bit and
then before you know it the house is a
little bit of a mess so that's what
we've been doing this morning and it
also kind of prompted me to want to give
my wardrobe a little bit of a sort out
so I've come up to the dressing room and
I think you can help me I've got some
things here that I need to put away and
this is my jumper stash which I think we
can all agree is a bit much like I love
my jumpers as much as the next person in
fact I think I've said this before but a
jumper is probably my favorite thing to
wear ever I just love jumpers but I do
think I have too many and then I have
hoodies here and like Zener jumpers so
like the whole jumper selection is a bit
March and then this is t-shirts and then
this is like strappy tops shirts place
suits and then trousers that aren't
jeans I think actually I have too many
of these as well so I need to sort those
out so that's what I'm gonna do
where can I put you off I do that oh you
can see me perfect starting this end do
I wear this job
yes do I wear this jumper yes do I wear
that one oh I haven't yet actually it
still has the label in it why is it
sticking mmm I'm gonna make two piles
one witches throw away because it's like
discolored and looks really bad another
one which bears for charity and then
potentially one that's like to take to
some homeless shelters or something like
there's always someone that needs
something I'm trying to be very strict
with myself do you ever get in those
moods where you're like I can't throw
anything away everything has sentimental
value I refuse and then sometimes you
have moods where you're like nothing
means anything to me and I'm just gonna
get rid of it that's the kind of mood
I'm in which is why I've decided to come
up here and do this because those are
the days I know I have to sort my
wardrobe out otherwise nothing ever gets
thrown away
oh I know because this color looked
awful on me I don't know why I always by
this color every time I think this color
will look lovely on me I can make this
work
it's like a beige salmon and I think
it's because it's so close to the color
of my skin it makes me look really ill
so that can go to charity really
interesting shape do you not think this
is quite a strange shape like it looks
quite sure I'm very okay I'll give it a
try
I wore this so much this is my Jack
Wills cardigan I just don't really wear
it anymore
no things like this I feel like I don't
need to keep in my wardrobe all year
round so I'm going to fold that and pop
that away I've definitely made some
space because I have a lot down here so
I'm happy about that
I'm now gonna start this side
moving swiftly on to trousers now I have
a lot of trousers and I don't think I
wear them or in fact I know I don't wear
them all okay love these although I
haven't worn them I actually bought
these after I wore these on a photo
shoot because I loved them in the photo
shoot but I haven't had the right
occasion to wear them but I'm gonna keep
them anyway because I do like them and
also these green flared ones I also
really like
not these these are kind of summer
trousers now though I have quite a few
of these three-quarter length I reckon
you could still get away with wearing
those in winter these are definitely
summer ones but they're not clots so if
I keep a pile of clots ah maxi skirts
yeah like them although it's not Remax
he's got weather right now so
this is so much better and so much more
manageable happy with a lot of empty
Anna's this is good because I have
things to hang
now joining the conference call for work
I'm really happy with how the Wardrobe
oh that's great
myself and puppey are having art nails
done tonight you may notice I haven't
had anything done to my nails in a
really long time and I've actually been
really good with my nails if you are a
longtime follower you know that nails is
not something I ever ever do or look
after all go and have done but I have
actually been really good recently and
I've been like actually making an effort
and like I mean not me but like getting
someone else to make them look nice but
they've not been looking their best in
fact this is probably the worst they've
looked in like a good few months so
we've got someone coming to the house to
do my fingers my toes and Poppy's
fingers as well so she'll be here in a
minute
and that usually tends to take like all
evening so I feel like from here the
vlog could get wild
I've really neglected the Christmas
puzzle I got so good look look at all
this I did and then I just got too busy
and haven't done any but I really want
to get back on it anyway
is anyway we really know how to have fun
on a Friday night Alfie how much you
enjoy in this puzzle time I have
actually enjoyed it you know I just find
it frustrating that half of them upside
down
cuz I feel like I'm probably looking at
the same ones again and again yeah I
tipped them all into the box and I had
to move the puzzle we have joined this
bit we made big moves and this bit we've
had a big news tonight
so that new thing is like three toes
just three silver toe nails are finished
I love them they look so cool let me
show you them properly how cool are they
anyway Papi's gone now the lady the nail
ladies have gone now and I am so cold
I'm wearing my duvet coat again I don't
know I don't think there's gonna be a
day in vlogmas where I'm not wearing
this duvet coat oh my god this song
remember this song yeah
we're in heaven I think what I'm gonna
do is go and have a bath
because I just cannot warm up you know
and you need to defrost like from the
core that's how I feel so I'm gonna go
up
I'm gonna run myself a bar and actually
surprising me oh no I was gonna say
surprisingly I haven't had a bath in
vlogmas yet you all know me I love a
bath like every night oh yes please but
that's a lie because I had a bath in
Scotland you only think oh my god this
room is so cold the only thing I haven't
done is run a bath in this house in
vlogmas aren't you lucky
you can have a bath with me you want to
pick what goes in it
I was bouldering really good did you win
tell you what we could use because it
makes the best bubbles only that is
noella's merry and bright bubble bar is
that high can I pop some of that in
come on muscle I'll tell you when
his human
keep it going
laughter a lot okay he stopped now no no
don't get it on the little flap thank
you did you smell it yeah comparison
talk about between abuse match
I know it's not
have you told in the Box situation where
we have a bar together no I love long
bars chillin
so we liked watching like Netflix or
YouTube in the bar sits out the majority
of our money just in that's what I'm
sharing it and then you do that often
for me it's when I'm sharing it with you
I get I can't lie down so I get bored do
you can I just sleep in the bar I can't
lie down cuz you lie down take up all
the room look at
now we need to set the light yeah we
have lights that look like this which do
confuse a lot of people basically each
button is it does a different thing and
one of them is music so it plays like
specific players at the moment the
playlist is the tech guys playlist but
he did tell me how to change and I
haven't done it yet so sorry root well
it was quite like techno it was it
wasn't like relaxing bath music and what
happened was well my friends came to
stay they were obviously using this
bathroom and I was using it on sweet so
I went to bed and we all say goodnight
and then they obviously came in here and
did 30 even watch their face and one of
them must have pressed the playlist
button and not realised and they didn't
know how to turn it off and they didn't
want to disturb me because they thought
I was asleep so all night in the bedroom
next to the bathroom they just listened
to the sound guys like tech playlist oh
my god you should have just woken me up
and I would have turned it off bless
them and then the same thing happened to
poppy the other day although she did
come and wake me up out the bath and I
actually have Paddington one on in the
background I've just been trying to do
everything trying to answer everything
on my phone I had loads of unread
messages and loads of things that just
hadn't looked at because I was having
one of them so I've had a little look
replied to some and yes I have different
Christmas PJs on this evening I do love
these ones a lot these are monkey
they're so cute but I am so incredibly
tired what's the time half 11 guys this
is way past my bedtime so I'm gonna go
to sleep now but thank you so much for
watching as always so glad you're
enjoying vlogmas I can't believe it's
over a week now day eight
