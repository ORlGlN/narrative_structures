pretty daffodils
in fact so many I have to split it
between two bartha's so here's the other
one with all my birthday cards look
lovely um nullus running around or happy
the sun's just come out which has put me
in a much better mood and I feel really
ill today I don't know what's wrong with
me I just woke up feeling really sick
but the kind of sick where it's kind of
like travel sickness it just kind of
like hovers around you and you're like
oh I just want to lie down and be still
but I'm not going to do that because
it's Dusty's birthday party today here
are all her presents that I've wrapped
up I absolutely love this wrapping paper
it is Oliver bonus wrapping paper it's
what they sent me a little present in
and I was like I love that I own paper
I'm obsessed so I went up to find that
I'm really out of breath as well oh um

Darcy's birthday I don't want to miss it
because you're only for once um and I'm
really excited to give her her presents
and to see her and to see Louise of
course so I'm just going to take a
massive bottle of water with me and just
sip it the entire way even if I'm only
there for half an hour and I managed to
give Darcy her presents and give her a
birthday hug it's worth the five hour
round trip in one day so that is what
I'm doing and you're gonna stay here and
look after Alfie
is that what you're going to do yes why
are you so cute
Oh God well okay um I need to go maybe

had to stop off and grab some like
lucozade sport because I started feeling
sleepy and Alfie was like no don't drive
when you're tired it's very very
dangerous I wasn't tired I just didn't
feel like peppy you know on a long drive
