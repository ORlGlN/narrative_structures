a really really long flight but it was
very smooth there was no turbulence at
all which I was very scared about as the
boys in the back nice and spacious
little this is so cute
balls of water and we're just trying to
sort all our technology out because look
no one can live without their take Mike
I'm going to do it huh no you do it
it's really weird from here like your
leg just does not look like it's
attached to your body we're now in our
hotel I actually feel a little bit not
good I think it was traveling I feel a
whip travel sick it's been a long travel
e day I'm not good with stuff like that
but we're finally in our hotel room and
we have like this sickest view of the
back of Disney I don't like the
Convention Center there there's a
convention center definition that
zooming over there look at that right
that's a roller coaster that one I'm
around now I see you can see it right is
that I will I wonder look at here over
the back of that old up the scenery yeah
um this is the stuff you don't get to
see when you're at Disney maybe that's
how the Tower of Terror or doom or some
of that Joe was saying which one drivin
that big one of it over the thing on top
this one yeah this one I would really
like to go to Disney in um la renta like
joe said this one was really good yeah I
really like I'd like the Sun right
Osiris will yeah it go on the ferris
wheel actually yeah it's not fast is it
alright so fast that one is it it comes
off detachment I'm sure um also we've
got a really nice view out this window
as well I would like the pool so we can
see everyone outside like it's just so
light like our room is so light and
lovely and then we've got a little bit
through here which is the pool as well
so that's really cool and toilet awesome
with a couple mirror
the cupboard but there's no minibar
nor even for the minibar they are going
to be thinking which all that drinks
we're drug them out now I talk about
commonplace that we can put food also we
and we quite want to get like
cheesecakes from the Cheesecake Factory
and store them in a fridge but they're
eager it's okay we can just eat it no we
can feel this revised or cold water and
put it in there yeah okay so I think I'm
going to end today's well here maybe I
think yeah it's been a very long day I'm
very very tired I just need to lie down
so I can stop feeling so sick man first

the morning

of confused a bit hungry a bit travel
sick it's all about it's a very big
mixture of different things so I will
see you tomorrow thing about my night

be happy with that
