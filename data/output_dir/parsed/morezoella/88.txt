ah hello everybody welcome to blogeee
birthday 11
Oh
so annoying this throw is like slightly
too small I really like it though this
is from West Elm this is also from West
down this cushion and then the all is
calm all is bright cushions are from
Bowden and actually they've got them on
both sides yay
nothing like a freshly made bed hair is
washed basic makeup applied I can't be
bothered to do too much it's Sunday it's
like lazy face and hair day I've just
decided I've got my sug life hoodie on I
love this one and it makes me so are
blind it makes me so happy that so many
of you have been loving the March and
it's so cool seeing what you've all been
ordering I like to go through my Twitter
and like look at all my mentions to see
what sort of things everyone's really
loving and this seems like a top
contender but I am currently wearing a
medium but that's because it was the
only sample ones we had I am actually a
small this one is like way too big for
me I would prefer to have a small which
would be a little bit better in size for
me just because I think that confused
quite a lot of people because they were
like what size are you wearing and I
said a medium and they were like wait if
you're a medium then that ain't gonna
fit me but this doesn't fit me either so
I only have a medium because it's the
only one I've got right now I need to
get some smalls sent over to our house
and then I will be wearing the smalls
so this for now is fine although
incomplete depends because some people
might want to wear them slightly buggier
um but I feel like this is just a little
bit too baggy for me personally if
you're a medium this is a medium
absolutely loving all your feedback so
far it makes me so happy that you're all
um you know enjoying it loving it
ordering it and I literally cannot wait
until you start getting these through
the post do I want to wear my little
bubble hat today maybe I do
I haven't worn this yet I believe me and
Alfie are going to go out for some lunch
which would be very nice it's such a
lovely day today ignore the fact that
I've put my hat in my hoodie it's just
easier to carry it when I've got this in
my hand yeah it's such a lovely day
today I think these sorts of days are
definitely my favourite where it's like
wintery and crisp and cold but it's also
really sunny much better than rain it
was so miserable yesterday oh my god
when I was editing my vlog and getting
like fluff in my lip lip oil ah when I
was editing my vlog yesterday um there's
one bit in the time-lapse where I'm on
the motorway and the weather is awful
like honestly that is the worst weather
to drive in on the motorway because you
can only really see like two cars in
front of you and the windscreen wipers
are constantly going and I was like no
this is so depressing I like winter when
the sun's out but yeah um what's going
on in here is it nighttime Alfie seems
to have made himself comfortable under
the first row this was me last night
Nullah have you found the perfect little
spot she always likes to sleep in the
little V of our legs boom yes
where are they going Nala what I don't
understand is how she knows that that's
moving like an animal without it being
an ant like without it being a real
animal do you know what I mean
like that's an animation I am currently
editing a thumbnail on me laptop and
waiting for Elfie before we can go out
we are off to grab a hot chocolate or a
coffee or basically just get out the
house really you ready
thanks I got everything you need
mobile your phone your wallet your keys
your dignity
oh you don't have a dignity not portable
water hold beautiful day
look our little wreath is really cute
actually lights up this is from John
Lewis Lee think
Alfie's mom actually thought this was
real she actually like feeling it like
is this real looks really nice I think
okay la come on my driving or are you
driving I Drive actually I drove all of
yesterday maybe you should drive or do
you want me to why don't I Drive to
Dad's you drive to the closet I don't
know I thought maybe you might struggle
to pull out this road I don't if you're
joking
are you being serious all right you
drive then I literally just drove this
car this morning for like 45 minutes
okay you drive oh my
I'll be the passenger sorry Alfie I
forget that you are a fully fledged
driver now okay wait you bring your key
you are so confusing
yeah actually it'll be nice to be the
passenger that you name what was weird I
Drive my Audi yesterday oh wait can you
hit the fob open the gate I drove my
Audi yesterday for the first time in
like a week
yeah and because it's only a 1.6 liter
engine oh it wasn't as far you put your
foot down it just doesn't go anywhere
like come on that changing gear like to
go 30 miles per hour
it takes so much longer than this car to
go that split that fast
yeah I've just never noticed it because
that's all I was used to having on our
permits we're going to pick up Alfie's
dad who's also coming with us on our
little hot chocolate adventure
it's really weird because like weird in
this you know you can drive by like your
life so like just then you're like
checking that there's not another car
there I can see it in the camera that
there's no guard there you are still
quite a new driver I've driven in next
month there will be a year I know I I'm
just a control freak but also I am quite
experienced when it comes to driving you
just like being in control that's what
it is no I like to draw I actually enjoy
driving I'm blind
I actually enjoy driving so do i I just
don't say at the joint no it's like I
don't let you
you have probably have not done
motorways yeah yes wait I let you join I
want to get run over do you see him no
yeah but we haven't done motorways yet I
don't Alexander house that's not really
a motorway what you're making this
that's a dual carriageway with extra
lane no no Ashley is look Christmas
trees
oh we didn't need to go so far I don't
know why I'm still filming this is just
like a car vlog so tell me where did you
go this Sunday did you go in the car
where did you go to who drove I'm gonna
end this now because I'm literally just
crumbling
also can we leave on a note sure so why
does everyone walk out in the road on
Sundays I feel like it's just Sunday's
you know that bit in the spice world the
movie where she goes Sunday drivers it's
only Saturday do you remember that bit
nope
Oh whenever someone is driving badly
that that quote comes into my head
doesn't matter what day it is
but yesterday when I was driving and
there were some really not good drivers
on the road in my head I went Sunday
drivers it's only Saturday oh boy this
is my lifeline oh really
it's quite an iconic line in the spice
world Spice Girls the movie which is a
great movie just get rid of that right
okay give us up now I just got to a
Mandarin Nicks and I want to show you
all the little bits and pieces that
Amanda's done for Christmas I'm ready
look at the tree all the sun's like
shining in can't really see she's got
some little Christmas decorations me and
Alfie bought them these as a thank-you
they're a bit weird but all in in good
sense of humor
so far that's all that's on there there
is going to be more decorations and then
look at the fireplace it's so pretty
are all these Christmas hats for us on
Christmas Day yeah ah I'm just very good

also need to upload my main channel
video which tonight is one of my
favorite ones I filmed it with Mark when
we were both feeling really hyper it's
one of those ones where I feel like

just mental but if you're watching this

Brussels sprout challenge in the bomb

of naps fix everything cushions this is
my rainbow Christmas tree though oh my
god I don't think I've shown you look at

of sad that it's up here because I don't
really get to like appreciate it as much
as I would if it was downstairs oh maybe
I should put it in our bedroom where
could that go in our bedroom okay I'm
gonna put this Christmas tree in our
bedroom I reckon I can carry it down do
you think that bumbles will smash I
don't know it is a 4-foot tree I just
feel like I want this in our bedroom I'm

you stay there oops
okay now the camera won't focus perfect
I think I just broke my camera no we're
not even halfway through flog with yet
okay oh oh no oh no it won't focus this
is the most it focuses hmm oh no oh I
think it's working in the space of five
minutes I broke my camera and dropped my

my pocket and it went straight in my way
oh my god where if I just put it I just

bedroom window it's not really doing it
justice look that's it that's more like
it
it looks crazy and actually that is the
see there I can see see I've got the
tree in although I'm really aware now
that I didn't decorate the bottom I only
really decorated the doll hmm okay now
let's try and plug it in yeah oh my god
I love it I think how he will love it
what a great spur-of-the-moment idea I
just had I think what I like about this
so much is these colored lights are like
the old style they have quite like a
retro feel to them like it has pink no
new lights have pink in them and I think
that's why I really like it mmm

my vlogs only money lady okay come what
is it
just literally just come and look in the
let's call it some folks recklessly yeah
it's crazy isn't that so Christmassy I

upstairs but I decided to move it down
here because we couldn't appreciate it
it's officially Christmas right I won't
disturb you anymore just missing 12 days

vlogs gonna be late it's gonna be low

when we drape your rod what if you
filmed yourself light some candles yeah
that's what I thought too which is why
I'm doing it now look at that

archery I feel like doesn't look as
impressive now we've just done your
mum's mom amazing yeah and it's huge
has it got one very powerful now there's
some purple ones and some green ones but
quite a lot of like similar like glass
and like whiten or just got shiver down
my spine you know what that means
I mean someone's morphing every grave it
means it's someone at the window look
can you see them yeah hello my battery's
about to run out so I thought I would
say good night you know what really
upsets me about you what something yes
that you're one of the people that do
that Clara photos I will never
understand somebody crunch that whilst
they drink they go like this I can't
read it
fill me like that no it's because I suck
water out I'm like that's what it is you
suck the air out you don't just drink
that's why I get trapped ways that mean
that you put your mouth over the whole
thing no I don't I don't you try there
yeah I just prop a sucker
oh you're weird right do you know what I
was just about to say my battery runs
out can I borrow your battery quickly um
because it's flashing and that's gonna
annoy me I was just looking at like
Aries traits cuz evany just posted I'm
such an Aries and then like a screenshot
of like everything that an Aries is I'm
so not an Aries like everything that an
Aries list like all of Aries traits is
so not me I feel like most people are
like yeah my star sign is so me I'm
lying I'm not I'm Way more of a I think
Pisces I'm Way more of something that's
near Aries that's not Aries gorgeous
you're so sporting so aggressive
courageous determined confident
enthusiastic optimistic honest and
passionate weaknesses impatient moody
short-tempered impulsive and aggressive
I just don't think uh many are feelings
I don't think there's Aries likes taking
on leadership roles literally my least
favorite thing in the world physical
challenges no thanks individual sports
no cycles over Aries dislikes inactivity
I mean look at me do I look like I'm not
enjoying this um delays work that does
not use one's talents like it's just so
not me whereas like Marc is a hundred
percent his star sign you are a hundred
percent your star sign mine just isn't
anyone else out there who reads these
stars own things and thanks
I wish that sounded like me but it just
doesn't anyway enough of that I'm
rambling and I'm about to about to roll
out so I really hope you've enjoyed
today guys give it a thumbs up if you
