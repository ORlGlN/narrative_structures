come on oh she does not like that I'm
just left there we go you go in mother
are you off to
inside she looks so tiny next to Alfie's
shoe every time someone comes to my
house they leave an item of clothing so
I believe this is Marcus's t-shirt with
cream on it for money filmed with Alfie
this is my dad's cardigan slash jacket
and this is my brother's jacket so guys
you FEM got some some of your garments
here for you I'll keep them safe in my
little everyone that leaves something at
my house pile that is actually Alfie
city I just I've been wearing it cuz I'm
not wearing it for any like sentimental
value like oh it smells a bell for you I
really miss him I do miss him but that's
not why I'm wearing a city it doesn't
really smell of him it smells of me
because I wear it more than him it's the
evening now and ho look at all this mess
it's called Nala toys and a clotheshorse
I couldn't be bothered to put away um
I'm just gonna turn some the lights off
don't hit cuz I'm gonna head upstairs
I've got a very bad headache and you
want to know why I've got a bad headache
well I'll tell you why um I don't drink
enough water I'm naughty and I I always
do it I forget to drink
fluid um and then in the evenings I
suffer immensely with really bad
headaches I had a really bad headache
yesterday and I didn't learn medicine
and I didn't drink enough today
I basically stopped writing
Alfie's mum came and visited me for a
while which was lovely we just sat and
chatted and now I'm
I'm in like two minds do I write another
chapter or do I edit a vlog I feel like
firstly I feel like this camera just
won't focus there we go
but I feel like the days go really
quickly and I just run out of time to do
anything like it's already 9 p.m. and I
need to edit vlog which I'll have to
obviously put up tomorrow now because by
the time I've actually edited and
uploaded it will be so late
and then Joe is coming back tomorrow so
we can film again yeah um it's not
really been a very exciting day today
kind of viewing wise I feel like because
I can't film me I can film me writing
but you literally just see my hands
tapping away like I can't I can't
divulge in what I'm what I'm writing
it's the book obviously but I can't like
tell you like oh listen to this chapter
I've just written or oh my god this
scene that I've just put in my
absolutely love so much like I can't
divulge in in the can you tell I have a
headache I feel like I'm very lackluster
right now I'm trying my best to be happy
um I need to just did you know I need to
do I just need to not look at a screen
and down a pint of water is what I need
to do but I'm blogging instead and I'm
going to edit a vlog instead um Nala is
licking my feet what are you doing
I don't need my feet licked my feet
looked my foot clicked I need to do so
much before I go on holiday ah we'll go
back well basically go on holiday in
like two weeks and I need to have the
book finished I don't need to have it
finished before I go away but I want to
have it finished like the first draft
obviously there's still a lot more to do
after the first draft but first draft
wise I want to get that finished before
I go on holiday so that means I need to
do another 20,000 words
it's doable it just means I might be on
social media a lot less and I probably
won't get dressed much back can you hear
a licking my feet stop that little
scoundrel oh my goodness
camera cooperate
why are you finding this so difficult
anyway I gotta stop rambling now and I'm
going to edit a blog and drink lots of
water so that I don't get headaches and
if you're watching this now and you've
not really had a lot to drink today go
and pour yourself a cold glass of water
and down it and then let me know that
you've done it awesome no play with it
over there and she brings it back this
is never ending oh oh Nala get off no
come on
over here look you've got all the space
on the bed yeah you play with it there
good girl no give it a second and she's
back oh don't worry I didn't I didn't
want to use that laptop just there by
you that's fine you carry on oh god
she's tweeting she's tweeting Nala what
do you do oh she's humping no what are
you doing this is all gone so wrong she
does love that toy a lot this is what
came in the woof box she likes these
textures like this texture like that
kind of fluffy Oh what are you doing

that's kind of scary that's kind of my
free Flurry's display picture let's take
that down I don't know why you've done
that Nala was it her display picture I
don't know where that even came from oh
she just posted it on Twitter hmm are
you done go play with it over there

fetch so that's my own fault I would
like you to just just play with it there
