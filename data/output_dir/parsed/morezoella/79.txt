okay I'm blind together I am about to
get ready for the day even though it's
midday I've been running around like
headless chickens morning trying to sort
out some like work bit and tidy up spare
room
we get mark coming to play I'm so
excited I haven't seen him since before
Christmas so I think this have probably
been almost missing lighting I think
this has probably been the longest we
haven't hung out with each other and it
feels like a lifetime so I'm so excited
to see him it's a beautiful day I think
we'll probably go around Brighton and go
for lunch or do something nice like that
but yeah I'm super excited I'm going to
do my makeup now and I need to sort this
lighting out because I can't do my
makeup like this because I can't even
for my
oh yeah I actually feel so much more
human when I do my makeup okay so mark
is still not here yet which is good I
just had a little like work call meeting
so I'm feeling quite productive and it
is the most beautiful day listening to a
little bit of little Mick what to jump
from because it's actually still quite
chilly I feel I would show you my outfit
of the day so we have this jumper which
is a really polite pink and it is the
softest thing in the world is so nice
it's kind of like batwing II and loses
quite 80s and it has a kind of high ish
neck and then I've got my little black
Asus waist belt and then these mum jeans
which have embroidery on them and I am
of Spri I really like this outfit and
then I have my UGG slippers which don't
particularly go but I'm going to put
like either boots or trainers on and but
yes that is my outfit of the day I don't
know whether to leave my hair in like
this like half up half down like
ponytail or to do like the bun that I've
been doing quite a lot recently I don't
know which one I'm feeling more I just
think I look like one of those funny
dogs like this like funny ears I don't
know I might do the bun actually leave
us on Topshop I don't know if I said and
also this jumper is from Topshop - I'll
leave a link in the description box of
anything that I am wearing if it's still
linkable so check down there also I'm
wearing a color pop Bianca lip color and
be more fall into the frost trustful
fall into the
some things morphe palette I tidied all
of the spare room look how unchristian
see it is in here now makes me so sad
but I do have my zoella lifestyle map
sticks everything cushion and some like
fluffy ones and I have kept like a tiny
nod to Christmas because I've got my
gingerbread hungry hands hand cream and
a spiced gingerbread candle although
that is very festive because it has a
gingerbread man on it so maybe we'll
take that away actually what will
replace that candle that's slightly too
festive and then on this side I've got a
little diptych handle my plan and my
bedside table lamps which were from
HomeSense and i really really like them
well maybe it was TK maxx but same thing
i have a little collection of things
that i've been meaning to give mark or I
fought him over like the past month
this is his memory card that he left
behind and then I bought this for him
for Christmas and forgot to give it to
him but it's a gin and tonic Canon door
this is the marshmallow pumpkin latte
which is our favorite scent from Bath &
Body Works and we ordered loads of these
scrubs and I should ask the music I
couldn't find them and then I found them
over Christmas this is something he also
ordered I think it's a vanilla bean room
spraying I think I definitely didn't
order it so I'm assuming it's something
Mike ordered and then this company sent
me two of these and in the little note
that they wrote in my PA box they said
here's twos you can give one to somebody
and I knew their mark would really like
this always tried to be a little kinder
than necessary because that is so like a
mark motto I went with the bun I just
it's just left in my face and floppy and
I really like it so it's been way over
mom I know I said this is as long as
it's ever been with this knowledge about
majorly marks for himself and lunch yet
