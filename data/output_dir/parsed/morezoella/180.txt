just stop on too much oxygen too many
trees too much of the castle we've just
come into a little tea rooms it is
called the Tudor Rose Tea Room and we
have decided to have a little cream tea
pit stop because there's a lot of places
for cream tea around here and look at my
hot chocolate that's just arrived oMG

I also got an elderflower because I can
never finish a hot chocolate
hmm I like warm swans so yummy
we've just finished at the frugal
waffles like Fischer of that restaurant
huh just finished up our scones I am
full and now we're just wandering down
through the town
it's pretty cute in erendor look at
those little houses it looks like a lot
of low ceiling buildings you know I mean
I feel like I'm finna get run over oh I
am I am I am just got back from errand
oh I've dropped poppy home I'm just
wearing my little hat it's a pumpkin I
kind of wanted to do this whole thing
and just not mention it and just be
wearing my little pumpkin hat but I
can't just not mention this I had such a
lovely day out in arendelle with poppy
and Carrie and yeah it's just a really
lovely cute little town lovely canal
amazing castle and as a cathedral - I
think I might have taken some pictures
of that I can't remember um and now I'm
so tired I really really want a bath but
yeah loving my freaking hat I feel very
on-trend right now
hat goals I've decided that I'm gonna
have a bath so my laptop is charging
downstairs because I really love to have
a bath in the evenings and catch up on
Anna and Jonathan's videos because I
love them and I will set up their videos
so that is what I like to do when I'm in
the bath it's time to pick a bath bomb I
know that you guys like to be included
in the process and elimination process
of elimination so what have we got here
these are massage bars Alfie actually
told Mohini through one of these in the
bath the other day very glad he didn't
is this some fun um we've got a few
dashing centres down there this one is
screaming out to me though not going to
lie this one is I forgot what it's
called but it's you can get it you can
get it online you can get it in the
Oxford Street store it's pretty damn
cool I almost I think I filmed it in a
video before actually but I do almost
want to film it for you just so you can
see it we've got a king of skin here I'm
going to use that in the bath Tanya
loves these
she's always raving about how king of
skin but please do start this one this
one smells like
Nili which was like a limited-edition
one Valentine's once I it was like in
the shape of she don't remember it's a
suit of a heart you think it's not so
good I'm going to rub this on my body
after I get out bath Robert on my
brother so that is my bath reading gonna
go for one of these it's a very lush
filled bath
this time a key of skin although I have
forgotten how I use that I think would
just rub it on my skin in the bars could
be wrong I'm gonna double-check I'll
probably end up texting time and time
I've forgotten how to use king of skin
then she'll ring me give me a tutorial
um so yeah that's all I'm gonna do the
time has come to pop in the bath bomb
let's do this whoa
magical although I do have to say all
the colors mixed together and it goes a
kind of gray color in the end but it
looks cool it looks cool I want to get
in it while it does that okay I'm going
to get in there although I bet you it
actually looks cool in about two minutes
instead of now but yeah cool bars have
my bar as you can see I haven't yet
taking my makeup off just chilling in
bed we've just had dinner
and it's got to that point of the
evening Alfie deyes where we want just
where we play sound probably never
taken me not my level yet just by lil
bit of XP I was in the lead last time
and now you've overtaken me I'm helping
yeah I'm baking some cookies right now
our night if any of you have a venue if
I've managed to friend any of you on
there you can only friend 50 people
check my thing every now and then
