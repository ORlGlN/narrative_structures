haven't you got a really festive tacky
Christmas jumper on so more at your day

clothes
have you ever heard of a laundry even
have to do it don't trust my London are
you doing that with five no you know

my balls
you don't realize this step to me
falling on the balls in the car step in
complete standstill traffic on the
motorway just hooked on my phone and
they'd been a really bad accident so I'm
really hoping everyone's okay I hate
when there's like big scary accidents
like this especially when it's so close
to Christmas but yeah just I would
update you I had a really really nice
time with my friends it was so nice to
see them and just to hang out at my at
my friend Alex's house and we all did
Secret Santa and it was just really
really lovely so now I kind of need to
get back soon because I'm gonna go and
see my nan and give her her presents
which I'm excited to do as well but
hopefully this traffic kind of clears up
the accident happened a while ago so
this is kind of the
backlash and I just checked online it
did say traffic was had returned to
normal but this doesn't look like
traffic's return to normal
oh dear okay so I've swung by my dad's
house picked up Alfie who is now putting
petrol in the car loving is life because
he loves the smell of it and then we are
heading over to my Nan's house where my
dad my brother already are to give her
her Christmas presents and to say Merry
Christmas and just to chill have a load
drinky-poos that's what Christmas is all
about isn't it like running around to
different family members and saying
Merry Christmas which I really like to
do guys it comes and look at some
Christmassy houses it is not Christmas
unless you go to Christmas houses
feminine oh it's making Christmassy
noise that's so cool
let's put some money in let's put some
money in imagine the electricity bill on
this guy it's so cool
which one singing that Center is quite
creepy they're not going to lie right
next one that one's pretty good isn't it
it's so good
how much you think that costs for them
to do that - it's not true
think it costs a lot holy crap did you
see that what sonic lost Explorer huh
I like these see guys this house here on
this corner is normally the house that
goes to absolute town on its lights it
doesn't have as many this year but they
still have a couple in there so that
one's fairly Christmassy the house that
goes that morning oh hello mate I've
been down there more than anyone else

taking a break for our fall Christmas
display this year long story takes on
five solid weeks Wow look that's what it
normally looks like guys how much you
feel like a massive kid right now okay
I'm excited going around like it's
Christmas this year what do you mean you
feel the most Christmas you've ever felt
this year Yeah right now do you know I
think that's because I've made you more
festive because you're literally dressed
in snowballs that's why I think it might
be because I started selling know is it
not as in the most Christmas in my life
as in this year right now is the most
amazing moment this year do you not
think I feel like they probably compete

look at that oh my goodness oh they're
in the car they're pulling up outside

spare hands I love it you can come and

lights

best day what reindeer oh it's a

blow-up one is not the father Christmas

everyone where did you go on your walk
we went along canal like Rosie and Jim

tomorrow did you enjoy your walk oh did
you yeah that's right we can drive that
what are you making here right dad's got
some camembert going in so you've got
some cloves of garlic from anarse gonna
be garlicky dad that's probably enough
net what we say to get a bear at a tree
come on bear done and then I've put some
honey on this one because like we had
when we had Tanya and Jim around and we
had honey in it it was so good dad's not
as convinced he's more up for the garlic
but I'm very excited for some camembert
because it's been stinking out the
fridge for so long we can actually
finally just eat it
I also have to edit a video for Monday
which I'm going to try and do I might
have to get Alfie to help me got my
boyfriend got Michael Buble ha ha oh no
got Michael Buble on the TV singing all
Christmas songs got out B days got
camembert and bread thing oh my god
never scary huh good yeah Samia no he
fell asleep on the sofa and it's now 20
past 12:00 I really think I needed that
map I feel so much better I still feel
like I could fall asleep like I don't
feel like oh no I've got a whole night
to try and sleep and I feel wide awake
now
I still feel sleepy but it was really
nice we have Michael Buble on in the
background under the blankets a little
snowboarder we just had a little nap and
it was just really really good I've just
done my face before bed I am wearing
Luna tonight which I really like the
smell of Alfie hates it where is that
the really stinky one it doesn't smell
bad like it just smells quite um huh no
I don't hate that one
oh really mmm when you kiss me last
night I had it on my lips and you would
I earn nice all sticky like I hate lip
gloss it's not lip gloss
it's just oil obviously just goes on my
Oh got something a bit okay how did I
stay mm-hmm how do I do there's like I
guess both n cuz you're too tall your
end
it's my forehead hello um I don't I
don't know if this vlog is long actually
I feel like this is probably gonna be
one of the shortest logs I've done just
because I haven't really filmed much
because when you're going around
visiting people you actually just want
to spend time with them instead of like
filming and then you kind of forget that
you are filming if that makes sense and
obviously not everyone spilled camera
etc etc so I feel like maybe this might
be the shortest log I've done I could be
wrong could be very wrong but I really
hope you've enjoyed today I can't
believe it's the 20th tomorrow that's
insane
so insane and as you're watching this my
video is Mark have gone up actually
which I hope you've all enjoyed if you
haven't seen it yet I'll be a link in
the description box of this video so go
on over and watch that have a little
lull I really love that video it's one
of my favorites I think my other one I
was by the camera yeah you read the
questions out I think that's one of my
things so much answers were a dig it's
funny now he's just like in bed eating a
sandwich mm-hmm oh yeah you've got that
end bit of bread no not the end there oh
my god I hate the end of it I always
leave it in the back I'm like I'm gonna
take somebody loved and burped why we're
a great team
that n-bit is like the most copy bit I
think apparently it's like the worst bit
for you everyone that's why you like it
well that has a lot of crust on it and
they do say you should always eat crusts
well the whole bloomin thing is crossed
isn't it uh yeah I love it I feel like
that would make a great toasty look at
that is so good for that no I'm a
feeling our body really happens anyway
gotta go to bed now love you all lots
because video a thumbs up if you enjoyed
it say goodnight I'll see you on the
phone yes see you on the 20th
