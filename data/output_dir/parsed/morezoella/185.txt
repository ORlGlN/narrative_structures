concoction ever I've also just faced
time for my grand my Nana and granddad
and had a little chinwag with them it's
really nice to catch up with them I'm
going back home kind of closer to
Christmas I'm really excited about that

start wrapping presents because my name
was like I've already wrapped quite a
few of my presents now it's like I mean
I fought quite a few I still have some
to buy but I haven't wrapped any yet but
I really enjoy the process of wrapping
like having a Christmas film or having
the Christmas music on and just like
sitting and wrapping up presents so I'm
sure me and Alfie can do that one day at
some point
oh not when I've got tea please but I
just wanted to tell you that that tea
was like the best thing I've ever tasted
it's so good if you guys can you need to
get hold of it I feel like it's my
favourite why have I not tried it before
Nala she's so needy she literally won't
get off me when I'm trying to edit

long when you have a dog well when you
have a needy dog by the way guys if you
want to get hold of one of these
Christmas jumpers that Alfie's released
