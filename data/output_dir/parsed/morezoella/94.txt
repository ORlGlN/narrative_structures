good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 353 they fall oh my god
I've developed mistake
you know when like your eyes are really
stuck together I woke up with them like
that today it's so Oh a pin cold out
today holy crap holy I need to get my
advent calendars out I have so many
advent calendars I even wrote up an
advent calendar post and I just
completely forgot to post it and I feel
like it's too late I don't know do I
just show you all in a blog the advent
calendars I've got I might just do that
actually instead of putting my blog post
up I might just show you all the advent
calendars I have because there's a lot
of really amazing Beauty ones this year
we'll open some today because I know how
much you guys love watching us open our
advent calendars and I haven't done that
yet why I'm doing these doing Wow
great breakfast are you going by let's
get breakfast on the go
am i sleeping I was zoomed in basically
spent all morning editing yesterday's
vlog I need to stop filming so much this
is like part of my main problem is that
I filmed so many clips and then I'm so
indecisive when it comes to what to
leave in and what to get rid of and then
my vlogs end up being like 30-minute
long flippin episodes so I'm sorry about
that if you don't like long vlogs my
vlogmas is probably not for you and I am
gonna try and make them shorter I'm not
gonna film as much but if I happen to
have a really jam-packed day just
prepare yourselves that they might be a
bit longer I don't know some of you love
them some of you don't it's hard to
please everybody so there are definitely
going to be days this month where I
don't have as much to film but I just I
don't know I just filmed so many Clips I
am now going to go to Waitrose because
we need to do some shopping because we
just basically don't really have any
food in the house and I'm meeting poppy
and Sean there which I'm excited about
oh no my battery's running out got one
battery sorted ok I've got my keys got
my phone got my card
got bags I am ready to go we've made it
to wait rose now you're gonna get basket
or are you gonna get a little a little a
little trolley right gosh it's so cold
it's the Christmas radio time only I
have to get it did you ever use the
highlight what you wanted to watch Mean
Joe did it all the time
yay all just nearly run over some
flowers
Sean's getting some free sushi here's
what one is it ah not that we need any
more but me and papi have found some
really nice what's this called
Slate's and serving where how nice are
they I'm going to get some of them now
really nice creat Christmassy bowls oh
look at the little cake dome skew okay
getting grabbed some already put some
little ones in
but look it's for like a camembert to
camembert and then like a cheese plate
that's nice
Papi's stocking up on lunchboxes get
myself a mini calculator for my calendar
oh yeah Sean Sean and off you've got
little calendars every day I get a
different question how good is that so
good I all remind me I need to get a
chocolate advent calendar because I
don't have one yet and I just think
that's a crime because it's the fourth
already so I'm out for chocolate you do
not have that's more exciting yeah I
know you're planning on doing some
baking soda well today we're going to
turn out custom it like me yeah I much
prefer to bake we have a problem
there's no advent calendars left in
Waitrose what do we do there must be
like a reduce section where they're in
no I don't think there was any yet run
yeah surely not everyone bought and I'd
make calendar so where would they go do
they all just go like to get melted I
know all done in Waitrose I cannot push
that trolley to save my life let's go
it's so weird being in my mini now
compared to the new car
Killa Hansen
queen of New York City when the band
finished playing
you scumbag you me Christmas you're ours
our drink on its own
I might try
I've just started unpacking the shopping
Nullah is running around with this in
her mouth cuz Alfie's not here so I
assume he's gone into town to pick up
his car and he left her with this which
is a dental chew and she's been running
around with it and then she'll drop it
and chew it for like three seconds then
she'll run off with it again like she's
taking her sweet-ass time with this and
she never eats too slowly so either
she's bored of the dental sticks because
she knows they're not really treats or
she's playing with it or she's trying to
get my attention because she keeps
running off with it and then bringing it
back and dropping it right by my feet
and because it's a wooden floor it makes
a really loud bang so I'm not too sure
what she's doing now it just looks like
she's eating it but she'll stop doing my
in a minute and run off with it anyway I
thought I would give you a little
rundown of what I bought from the shops
because if you're anything like me and
you're a little bit nosy it's nice to
see what people buy from the supermarket
I feel like it's food inspiring like
sometimes I'll see things in people's
like food shops now go oh my god yeah
like that why don't I ever remember to
pick it up when I go shopping so it
didn't do a very big shop there's only a
few little essentials because we're away
for a tiny section of next week so I
didn't want to like overload the fridge
I did pick up some Walker's pure butter
shortbread festive shapes because I just
love shortbread and what better time to
eat it than at Christmas because the
packets of biscuits are everywhere like
no wonder they say people put on weight
at Christmas like there's just too many
amazing things to eat I also got me an
Alfie two giant panda shuffle art for
the morning some sesame seed bagels
these which I love we got these on your
in Edinburgh just to like snack on with
her muss
oh my god they've dipped it in camembert
hmm oh my god that's exciting I could do
that
these are caramelized onion flavor
really great I've got a massive jar of
mincemeat in case I want to make some
mince pies some butter some jam which is
over here because I just had a piece of
toast and I've got these for me and
Alfie for dinner roast
can pies and then some veg and some mash
very lazy dinner but it's better than
ordering a takeaway then we move over to
this section which is mostly fridge
apart from bread which is there because
I'm a toast let's move that back over
here Hovis seed sensations okay we've
got celery bacon tortellini baking
potatoes some spinach I got our piece of
sushi I think these ones are just like
salmon and then these are the ones he's
obsessed with and I wish I liked them
but I just don't
it's the crunch salmon roll I've got my
favorite Greek natural strained yogurt
in a big pot and then in case I'm like
running late because more often than not
I'm really naughty and if I've got a lot
to do this lighting is terrible it makes
me look like really accentuates my
forehead know where I can go well the
lighting looks good down lighting is
awful I'm quite bad normally if I'm
having a really busy morning I skip
breakfast and that's not good for you so
I got these which I like quick and easy
yogurt and honey for if we're running
out the door or I've got five minutes
like that's so easy so I've no excuse
I then bought some hummus some
raspberries some strawberries some
pomegranate seeds and some baby corn
which is the guinea pigs favorite
another pie in Aberdeen Angus steak and
ale top crust pie obviously was in quite
a pie mood because I seem to have come
out with quite a few pies maybe it's cuz
it's so cold out it's like you want
something really warming and comforting
to eat and then I also have some of this
which looked too good not to get salted
caramel and ginger granola imagine that
with some yogurt and honey mmm oh and
then I've got this which is some red
pepper and tomato soup and some pasta
sauces to go with the pasta tomato and
basil and then Mario mascarpone
and then of course the Radio Times which
I'm going to have to have a little flick
through and see what's on at Christmas
and New Year there we go now I need to
put it all away
okay it's finally time to decorate this
beautiful tree so here is the box of
decorations we've got lights and decks I
just need to put it on there now I wish
this was as simple as my vlogmas intro
and I just had a little wand and I could
just wave it and it all just went on but
no I just need Alfie's help no one might
genuinely need a ladder I forgot a
little stepladder so yeah does it not be
any good look at Nala Nala we're
matching look you've got your matching
ones too
I've got them on now they're there
they're in the pile
we pulled it off hmm if you care to join
us
oh I've still got my sticker on the
ladies oh it's because she saw a dog or
something trolls it's a troll Nala
let's do their Welsh like Peggy
we've always got that one little bit
that's left over which we're now just
gonna wrap around stalk oh god we might
even have too much for the stalk I don't
have to get that down okay there's me
thinking these lights might not be
enough although I feel like there's a
lot on the whole tree we're watching The
Grinch where are you Christmas why can't
I find you what you're barking at
there's a lot up there do you think Alex
rubbish like it looks like there's too
many like a Yeti down here is there
maybe we should just pull these down
into so long to better undo that bit
back at the top I know I think once we
got Bob always I'll be fine
yeah do you think yeah the top will just
we just need some it's sick on the top
in fact we can all we can put some needs
some room there no but I say we leave it
but what we need is just a little bit
funny
maybe if we step back it does look like
a lot on top
like we could put way more this bit is
more here yeah oh man the likes is
always the worst bit right I'll do it
yeah let's undo the top let's undo the
top I'm from like there we'll just Pat
it out more then what if you don't reach
the top we will we will we know we've
got a lot of excess it looks good there
is just that one bit though look in my
camera yeah up up it's that bit it needs
something on that yeah yeah perfect and
then maybe a teeny bit underneath that
yeah

all the decorations out which one's your
fav I've seen them all yeah i like the
