hello good morning guys it's actually
the day up
Nullah that's rude get down it's
actually the day after my book launch
yesterday was so busy and but also just
very exciting and I didn't really feel
much at my book launch which I know I'm
gonna regret and you guys gonna be like
no I think some other people was logging
though but it was just really hard for
me to vlog and like get my camera out
when I so desperately wanted to actually
have conversations with everybody and
kind of talk to everybody and when I got
back I was like I completely forgot
refilm so I'm really sorry about that
I'm going to insert a couple of the
clips that I do have now
very nice very nice
blossom tree a hopping Oh
swish
Oh No I've dropped it all right here is
just saying that okay I'm going in I'm
going in I come around outside online
beep so this is nothing here
okay I'm going in
no I just want to personally
congratulate Zoey for amazing
achievement yeah I'm just going to play
you a few choose you're gonna have to
talk to me for approximately 27 minutes
so I am now chilling with Martha and
Nala who met the first time yesterday
didn't you yes and you both love each
other oh well I think they do Martha but
why are we doing this on the sofa let's
get down I think they love each other
it's quite funny because now I was just
so much bigger than her in all aspects
look at yuria looking rewritten flopped
over she's really cute though I woke up
this morning and I've taken them both
outside for toilet and yep and we fed
them we've both had their dinner it was
very hard to kind of tell okay I thought
you were waiting then Martha she's just
sat down this is so cute it's so funny
because Nala doesn't have a snout not
snap but I can like a proper dog nose
Martha can do things that Nala doesn't
do like Martha can like root through my
makeup bag and like pull the brushes out
and like run around with them which is
really cute
but obviously not I can't do that she's
got squished face but it's quite nice
like look at you both chilled now
actually I quite like it yesterday was a
little bit intense I think they kind of
were doing that playful thing where they
kind of see the boundaries of each other
I'm not really sure how the dogs work
but now they're pretty chilled except I
think Martha wants that you I'm at time
you're in gyms if you didn't notice we
stayed here last night because we can
leave Nala for four hours it seemed like
a good idea to bring Nala here before
the launch head to the launch because
Tania a new moon in London and we had
like a cozy night in last night which
was so lovely um and now we are here but
we're heading back around midday
um yeah I've been going on Twitter this

little bit later on now um had a really
lovely morning with Tanya Alfie and

sadly because he was filming for his
documentary which is all very exciting
um there's some reason I am just so
tired today I didn't sleep very well
last night because not always barking
and crying and then I've got this thing
at the moment where once I'm woken up I
really struggled to get back to sleep
um and if it's past 5 a.m. I won't get
back to sleep it's just kind of like I
feel like it's like may as well just
stay awake now um so I did that this
morning I woke up really early and went
down like did the dogs and fed them and
stuff and but now I just feel so tired I
feel like it's because of the weather
today it's really gray and dreary and
cold and rainy and the sort of weather
way you just kind of want to have a bath
get into your comfy clothes and snuggle
under a blanket and just get really cozy
and which is half what we're gonna do
basically if you remember last year and
myself Naomi Marcus and Tanya had a bit
of a kind of Halloween shindig and we
just kind of watched Halloween type film
