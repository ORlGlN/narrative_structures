good morning Oh is anything watched my
Primark haul um I have this waistcoat on
and I said this is gonna be a nightmare
for Nala well turns out no turns out I
was right
oh geez no Nala come on needs a tassels
alone no no anyway I'm about to film my
video for today Nala No
huh and I think I want to do a what's in
my bag actually I wasn't planning on
doing that but I've just watched a
couple on YouTube and I forgot how much
you loved them and I haven't done one
since 2013 I would say yeah so I feel
like that's a video can be done an
updated version and right now I'm
absolutely loving my handbag so just
figure that what makes it stop that
Missy you've got so many toys we've so
many toys and you want to play with my
tassels which I knew would happen okay
no no so I'm just setting up to film I
don't know whether I should like to
share my setup because I don't love
people that want to start YouTube are
always really interested or even people
that do do YouTube I know I'm a bit like
that although to be honest with you I'm
not really um as knowledgeable it's like
Alfie Alfie is like super knowledgeable
about like how cameras work and how
lights work and the best lights and
things um but I just kind of ask people
what I use and then if it looks good I'm
like cool that might work
so for anything like me and you want to
see how I do this I say do this I mean
it's not really that difficult
although carrying a tripod up and stair
this because I haven't compacted it
compacted it what's the word retracted I
don't know I do though so this is my
light it is a Manfrotto spectra one by
one I like this because you can change
the brightness so oh wait that's not the
bright
brightness is there so you can dim it
make it really bright you can also
change the color so you can make it
warmer or brighter by the way this is
the back of the light that's the front
but I don't want to blind you and I
really like these I used to have soft
boxes but I moved on to these because
with the softbox you're changing the is
it the aperture or the shutter speed I'm
not sure which one on the camera to kind
of suit softbox whereas this way you can
kind of change the light without having
to change too many settings on the
camera so um apparently that's good I
don't know why I'm pretending like I
know what I'm talking about because I
really don't this is my tripod it is the
velbon I bought this in like 2013
because Alfie had it and he knew what he
was doing with it so I'm filming in here
which is the spare room I really like
this room I think it's really like
bright and airy and I like my little
Ruby Ruth dolls that ones Malcolm that's
Malcolm that's Rita and this is actually
a pillow case that I bought alfie awhile
ago
it says salt and pepper rock and roll
bread and butter fish and chips
sweet and sour bed and breakfast gin and
tonic me and to you I just thought
that's recued and I've got my little
fairy lights I kind of giving a room
tour as well
what's this turned into anyway yeah no
I've just finished filming my what's in
my bag this is my bag so if you guys
want to go see what's in it I will leave
a link in the description box to that
video and you can go and find out what
junk I carry around with me on a daily
basis also just quickly just to show you
the rest of the setup the camera that
I'm using is the 70d so you can see in
the screen wait let me zoom I just find
if I'm on my own it's a lot easier to
use a camera with a flip-out screen so
you can check that you're still in focus
or you're still actually you know
recording because a lot of the time
we'll cut off at a certain point which
is so annoying and the amount of times
I've done that is so frustrating I'm
using the Sigma which ones is 18 to 35
mil I really like this lens it's really
really nice and the rode mic this is
actually Alfie's because mine is out of
factory so it's just a little shotgun
road mic and that's pretty much
everything that I use today sometimes
it's a bit more complex sometimes it's
actually easier but it depends on the
kind of video you're making I guess and
how much help you have so if Alfie was
here I could have used maybe a different
lens if I do a makeup look I would tend
to use I would tend to use a lens that
is like 30 to 50 ml because it's like a
lot more crisp the focus and it also
lose the background a bit more blurry
that probably has a proper scientific
like photographic explanation but I
don't know it so that's my explanation
for it
I was just editing my main channel video
and then Alfie came back from town and
we are about to go off and see his mum
because today it's Mother's Day in the
UK um
we're writing in a card ah ewriting how
much you love her
Alfie's like the least soppy person
aren't you yeah um legit nearly decide
that pointlessblog
no you didn't wait let's blog um I'll
resume my editing when I get back we
should take over the rest of the the
rest of the cookies but I made yesterday
should we do that
there we go
cookies all bags these bags are so cute
they're from week Tros so we can give
those and also this is really funny look
what I found in my guinea pig cage this
morning it used to be a coaster
I think either Amelia or Eduardo found
it and put it in the keep it caged and
they've had a little more on it so funny
I was like what is that and I was like
looking at it I was like I'm pretty sure
that's not something I've given the
guinea pigs do on but I think it was
probably something that Amelia roid
Mladic if it keeps you on and so that
was quite funny hello but no I want you
