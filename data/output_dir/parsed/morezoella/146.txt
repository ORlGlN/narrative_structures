good morning everybody I thought I would
vlog today because there's quite a few
exciting things going on but I have a
meeting now I'm going with Carrie and
Maddy
Carrie got some secret things in the bag
we don't know what they are and we are
also after the meeting because it is a
SOG product meeting after the meeting we
are going to go down to super drug and
actually see the Sweet Inspirations
range on the shelf which I haven't
actually been able to do yet and they've
been in stores since Monday so we're
going to go and do that just for I'd
bring you along with me today cuz why
not why I love your jacket where's it
from
Oh No Laura okay let me grab my bag and
probably keys let's go after being stuck
in what felt like the world's worst
traffic for about 20 to 25 minutes we
are finally at the meeting there are so
many exciting things on the day we run a
bit what we're going to do the fragrance
is in so you're going to love meeting it
all finished so we have come into the
crackery which I have been in before all
four times and we have gone foursome
what I called when I not speak very
favori threats I've gone for the Italian
got this so they're cream v pods buff
latte and the little R cubed and look
guys the body fondant and actually it
looks like that is quite popular and
then the bag
looking's right by the door look what
else they've got look some last bits of
tutti frutti have to say this is still
one of my favourite herb bags
oh I love this it's like a proper little
Zionists and the SLG girls are like
tidying up all the shelves it's so funny
where are they rearranging the shell-bed
Allah consistent bloggers it's the next
day now but straight hair I don't really
ever straighten my hair anymore
it feels quite weird but I kind of like
it just it's a lot quicker than curling
basically me and Carrie are working in
the office today on various things I'm
kind of too scared to turn my camera
because there's a lot of stuff going on
in here that is confidential for at
least another like six months where can
I put the camera early signing lots of
zoella beauty products Nala do you mind
so we're just doing some bits and pieces
in the office ain't that right
what's that
oh I haven't ordered anything else oh
here is curiouser a special delivery has
arrived which I did not order okay
well I'm gonna
sometimes you write this long
unrealistic to-do list and I think it's
good to sometimes tell yourself that
it's okay to only take off one or two
things on your never-ending to-do list
because today so far all I've done is
take off like one know two things I'm
feeling really bad about it but possibly
my to do this with a little adventurous
that's why I'm going to tap myself
anyway look at this little Poochie who
sleeps on this all day in the Sun you
love it don't you
I quit knowing her oh oh okay so another
week now what are you doing there Curie
picking my favorite app to find my
favorite sweets British products I'm
gonna go with Instagram what you think
it's gonna be fragrance oh oh the
difficulty I just like to carry how is
that a quiz like what you pick a social
media and that's what your sweet
inspiration is based on Wow like is
Instagram really creamy maybe maybe it's
full of cream either way
you carry on playing my game Karen but
now I keep saying I'm going to do a
proper office tour when it's all kind of
finished and put together but I'm just
rearranged why is there one a beauty
shelf I think it would probably be
better if it had an actual like middle
shelf in it so I could put things in but
look how cute
we've got all the different collections
in there now yay
I know no guess what go carry for
Internet back yeah
um I was just gonna say that the book
club went live yesterday and it has had
the most amazing response ever which
makes me so happy there's so many of you
that are saying I bought the eighth book
bundle and I can't wait to read them
over summer and yeah so exciting and so
many of you that have already read quite
a lot of the books I recommended and you
also love them too and all the authors
that I obviously put their books in the
book club they're already really pleased
and yeah great response
everyone loves reading which is great
and now there's lots more books for you
to read so if you don't actually know
what video I'm talking about I'll leave
it in the description box but um yeah
I'm really happy with the response
you're all loving it so far okay so I
sided oh I'm watching a life simmer
maratti love life simmer Cristina so I
decided not today I mean it's something
I've definitely put off for months and
months
a month too long definitely too long to
sort out my clothes and my wardrobe
so yesterday myself and papi went to
Amanda's and we helped her sort hers out
we're just trying to have a massive pair
up before we go on holiday and I think
it's really good to do this at least
like four times a year because obviously
as the seasons change you know you wear
things and then actually if that season
came back round again twelve months
later would you then wear that again
that is the question I am gonna be
asking myself trying to sort out my
wardrobe I don't know if I've ever
really shown you my wardrobe in here but
I'm currently emptying everything so all
of this is gone all of these are empty
it's just a full open math like look at
this it have no rhyme or reason as coats
with skirts and dresses and it's all too
compact and there's too much I have too
many clothes buying clothes is like it's
fun I like to do it
I'm not going to excuse it
as I enjoy buying clothes and people buy
clothes I definitely buy more than the
average and more than I need and so it
accumulates quite rapidly and it's
important that I do this and sort
through it all and get rid of things
that I don't think I will wear anymore
or that maybe you don't even suit me
which is why it's useful to have someone
round so if you're planning on doing
this I hope this video maybe inspires
you to sort out your wardrobe if you
haven't read what's it called then
life-changing magic of tidying I would
strongly suggest you read that or I
think she's just brought out a new one
which is kind of more visual and that's
something about sparking joy I've got it
downstairs but because I read the
original I haven't read the spark joy
one but I would really recommend you
read that it definitely gave me the
boost I needed last time I did this and
now I basically just left it too long so
I need to do it again I just said to
Carrie I think I would really like to
watch someone like clearing out their
wardrobe because I find stuff like that
really interesting but also I'm going to
be really ruthless and - any of you
wondering I am going to donate clothes
to charities and I'm actually
contemplating keeping a few of the like
key items so maybe like the dress I wore
for my product launch and obeying them
for auction I don't know if any of you
would even buy them but because they are
a little bit more special I feel like we
could raise money together for a charity
so I'm kind of I'm wondering if I can do
that and how that's going to work so I'm
going to keep the special things that I
don't want anymore or just things I'm
never going to wear again like I'm
probably not going to wear that dress
again but I would love for somebody else
to feel special in it I also donate to
women's shelters homeless shelters etc
etc because obviously that's really
really important why don't you do this
with me go and grow a black bag empty
out your cupboards empty out your
wardrobe and keep the things you love
try not to be too sentimental that's one
thing that's my one piece of advice I
would give you is try not to be too
sentimental about things if you're not
going to wear it
and it's literally taking the place of
something you're going to wear and love
and you don't need to keep it
having said that really sentimental
things obviously keep but maybe just
keep somewhere else
I don't know I'm just making up rules as
I go now Oh wardrobe can I quite like
this I should have just put it down my
arm just aches so much doing that the
only problem I have is like I wore my
briefs coming up do excuse me uniform I
have is I can't reach things because the
pole is too high
how cool is this jacket I got this for
being in the YouTube rewind video like
that is something I don't know when I'm
gonna wear but there is no way I'm
getting rid of this because I just love
it so much this is kind of like a what's
in my wardrobe video there I should do
one of those hats no woman needs this
many hats unless they like hats hats ha
okay this is the good thing about
carrying out your wardrobe is you find
things you're like oh my god I do not
know where that was great advice I have
so many pairs of jeans one black pair of
jeans is probably fine Zoe maybe to out
push if the other ones are in the wash
but you certainly don't need this minute
Christmas pajama bottoms yeah Chris oh
he remembers this I freaking love this
dress
oh that's pretty you know these people
that have a capsule wardrobe how how how
is that a thing like I do not have the
skills or ability to have a capsule
wardrobe many of you don't know what
capsule wardrobe is google it I think
it's when someone literally has like is
it 30 something items in their wardrobe
and that's it and like everything kind
of goes with everything I definitely see
the plus side of having a capsule
wardrobe
but I just don't know how I could ever
do that
also I feel like the problem with having
a bigger wardrobe it is that you feel
like you can fill it like you're like oh
I've got space for that oh here that
will fit there is before I moved even
before I moved into this house my house
before had like one wardrobe you might
have seen it until my old loads I'm
gonna insert a little clip now the
Wardrobe is almost actually sorted and
that was pretty spacious then coming
into this house this like room is
actually a lot bigger so I collected
more items when I lived at my dad's
house I had like one skinny wardrobe and
a chest of drawers and I was really good
at clearing out my clothes
who remembers this jacket I pretty much
wore it like the entirety of 2013
Maddie's just got back and she said the
alphabat we 12 flavors of ice cream for
my favorite ice cream please
that is exciting oh my god which one's
did he pick which one did you have I
have the chocolate and raspberry with
again yeah that's right where oh my god
what
look how they filled it
oh my god oh no Peter no work so that's
a Nutella carrot cake okay well fine

Alcoholism it you can take it away like
that
