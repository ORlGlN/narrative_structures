you
basically on the Sunday I was getting
ready and then I really didn't feel well
and I was really ill and I couldn't make
it on the Sunday so I literally spent
the whole of Sunday in bed and the hotel
didn't have room service although I
wasn't really that hungry because I
didn't feel well the hotel didn't have
room service
so by the time it got to like 8:00 p.m.
I was like I'm gonna have to have some
food or I'll probably feel worse so I
managed to sort of like scramble myself
together for Louise's last birthday
night we went and had pizza and that was
really lovely but I just feel so gutted
that I missed out on meeting those of
you that were there on the Sunday so I
am really sorry about that
I wish that I wasn't ill like he wants
to be ill and it just sucked because I'd
gone all that way to see you and a hole
at half of the time I was on my own in
bed watching MTV with Italian voiceover
so I didn't understand any of it anyway
um but I would have much rather being
meeting you guys but unfortunately that
was not an option because there was not
well this is how I have to dry my bed
sheets yeah yeah it looks like if anyone
came into my house they would think that
I'd been making like forts but no yeah
I'm going out without seas mum this
evening as Alfie's still away in Italy
and we are going to go for something to
eat and then we're going to go to
commedia to watch a film and I have
completely forgotten what the film is
called I've also been washing lots and
tidying lots because next week I have
four guests staying with me which is the
maximum amount of people I have ever had
stay with me ever I don't live in a very
big flat regardless of what you will
like to try and picture when you see
tiny little sections of it it doesn't go
on and on forever and ever
there is a spare room thankfully so I'm
having to and that's got a double bed
and then I'm having to like buy blowup
beds and things so I'm just kind of
preparing everything for the guys it's
going to be Troy Tyler Corey and Connor
and obviously Alfie will be here too and
I think Joey is coming so Joey might
have to stay with Alfie I'm not really
too sure how it's going to work
I think Tania and Jim are coming down
I'm not really sure how that's gonna
work but we'll have to just cram
everyone in I know what I was going to
tell you hello
okay so here's Percy oh right well that
was good then he was chilling on his
little sofa now he's gone under the
hammock burn down here is Pippin little
Pippin hey boy I gave Crippen a bath
last night because as you can see he has
long hair and I have actually trimmed it
recently and it's already growing back
oh well that was rude
I can still see you oh you've pooped in
there that's not for pooping in Pippin
that's for sleeping in I don't know if
you're going to understand what I'm
saying but no pooping just sleeping okay
cool glad glad we're on the same page I
don't poop in my bed
you don't poop in your bed life lessons
with Pippin so I've tidied in my desk
area I have some cute things here and
just some pics and this is what I'm
doing this week clearly not phony oh is
that organized
I bought this lamp which I really like I
don't see that it's on and I also put
fairy lights all around here tonight
when I get back in and it's dark I'll
show you I'll show you with them with
all the lights on this is our happy
place I really like this sign it reminds
me to be happy and maybe I do like um
a kind of desk area tour I'm not sure
it's not really that interesting so
after he bought me a bike for my
birthday and I want to show you it
because I love it
let me just turn the light on oh that
made a whole lot of difference here it
is oh my god I am in love actually let
me
this is Felix's coat he left it at
alfea's when they filmed together so
Alfie brought it round here for him to
come and collect but he hasn't so Felix
if you're watching this I've still got
your jacket I'll put it here it's in
safe hands
oops nearly dropped it so this is my
bike it is a
Ashleigh which is the one I really
really wanted I've never seen these
colours before it's basically like it
reminds me of an ice-cream because it's
the cream and the baby pink and it has
just a really cool saddle and a basket
and the little cute handles and the bell
which I think sounds slightly eerie I've
also sorted out my makeup storage and
collection so that is going to be a
video on my main channel don't get too
excited it's probably not that great
but a lot of you have asked for it so
that's what i'ma do right this has
probably been filming now 400 good 15
minutes so I think I'll meet up after
showing you this I kind of couldn't
resist wanting to go inside it so let's
go
he I'm going in
oh god was that worth it
no how tell you what oh my floors not
that comfortable neither is this stall
let's get out of here what am i doing
with my life okay I'm getting out of it

grotto at nighttime with both

twinkly lights guys amazing that's how
much I love fairy lights good night do

of light when you need a poopa you can't
