good morning everybody welcome to
blogeee my fake love
I feel like you haven't been in my vlog
for like the past couple of days how did
you hear my knuckles was that your
knuckle he's clumsy
how are you Alfie tell me how are you
feeling oh good I look so good have you
mm-hmm
oh yeah you've got really round eyes
like in your eye you can see a lot of
the white around it do you see what I
mean
what depends that wide-open eye but
thank you like this then you come but
open your eyes as wide as you can
I knew you would do that you're so
annoying
it's been a busy morning here in the
south we household Mia now for your up
the bed is made we're both showered I've
got my vlog ready to go it's all
scheduled and I have my main channel
almost done it's actually one of my
favorites so far I really hope you like
it you will have already seen it I'll
leave a link to it in the description
box though it's the gift wrapping ideas
video and I filmed it with Snoopy and I
just really really liked it I'm really
happy with it and I loved it all these
presents here and I just loved how it
turned out so I really hope that you
guys enjoyed it and also I don't really
do many kind of DIY type videos so I
hope it was okay I'm currently making
this bedroom all nice and ready for
Louise and Darcy because they are coming
to stay tonight for the annual Louise
and Darcy Christmas giving day and I'm
really excited louise hasn't been here
in what feels like so long and she's
actually doing her first drive to my
house because normally she gets the
train but she's been pushing herself out
of our comfort zone recently on road
trips so this is going to be her first
driven road trip to the house on her own
so I'm going to be very impressed when
she arrives we're going to be filming
the gift-giving I know that lots and
lots and lots of you have been asking me
on Twitter if it's happening you're all
really excited
the prospect that it might happen and
yes we are and I think that this will be
the third year in a row that we've done
it so I'm really really excited I do
however need to finish wrapping her
presents because I haven't done that yet
and another one of Darcy's presence has
just been delivered so I need to go and
wrap that as well but I'm really excited
for her to arrive and I feel like
they're going to really love the bedroom
got some fresh towels got the bed all
made got the lights on the Christmas
tree
it's festive Haven I don't know if I've
shown you guys this room either but this
is our second spare bedroom and I've got
this all decorated Christmassy too just
because you know why not but I don't
know whether Louise will share a bed
with Darcy or whether Darcy will come
into this room but either way both the
bedrooms are already I love this Maps
fix everything although you know what
because I sometimes nap and it actually
makes me feel worse like I wake up with
like a groggy feeling so not sure I
completely agree with that but I'm
loving the second festive bedroom Oh in
case any of you are wondering these
sheets are also from Asda
look they've got a really cute little
like winter village the little banner is
from next the picture is from I think
not on the high street or Etsy little
Christmas tree from next and the
decorations are also from next and
little Ruby Ruth doll Malcolm yeah
there you go that's the the second
bedroom which may or may not get used we
don't actually know yet but it's good to
have it and it's just another excuse me
to have another Christmas tree to be
honest guys I'm just wrapping up some of
really the stocking presents I just
wanted to show you this like amazing
invention by sell a date not sponsored
legit just like it so you know that
really annoying thing that you sort of
do all this and then you do this and

foot
