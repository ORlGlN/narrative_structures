boom not gonna lie this is actually the
second time I see on this video because
the first time the microphone was half
in half out so I had no sound so I'm
going to rebuild it and thank heavens I
didn't move any of my stuff the camera
was still here the battery was still
here the lighting was still here we're
good we're all good
okay I also want to apologize for my
really bad off center parting I tried to
do this to my hair earlier and because I
never wear my hair at center parting I
find it so hard to actually get my
Center parking right so I'm sorry if
that offends you he's very off-center
maybe I should have just kind of like
styled it out and be like this is what I
wanted to do but then I'd be lying to
myself and to you so this isn't what I
intended but I'm just going to deal with
it now anyway
some of you may have already seen
yesterday at 6:00 p.m. I was able to let
you guys know of a very exciting launch
within zoella beauty and now I get to
share with you what exactly is in that
launch and why I love it and a little
bit of backstory and probably just me
rumbling and being excited about my new
products which generally is what these
types of videos are so I hope you enjoy
it as you may know so Anna Beauty
launched back in 2014 with a classic
scent I'm calling it the classic scent
because it's the cool collection that's
available year in year out
all throughout the year it's kind of the
main range I guess within Zola Beauty I
would say that the classic scent was
definitely one of the hardest cents to
pick because I knew that that would be a
sin that would kind of carry through so
even though there's going to be you know
or new exciting sense and the kind of
more limited collections and gifting
collections the classic scent is what is
always going to be available and it's
going to kind of be that call zoella
Beauty scent and so I found that very
hard to pick but it makes me so
incredibly happy that so many of you
still love it and to this day it's still
so many people's favorite scent which
just makes me do this thank heavens I
made a good choice I actually still
bloody love it it brings back so many
memories
and it just holds a real dear place in
my heart because it is my first kind of
beauty scent and it kind of was the
first thing that launched because it was
one of the first collections that
launched I feel like as time has gone by
and we've kind of brought out lots of
new exciting ranges alongside it it was
time to kind of freshen it up add some
new products and you know at the end of
last year we added quite a few new
products the collection then so we added
pretty polished scoopa duper we have a
hand sanitizer and now I'm adding some
more so without further ado I'm going to
semi quickly chat you through some of
the new items that are available now
online on super drug calm and feel
unique calm so I will leave a link in
the description box below so you can go
and check out but they're online now and
they will be available in store from
Monday the 3rd of April so you don't
have to long to it where you can
actually go in store and kind of touch
them and fill them but for those of you
that cannot get to the store or you
don't have a store near you or you just
can't wait till the bird I'm going to
show you now so you can order online one
of my favorite things ever is a large
makeup bag I'm so paranoid on microphone
now it is plugged in one of the things I
absolutely love about this is the size
of it you can store product upright you
can get so much in here but it's also
just such a lovely quality got copper
lid handle and it's in this lovely
canvas material with little copper polka
dots the little legs down there sunny
story I've actually been using this for
a couple of months and some of you did
actually notice it in my blog see that's
where that's where all these products
have been trialing and testing and using
that's where you'll see them first if
you've got like eagle eyes if you look
closely you might see me using some of
the products in either pre-production
samples or mass production samples so I
have been using this for quite a while
already but now you can get your hands
on it as well so yay then we've also got
a kind of more medium sized bag you guys
love this size because it's great for
makeup but it's also a great pencil case
guys I love this so much it's good for
if you have like a backpack or you're
traveling it's just perfect and you've
got the little like Coralie colors it
and it says fairest of them all which I
love a lot and I sounded like Alice been
from Vicar of Dibley did blue and it has
black polka dots and again it's in this
really lovely canvas I just love this
it's great very excited about all these
products okay and then because you guys
also really like 5th size we thought it
would be nice to bring back this size
purse this has also got a little bit of
canvas on it and then it's also wrapped
in the really lovely copper kind of faux
pleather II feel fabric again you've got
some polka dots on the back and it says
no filter needed which i think is a
really lovely quote because we're all
beautiful even without filters how many
of you deserve octave and also perfect
that size is perfect for handbag handbag
school bag you name it keep all your
like essential kind of everyday bits and
pieces of mask the next thing I'm trying
to share with you is our good old
classic friend soap opera which I feel
like is just want to be like more
classic items I guess like this has been
here from day one but you may noticed
it's had a bit of a shrink down and that
is because the other bottle as much as I
love it and I love having more of the
product wasn't as good for travel so
we've kind of slimmed it down lighter on
the old purse strings coin strings purse
better for your purse because it's
cheaper but it also easier to travel
with because it's now more slimline and
this next one makes me so happy because
as part of the last Christmas
gifting collection you have the option
to buy all the body mists in mini
glass
tools which are just anything in mini
basically I'm obsessed with so we
decided to bring back three minis into
the classic range so that you can get
these all year round
so for any of you that miss out on those
at Christmas you are in for a treat
because you can now get the Sweet
Inspirations the Bristol missile and the
let's Britt in mini sizes this is just
the box but how cute is the packaging I
love it and here are the minis so we've
got the mini blissful missile and
they're all exact replicas so they all
look exactly the same they have the same
design the same lid the same scent and
then we've got these sweet inspirations
so cute love it and the lip spritz which
I have to say it's still one of my
favorite like spring summer scent I just
love it
and actually I am going to own horn and
say that even though these are body
mists they're so strong in scent they're
essentially perfumes because they're
really really highly fragrant which
makes them perfect on the go spritzing
if you like me and you like things in
miniature form I would advise that you
check those out especially if you have
all of the sense but they're not as easy
to travel with because they're glass
bottles
oldest paper alright so it is those
other good things come in threes so all
of those products available third of
April in stores online mouth this next
product though you're going to have to
wait a little bit longer for because it
is almost ready to hit the shelves and
it is going to be part of the same
classic cool range it's just that this
has had to have far more testing in fact
we were working on this product now for
like probably nearly two years I want to
say it's been a long long time and it
was one of those products that I really
really fought for and there were so many
times where we were like maybe this just
isn't going to happen it took a lot of
testing a lot of different formulations
many different scent combinations that
did not work and now we finally have it
as a perfect product I could not be more
excited and more proud of it I
absolutely love it so this next product
will be going in to store and online on
the 16th of April and it is good
listener it's a bath and shower oil how
flipping exploiting this is definitely
something that I've always wanted to do
because I love using shower oils they
feel real luxurious they're really great
on your skin and it just feels like a
real treat I think and one of the things
that I absolutely love about kind of
baths and showers and different products
that you can use for that I'm just
creating like a nice kind of I don't
know and just like kind of looking after
your body it has those products that
feel a little bit more special at like a
less price so that is why I thought
having a shower oil would be really
lovely because it is a little bit more
of a treat for your skin but it's just
so lovely to use I absolutely love this
so much it actually has a slightly
different scent for the classic range so
yeah you should definitely check it out
give it a sniff and see what you think
oh I love it
personally I love it it smells like
holiday I thought what the hell is that
what oh my god the pigeons are some
mustard pigeons on the roof if any of
you watch my other vlogs then you may
see the one where we heard banging like
constant banging and I was like and I
was like that's so weird
turns out I think it's the pigeon anyway
yes
this oil 16th of April I'm so happy with
it it's been through a lot of testing a
lot of trying now it's ready to go and
that makes me so happy it's really weird
when you've been working on something
for so long and then finally it gets to
a point where you can hand it to people
and they can actually use it it's like
so satisfying and it's so like I don't
know it's a weird feeling it's a really
weird feeling but I love it and I really
think you guys are going to love this a
lot so I'm very excited to have my own
shower and bath oil there you go those
are all the new products as I said the
majority of those are available now
online so I will leave the links to
superglue unique below and yeah let me
know which one you're most excites try
or if you're going to buy any or if
you've already bought any because they
should go on sale yesterday and once
they go into store be sure to tweet me
some pictures because I absolutely love
seeing those and yeah and let me know
what you think because you guys are
obviously very very important in all of
this and thank you so much for your
support and basically enabling me to
live out like the most amazing dream
ever and that is to pick and design and
sell my own beauty products like it
really is still a dream come true and I
pinch myself on the regular and I think
today is one of those days now I'm flat
head filming this being like I have a
shower oil it's so weird like it is so
weird I'm never just I'm never going to
get used to this I don't think but it
makes me so incredibly happy I love
working on this I love all the time that
goes into it
I love seeing your reactions and it
really doesn't mean the world to me
that you guys kind of enable me to be
able to do this and that you love it too
that's the main thing my biz just popped
and there's another siren what is
happening today pigeon
sirens give the video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and I cannot wait to share
with you some of the other really new
and exciting launches in both solar
beauty and the lifestyle throughout the
coming months towards the end of the
year so stay tuned for those and I will
see you again very very soon bye bye
