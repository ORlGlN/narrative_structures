gonna give them that prezis which I'm
really excited about Anna's presents I
hope they open them on camera though do
you remember honest presence that we got
her yeah now I remember I remember one
of them basically we've just thought
everyone joki presence we've all can see
what I'm saying
why oh yeah they'll see it so when we
were in TK Maxx a while ago we saw this
pal she came back so if you don't have
it wherever you live so is the most
random stuff like you go in there one
day and you're like I love that t-shirt
going there next to you like it's gone I
love that plant yeah there's a lot of
random stuff around for Americans it's
t.j.maxx oh do they have in America okay
um we found this like Paris pets I don't
know she was like this big wide haircut
I look like a blown boiled egg we need
to tidy up a little bit - I hate that
the house is like not messy for
Christmas up there isn't it it is messy
I don't like the front door we need to
tackle that there yeah the porch area
which is basically where my PA car
yesterday is that I well I like my girl
out last night and I just wanted to quit
even worse what your car is full of
people I know I need to get it out today
oh my gosh she was so much I know yes I
had a bath this morning so I'm feeling
fresh washed my hair just curled it
which I don't normally get those for you
but I like it what in your house oh god
guys tonight last night after I finished
my vlog
Nalla threw up on the bed and I can't
cope with throw-up
like I just can't I've got like a huge
phobia of it and Alfie wasn't here
because he was out and I was like what
do I do
oh my god and it wasn't just a little
bit it wasn't just a little bit it was
like full-on Papa dog sit proper dog
sick all on the bed on the bed sheets
so because Alfie wasn't here I was like
right I can do it I can do this he tells
me a picture fast no it was after I
cleared out actually um folks yeah so I
cleared it all up myself
I genuinely like not even lying this
sounds like a lying with the imprint
girls and dipping them in the hummus
when I text you that picture huh I'm
joking
well I was actually really proud of
myself like I'm not joking I'm like
full-on really proud of myself I was
able to do that because it shows that
when you actually have to do something
you can do it like even if you're
terrified of it if it's the outlet I'm
knob viously not going to leave it on
the end of the bed until you get home at
5 a.m.
can you imagine you just roll in and I'm
asleep in bed and there's a little pile
of dog sick on the end of the day you're
just in the other bed yeah y-yeah are
the doctor now oh I didn't think of that
they know anyway yesterday after end the
vlog um yeah I think she gets too hot
sometimes and just throws up but anyway
I need to film a video so I'm gonna
leave you to get up Alfie look at I know
she's so cute even you little bed I was
doing my makeup and she came and code up
on my lap it was so cute right yeah I
said around 3 or 4 so it's about a bit
of time and I am gonna feel more I'm
gonna really miss this Christmassy room
oh it's nearly over Alfie I don't want
it to be over I love Christmas
okay I finished my filming my video and
now I'm going to put a pizza in the oven
if I go out and have pizza in a while
actually most unlike me and it's one of
these I love these Chicago Town take
away 4 cheese melt mmm
buy pizzas see you soon when you look
delicious now time to wrap Anna and
Jonathan's presents and Amelia and
Eduardo's presents you're gonna come
help me out lots to wrap I forgot how
many we bought them like it's a bit
ridiculous and most of them are jokes so
it's kind of like are they really good
to keep them um but it's all fun isn't
it it's all in the spirit of Christmas
the most fun time of the year there's
only three days and daughter is vers I'm
so sad about that I just wish this would
last at least two months I think two
months of Christmas build-up is good
Alfie's helping me now have you wrapped
any presents yet this year this 1,000
I've got rapidly for that return as I
send you I really needed I know but I
feel like I have enough wrapping paper
now for the two hours I don't really
mind phones ring in I'll carry on oh you
need your special Widger you need to
wear it a set there we go I love that
salad date thing sure with that well
done
I find it weird I want to like take it
off I know do you wear it up ah but I
could go to one way look what we've got
media on Eduardo to share frozen sing
with Elsa and a microphone because at
the moment I've noticed in the vlogs
Emilia is singing frozen like all the
time so she had her own frozen
microphone and also because Eduardo
loves that doesn't a yes yes I think
everybody's more tests replace I'm
taking nothing off more social closer
than media
let's get out I'm actually normally this
wrapping paper to be fair is very stiff
silence knowledge so it does make it a
bit hard that that's not too bad
well dams right it's really solid yeah
yes thick you've only got three more
presents to wrap after this one no and
then I got everyone's yeah but before we
go to Anna and Jonathan's yeah that's
