good morning guys I haven't logged in so
long and I miss it I'll miss you yes I
do so decided I would vlog today
look all the winter coats that's where
we store our winter coats and actually
it's really wintery outside today it's
raining and dreary and as me and Alfie
went out this morning we were like oh my
goodness it feels like autumn a little
bit null has gone to the vets but not
for anything bad we are getting her
spayed basically but she's having
keyhole surgery how amazing is that that
they can do that on dogs so we took her
in this morning at called +8 and it was
really weird I thought I would be really
emotional but she was so okay that I
wasn't and I know she'll be fine anyway
it's just I don't know I've never been
responsible for something having a
surgery before and it is kind of a big
surgery although it's keyhole which is
apparently a lot safer and a lot quicker
for her to recover from but I don't know
she's my she's my little baby and it was
just weird leaving her and now we've got
an empty house and that's weird too
it's like oh my god is this what our
life was like before Nala cuz I don't
remember it I really don't me and Alfie
have got a meeting at 10 a.m. so we are
about to leave for that which I'm very
excited about just going to quickly chat
a little bit about PLL because I watched
the season 6 mid summer finale yesterday
and I just don't know how I feel about
it
Oh PS spoiler alert skip ahead I will
have left a little thing so that you
people can skip because I don't want to
ruin it for anyone but I also really
want to talk about it because topic of
discussion
so how did you feel about it because I
love pretty to liars but I've only
invested about nine months of my life to
it um because I had a marathon PLL like
catch up session basically so I haven't
invested five years of my life into the
show but I kind of feel like if I had I
would have been quite disappointed with
it um I think that it was a good episode
I think it was gripping and it did make
me go home um but then that was kind of
it like people like how did you feel
about it I'm like I was surprised but I
wasn't really shocked
I wanted to be shocked that's the only
way I can really explain it like there's
just so many things that don't remake
sense now um you probably would have
already seen them all online and I don't
know I didn't really want it to be CC
I'd seen all the theories that everyone
had come up with and some of them I'm
like they would have been so freaking
good and the like spoiler video where
people said it was Ren I was like oh I
hope it isn't Ren but now I wish that it
was Ren because it just would have made
more sense I feel like and I would have
been a little bit more interested in his
story than CC is like the minute CC
turned around I was like it's the
transgender story and um and then I
immediately knew and although it's a
cool story um I kind of the minute I saw
her face I was like oh I just don't feel
like CC has enough ammunition to be that
angry maybe it Kenneth
but can you scoff lightly like Kenneth
also really like tortured by CC until
like season 6 a little bit um so I don't
know why she wasn't more angry at
Kenneth I think that's my main question
why would Cece not really hang on the
the liars didn't really do anything to
CC they were actually quite nice to Cece
so I I don't know like I think I just
kind of wished it was a bit more of a
manipulative evil story I think
I don't know but then that's like the
hora fanatic in me going well I wanted
to be more juicy and I wanted it to be a
bit more like oh my god I can't believe
it but I wasn't really like that so let
me know what you think I still love it
I'm still going to watch like the rest
to find out what happens especially
because the end was so strange I was
like who is he who is he
Big Brother reference although that was
who is she which is how I felt when I
saw Sara Harvey PS I was like what no
that was disappointing I was really
disappointed with that bit I was like
Sara Harvey got two characters but Sara
Harvey is like just a girl that went
missing the same time as Allie like in a
different town like she's just not
really any relevance to anything my
camera battery died so now I'm stolen
one of Alfie's what I was saying was
that my favorite bit was when Emily
punched Sara Harvey in the face I was
like yes Emily
so are you nearly ready for a meeting
Alfie's editing how's life without
without your baby why didn't I know
about my baby oh I oh my god i legit
thought you were wearing when I will
nineties chokers then those good weather
these days like this that looks so weird
right on your head um yeah it's weird
without gnarley' isn't it
it's quiet yeah that's right there's no
one on the sofa with me here or
squeaking toys or like anyone to live
count lately look at what sneezing on me
she sneezed on the woman oh yeah like
she was like I just want to check her
breathing no what was it I don't know
something she had to be facing as you
say
yeah she's what like pugs do pug pigs
pokes do that quite a lot I don't know
what it means some of its frustration
like sometimes are not know that she
doesn't have this yeah she just did it
in the vets face I was like oh sorry
Bella for about that
so ah okay ready to go should we get one
aversion really but we have to go about

important date no time to say hello

sometimes I come across the weirdest
crap literally my mum's just linked me

just saw in a magazine so well as
bathmat crisis okay so either someone
took that picture of me and my mum or a
pap followed me from my house to habitat
and then took the pictures and I came
out I don't know either way great photo
of me with my shopping bags and it says
you know you're really famous when peeps
start taking pics of you out shopping
for bath mats Zoe sugg was spotted
picking up bits at habitat for her new
house with her mum soon be time for that
housewarming we're deaf were invited
right though Zoe I just I just long
I just want to lull forever at this
firstly I wasn't buying frickin bath mat

Oh watch out here she comes she's been
shopping for some bath mats and that's
news guys I was actually shopping for

look a bit dead I'm still so blue I'm
blue da ba dee da ba die why it is so
blue if I changed the color setting or
something is there a color setting so
it's the next day as you may notice I
look slightly different um I forgot to
end yesterday's vlog because Nala was
like so like shaky and just being so
delicate and cute and we just kind of
sat with her basically and then she
slept on our bed last night because she
kept refusing to be wrapped up so she
would get cold and start shivering so he
took her upstairs and with me now for
you've got like a underlaying thing that
you can turn on like a heated sheet so
we turned that on and then put her on
top of that so she wasn't being covered
but she was still warm and then she
stepped on that bed and then Alfie had
to stay in the spare room because
neither took up Alfie side of the bed
and also he can't stand when the heat of
thing is on because it was really hot
and I quite like being hot I'm very cold
blooded person so I didn't mind it too
much but then we got up in the middle of
the night with her and took her outside
to the toilet and just basically been
looking after you haven't we but you're
much better today she's much more
herself she's been playing with her toys
she's been eating fine and she's been
drinking you gonna show them that you're
okay
now you're feeling better today is you
on yes you're it was so weird yesterday
like I've never seen her so like spaced
out and chilled because she's not a
chilled dog at all we took her into the
vets who like yeah normally she's pretty
nutty and the vet was like well I was
gonna be polite but that's what I'd
heard but she's quite nutty I was like
yes nutty Nala so basically I just
wanted to do this little clip at the end
of this video to say not as doing well
and
and you're fine basically because I
didn't I just ended it and also another
very exciting thing that obviously girl
online paperback came out on the 13th

excited but you're reading the first few
chapters of girl alignment or just in
