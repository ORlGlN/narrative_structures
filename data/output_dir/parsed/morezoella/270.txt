fastest selling debut novel since

records began look at jokes yep I don't
know when the records began but that is
1980s say 1980s and it is the fastest
selling hardback of 2014 so I like I
literally can't believe it
I was sat with Alfie and Jonas that was
like wow that's not real that's not true
it's in all the newspapers and stuff so
it is true and that's crazy so thank you
so much to everyone who's bought it and
for your support and I really hope you
are enjoying it and if you finished it I
hope you liked it are you sorry there

I've missed the view of the sea and
there's the West Pier and there's the
other pier it's very nice it's a massive
room though what happens input meetings
all very exciting lots of things flying
around lots of ideas I've hid in my
notes so that you can't see me so whilst
making my scone I've done Jam first and
then I'm going to do cream second and
Amy tells me that one way is the Devon
way and one way is the Cornish way so
which way if I just done it because I
have no idea
skunk talk then you found out I found
out so the corners say they make their
cream better so they always put the
cream on top because it's prop they're
proud of it and Devon should Devonian
czar slightly ashamed of their so they
cover it up with Jam do they make good
Jam though huh great Jam

now four is it almost four o'clock so
they've been very productive very
successful and really excited I have so
many ideas for book number two for girl
on line there look it's like it feels
really good to get them down on paper
and to just sit and chat through them
all and see what works and see kind of
how far I can take the book it's so
weird because I feel like now that you
guys are like invested in the characters
I don't want anything horrible to happen
I was saying to muddy like imagine if I
just killed off one of the characters
and I'm like no I can't do that but the
power I have right now to be able to do
that is quite funny

was like oh my god someone's coming and
we have cakes left hmm I think we should
take these back yeah
Oh have you oh mighty you we are one in
brain um this is called a French breast
