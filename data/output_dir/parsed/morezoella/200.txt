this bear okay guys so we've just
finished watching the bake-off final and
dr. Foster I think dr. Foster was
actually the last episode because it
kind of tied in a lot of stuff although
there's only been five episodes so I'm
kind of sad that that could mean that
there's no more bake-off for no more dr.
Foster anymore what am I going to do for
Wednesday's um but it was a make both
were amazing Bake Off was amazing I'm
really happy with who won I'm not going
to give it away just in case any of you
haven't seen it but dr. Foster was in
same be good Maddy and Alfie hadn't seen
any of the others I kept trying to tell
Alfie to watch it with me and he was
like no no I just didn't show any
interest in it and then through this
whole episode they were both just like
no what II was like oh my god that was
amazing I was like I kept trying to tell
you it was really good um so if any of
you haven't seen that then go on BBC
iPlayer and see if you can find like the
whole five episodes and watch them I
don't think there's another one there
might be I haven't checked but it just
it's
seemed quite like a final episode that
we just watched so yeah it was very very
good
I loved both it was a very explosive
evening of television very very happy
anyway I hope you've enjoyed today's
video thank you so much for watching
give it thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
I will see you again very soon but good
night
