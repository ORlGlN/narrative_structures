good morning everybody welcome to
vlogmas day what days they're not miss a
day seven
it's very early in fact it's still dark
outside freeze off
wait are you dressed yeah Alfie's off oh
look knee you you ready to go outside I
think she's confused
she said why are you awake probably
think you're going on holiday yeah
that's the only other time we get up
what time is it why is it so dark puppy
it's actually 655 so it's not like
ridiculous pedestrian Allah put this
tree on yeah yeah I was just saying to
alfie when I was younger
and it was like December he's like I
keep getting distracted yeah I was just
saying to alfie when I was younger and
it was like Christmastime in December it
was so nice when it was still dark out
and you got up for school
mum would always go downstairs and turn
on all like the Christmassy lights so
the whole house felt so magical when you
woke up because it was like oh you could
see was like all the Christmas lights
whilst Alfie is out I'm actually gonna
make a star on some Christmas wrapping
oh there he goes
so I brought down one of the box of
presents I've already bought I've got
myself a mint tea in my anthropology mug
which can I just say is like the cutest
mug I ever did see
I love it cut me right now and I'm gonna
start wrapping presents but I've got
Miracle on 34th Street on the TV because
I haven't watched that this year and I'm
gonna thoroughly enjoy this normally I
wake up and the first thing I do is edit
the vlog but I'm gonna do this this
morning because I feel like it and
because I haven't got a very busy day so
I know I can edit the vlog a bit later
when your breakfast come on then
kimberlyn got all my wrapping paper
ready also just in case any of you
haven't seen this is mine and Joe sugg
life jumper it's like one of my favorite
things ever I absolutely love it it has
everything you would want in a Christmas
jumper I don't know if we still have any
left I'll leave a link to the website
just in case we do
this is all the present wrapping I have
done so far I don't know how this has
taken me all morning I think because I
like to make them look quite nice but
yeah it's going quite well so far let's
have a look who's this one for all this
one's the poppy he's this one for Tanja
he yeah all getting wrapped love it it's
so therapeutic to sit and wrap presents
so pleased that I haven't just left this
until Christmas Eve this year because
normally myself and Alfie are like under
huge time pressure to wrap all these
presents the day before Christmas Day
but no not this year this year I am
going to be prepared and I'm going to
wrap some presents every single day guys
I feel like all I've done today and it's
starting to get dark that's when you
know like this is all you've done is sit
here and edit so I edited the vlog then
I started editing my November favorites
which I did want to perhaps sooner but I
just have not had the chance this
filming and editing everyday thing I
don't know how daily vloggers do it and
I say this every December but honestly I
think maybe I also don't do myself any
favors because I film so much footage
like today I had over an hour's worth of
footage and that means it takes me at
least to to edit because I go through it
take stuff out re-watch it but yeah I
mean don't get me wrong I bloody love it
and what makes it so so worth it is how
much you guys are loving vlogmas so far
it makes me really really happy so I'm
so pleased you're loving it also I just
checked there are still some jumpers
left in stock so if you want to get one
of these they are limited there's not
that many left if you want one before
Christmas or you want to get one for
someone as a Christmas present in time
for Christmas go down to the link in the
description box and order one right now
because they will be gone and when
they're gone they're gone and I feel
like all the cool people will be wearing
this
on Christmas Day I'm actually really
excited to see if anyone was it's on
Christmas Day if you do wear this on
Christmas Day if you have this jumper
please tag me on Instagram so I can see
it I would love that
anyway I'm gonna get back to editing my
November favorites and I think then I'm
gonna go and like sort myself out
because me now if you're going out
tonight and also I really want to open
the Joey and Daniel gift box which it's
been fat staring at me all day and I'm
like no when I finish editing when I
finished editing then I'll do it and of
course I've had my little trusty
companion with me all day sleeping on
the Christmas blanket know oh my god I
love her so much
anyway I'm gonna try and finish this
edit get this up go and get ready start
the day at 4 p.m. a spruce myself up
feeling so much more fresh and now it is
time before heading off to the cinema
with Alfie to open this package from
Joey Daniel I am so excited I don't know
where to do it though oh my god it's so
