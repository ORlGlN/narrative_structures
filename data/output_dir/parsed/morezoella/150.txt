good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 24 ie Christmas Eve ie the
last vlogmas
of this year
you
this morning me and Alfie have been kind
of tying up loose ends I wrapped up
Alfie's presents which are in here
there's Alfie Freddy's basically
everyone's cousins got friends Christmas
edition on
Alfie's cleaner Ginny's having fun there
I mean I'm literally shoveling poop
cleaning out the guinea pigs is like a
mammoth task it takes so long because
their cage is so big but a lot of you
wanted to see them again so here they
are just leaving him I'm about to fill
this up by the way I'm not a cruel
parent but he's just got a dandy loading
carrot stick and Percy is munching on
some hay so nice boy I'm travelling boo
yay Alfie shoveling poo Nala bear we're
gonna give her a little wash down last
thorough bath she doesn't really need a
thorough pass but we just want to be
nice and clean for Christmas day don't
we
so we're gonna give her a bar which is
probably a good thing I think she'll get
it in a minute when I put her in here
all in all it's been a good Christmas
Eve so far all our videos are scheduled
all the videos are done and ready we are
heading over to alphas parents house in
probably around 2 hours time and where
the festivities will begin I kind of
wanted to make some cookies before going
but I don't know if I'm going to have
time we'll see we'll see there we go
we've got one very clean pup and the
boys cage is all done we put some of the
little hay cookies in there they got
some hay they're seed they've also got
this little like Christmas tree cute a
little dandelion thing and then down
here they've got with their favorite
balls and a little Christmas star and a
tunnel which I knew Pippin would be in
because whenever we have tunnels he
literally just lives inside the tunnels
hey pip love and life in the tunnel look
at my little festive bow and I got my
little festive lip it's now half three
the day seems to have completely
disappeared and I haven't really filmed
much so I'm sorry about that but we
haven't really been doing much just like
packing the car which right now is so
full thankfully we only have to go five
minutes around the corner but we've been
packing up the car packing up knowledge
bits and pieces basically just
remembering everything that we've
prepared for this entire day for about a
month um so yes Alfie's putting the last
few bits in the car now and then we're
going to do a big advent calendar up to
date because we've forgotten and I've
just gone around the house and hidden
all his presents so I'm excited for that
I've got a little Advent candle but I
don't think that that's going to get all
the way down to 24 I've packed a couple
of little outfits for nihilus and
Christmassy outfit oh oh can you imagine
if we didn't lock the car and all our
presents got stolen
the culture we're going to cherish a
sing some carols I'm excited about that

mum and dad so literally once you've
done this advent calendar we can set up
