good morning guys my voice is a lot
better this morning thank goodness I
think I just needed a little bit of
sleep I thought I've got two things to
tell you this morning one of them you'll
be super proud of me for I've not been
to the dentist since I was 18 which um
is crazy and really bad for you um I've
never had any fillings I never had any
issues with my teeth some reason I just
have super strong teeth and I think I
just look after them really well but I
know you're supposed to go every six
months and I'm just a little bit
terrified of the dentist um I already
have anxiety around a million other
things and so the dentist was just
something that I thought I'm just going
to deal with all my other anxieties and
I think that the dentist is just going
to add to the stress so I'm going to try
and just forget that ever existed and
since I've moved here and since I have
been feeling my wisdom teeth coming
through which actually I was awake until
like half-past three last night in so
much pain I decided to look for a
dentist which for me was a major step
and I also want to find somewhere that
I'm going to feel a hundred percent
comfortable and 100% at ease because if
any of you are like me and you're a
little bit scared of the dentist then
you'll know that the actual dentist
makes a massive difference I don't know
if I need work done I don't know if I
need my wisdom teeth out but I want to
go and just make sure so I have booked
myself an appointment which for me is a
massive deal if there's any of you that
are doing the same thing I want you to
do the same and I want you to just be
brave and just do it just booked an
appointment for the dentist go you might
not need anything done but at least
you're doing it I often have dreams on
my teeth fall out of my head I actually
think that has something to do with
being insecure or something I've read on
a dream website but I want to look after
my teeth it's just that I'm scared so I
don't want to get to like thirty five
and have like the worst teeth in the
world we only get one set of teeth
unless of course you want to just have
them all ripped out and get dentures
then that's your call
but yeah
so I am a must advocate for looking off
the teeth and having nice teeth except I
try and do it all myself when in reality
as you get older you can't do that and
you actually do need to go visit entus
so I'm really proud of myself if you
haven't done it and you're scared please
do it and we'll do this together leave a
comment so that I know I'm not the only
one um another thing is oh sorry
dream phone dream phones out we were
going to play a tweet last night and we
didn't another thing is that I place an
order online with Tesco because I
watched Gabi you may have seen her in
one of my previous Rox
she did a homework hall and obviously
I'm still looking for things to put in
my home and she bought some amazing
things from Tesco so I placed the
delivery some of this stuff came with it
I'll probably do a home where all
because I could still use like mugs and
things you know sort of like you build
up a collection of those things I always
think and I was massively disappointed
that they not only just rung my buzzer
and didn't actually bring it to my flat
they just left it in the like for a part
I don't really know what it's called hmm
so I was like I just buzzed the guy into
the building and I he's not here
I then kind of bring the box up and I'm
like hmm this doesn't sound right it
sounds like something's broken so I took
a picture of the outside because there
was no like fragile stickers on there
just in case they thought I was crazy
and that I was making it up I don't
opened it to see this I also very nearly
really hurt myself so I'm like super
unimpressed that's three things in there
that are broken
three balls three mixing bowls four
cupcakes or whatever I don't even know
what was going to make with them so um I
guess I'll be emailing them I would
quite like my balls in in one piece and
it just it was crazy they were just in
the box
like they weren't wrapped anything I
nearly cut my hand um and you know you
just have that feeling when you pick
something up and you're like this was
not traveled
carefully it sounded like that basically
when I picked it up so just go I'm not
happy with you but also please package
things we're going to hurt people like
if anything like I don't really care you
can replace the balls but you can't
place fingers so yeah that's not that's
not the best service from Tesco direct
right there I think I'll go into stall
next time where we go an LP we are off
to go get some lunch at stammer house
which nice little like I say little such
a massive park near Brighton we're going

don't like this turning very much scary
