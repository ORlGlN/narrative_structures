to bed because it was really late
such you know like it's like half 10
guys we did karaoke which is the carpark
karaoke that we did on Louise's channel
but it went really wrong and we shot it
for a gross angle and there was some
like major fails thankfully like the
police
sat and watched us for a while because
they thought we were a bit mental and
also we got bit too into Miley Cyrus
wrecking ball and I decided that it
would be appropriate forgetting we had
the lights in the car to get that and
flash my bra because Rita's going side
boob side boob trying to be all sexy
like Miley Cyrus and as I did that I
turned mood to see three boys walk past
so I turned to Louisa my tummy and then
she had the biggest freak out of her
life which you can watch on her vlog
she's going to put on a vlog yeah
because I said we can refill more songs
but you guys have got to see this
footage because it's the best excuse me
