hello everybody not doing it it's just
so much pressure
hello everybody welcome to vlogmas day
what are you doing this morning mark
today I'm making half the Enzo breakfast
we haven't asked you to just to clarify
it will I get to work on your cape no I
thought it'd be a nice little gesture Oh
lovely I was editing your way and you
went I'm gonna make you breakfast
morning Oh what do you need any help
folks I feel really like I know you love
to like help no I don't know you love to
have control I like yeah we are going
today for cheesy eggy beans on bagels
mm-hmm
this is a nightmare this is why you do
it into a bowl because then you mix all
the eggs together and then you just pour
it in ah one two right one should not
mean yeah a quick stir turn the heat
down a man you read my mind
good a woman makes it so you may have
heard of best fiends because Alfie and
Joe are literally obsessed with it but
they got in contact with me and wanted
to work with me on a video and of course
I really wanted to because now he's been
playing it and I really genuinely liked
it so how she likes to play best scenes
forever and I like the classic best
fiends which is what I have been playing
so I just want to show you what I've
been doing so far have you got this mark
I think you'd really like it it's
essentially a free puzzle game and you
collect and upgrade characters so he has
been upgraded to level 5 I worked very
hard on this guy I think he's so cute
it's like he's got little pigtails he
also looks like something Joe would have
used catching rubes I quite like it look
it's all Christmassy right now I love it
it's all snowy and there's like little
candy canes and sleighs okay so I'm
currently level 34 so I need to defeat
seven slugs and
collect whatever's in this box this is
also a bomb and you join the leaves and
then that powers up your character which
then defeats the slugs
I'll look he's in a sleigh I love it you
can connect your game up to Facebook
which means that you can compete with
all your friends and you can check out
where they are on the lead board you can
see if you're any better than them
yay okay I've got two left and I've got
16 moves to do it I reckon I can do it I
can hear you soaring away back there
Markey alright oh look at Nala waiting
for any bits of cheese that mark drops
its breakfast nearly ready how exciting
anyway oh no I got one slug to defeat
before breakfast
oh I do it I'll leave a link in the
description box where you can download
the app for free let me know what level
you're on see if you can beat me and
also how jealous are you office
breakfast Chuck well done mark love it's
