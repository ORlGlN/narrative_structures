good morning everybody it is Monday my
favorite day of the week because I am
crazy I spent all morning cleaning our
kitchen not just hiding it but cleaning
it kitchens and bathrooms are just the
worst to clean and tidy they take so
flippin long also I've used a different
concealer today and I'm just not sure
about it I think it's the wrong shade
basically it looks fine in natural light
but when I go into shadow I look very
orange
it's the Urban Decay Naked concealer
which actually is up there with one of
my Holy Grail concealers it's got the
best coverage for sure but I just feel
like it looks like patchy not sure about
that I also bothered with eye shadow
today which I never do hello buzzy I
always like flooring my ass yeah so I
never bother with eye shadow at the
moment but when I was doing my makeup
just now I thought you know what I'm
actually going to and it was sort of the
video I filmed with Jo that prompted me
to because the eye shadow palettes have
stood out and I was like oh I'm just
going to use one I'm just going to do a
little bit of blending Gordano secret I
haven't brushed my hair today anyways we
head and curly haired girl out and know
which I guess I'm neither well I don't
really know I don't ever let my hair go
natural anymore so I don't really know
what it's like natural but if I was to
brush this it would go like a free spool
so I just haven't and it's so naughty
underneath but it's not going to work
it's not going to look nice like a
little like sit on food bowls people but
you're right mate
so yeah look how clean and tidy
this kitchen is this morning I'm so
happy with it and I feel it all down
here and I shave it all around here and
I swept all this floor it took me so
long but it's done now
really happy about it it is very
satisfying what I'm going to do now is
start editing my vlog from the weekend
which I filmed but mark is coming around
today which I'm very excited about I
literally messaged him like last night
like were you doing tomorrow tractor
coming around because I haven't seen him
in so long I actually get like mark
withdrawal outfit without there and be
like just feel so lonely he's like
really and what I think it cuz I haven't
seen mark
Oh which is when you know you've made a
friend for life isn't it because if you
don't see them you actually really miss
them so I'm going to start my blog until
mark arrives I believe he is actually on
his way now
so I'll see how much I can get done but
editing blogs takes me so long it's
driving me crazy even when I'm doing it
it drives me crazy but it takes me so
long but it's because I over film so
much Amanda's coming to pick up buzz at
some point and Alfie is out at meetings
all day so yeah no plans but generally
that is the youth plan got about halfway
through my edit and there's a mark faris
at my door but I liked it where is he

it so it should might replace yes what's
the verdict started yours looks so great
it's a really close match we're now
cozied up he already looks creepy
it is mulching the film a cure for
wellness which Marx said is supposed to
be really good so you know I'm excited
about this it's a psychological horror I
think which sounds good to me you and
you know how the other day my last vlog
I said I feel like I'm getting a 100% is
happening is my nose is like a cap okay
get your crystal my healing crystal
today we talked about that okay Laurie
okay look at the gold I want a goldfish
like that in a big bowl I can't you do
say we should get popper salt fish with
coral and everything you know we will
that's like a lot of space wake up he's
having a heart attack
acid reflux he a broth right we're going
to watch then oh that's me not in the
night in bed now that film was weird I
to be fair I fell asleep like 20 minutes
in so I don't know for sure whether I
saw it all properly to understand it but
it was really weird wasn't it you able
to see the whole time tonight look at me
not really her it was a very
psychological film I think worth
watching it was it was tied under
psychological serenella yeah
is a very high magic rail it was a
comedy it required so much brain review
I feel like you need to watch it in the
daytime so you don't so that your tired
mind doesn't struggle to understand it
like minded basically too much going on
there was a lot going on but I feel like
it's also a sort of film that's going to
give me nightmares do you know what I
mean it was like those eerie things
women yeah oh god like some of the
visuals were really I had to look away
and I never have to look away from films
because I'm like it's not real it's fine
but I honestly was watching some of
those things and I was like I can't
watch this that is too intense
yeah so I what was it called again the
the world rules the wellness cure the
wellness cure the cure of wellness
remember but not are you serious you a
Mark's gone home he went home about
halfway through because he was getting
tired stop and now I need to sleep good
night everybody
say good night say good night off you
don't really I don't like it
good night good night bye
