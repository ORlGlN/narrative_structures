worst thing ever

suck in see I may be a hundred foot
pendulum and then it swung around and
round face bursts upside down oh I did
not go on that one and very pleased and
what I don't like about those is was it
just resurrected was disrupted for that
day basically yeah seems like what I'd
like they gather in like a few hours
we saw them tightening the screws just
before they go on it I'm joking I'm
chill drew yeah it's because Ana went on
that road last year and she said she's
never gonna like going on anything but
that yeah because she said that it was
at that moment she realized it was not
safe and she had kids and she was like
no dog was going yeah I think I'll go

people would enjoy the film there were
definitely some really good bit and
there was some really tense bit but I
don't know it didn't thrill me

lovely day we've enjoyed this vlog I
just uploaded my Tully's farm video with
of the shock Tober fest and lots of you
are enjoying that I think that's
actually one of my favorite vlogs I've
done in a really long time just because
we were all together and we just had so
much fun I actually forgot to end that
blog so it kind of just looks like we
died in the maze um but yeah it was like
one of my favorite days because quite a
lot of the time when we hang out with
our friends it's at like events or
launches or certain things that we all
like have to be at so we very rarely all
get to hang out and often
because we're all so busy our schedules
it's like impossible to find a time for
all of us to be available to do
something so I actually started
organizing this in July I was like guys
I really want to do this again this year
let's all put a date in the diary now
because I appreciate everyone gets
really busy and it was just so nice to
just hang out with everybody just for
fun and just you know dono there was no
agenda to it it was just literally to
have fun have a good time and I really
really enjoyed going there so yeah and
everyone else looked like they had a
really good time as well give the video
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will
see you again soon
oh my swag now
