whirlwind oh no um but Anna arrived with
the cutest dog bed I have ever seen and
you love it don't you Nala she ran over
and jumped in it it's so cozy oh my
goodness and it's so cute because
everything we have is like really gray
and bland and in pets of the look see
Jana she loves it
and this is like the cutest bit okay now
you're taking this a bit far Nala not
sure what you're doing now and but this
is like the cutest this is exactly the
sort of thing I wanted
her but pets at home kind of just have
gray and kind of spotty type ones and
she also bought some royal Canon junior
pug Edition and there was something else
oh did you see these Alfie little
bandanas yeah they're so cute little so
thank you so much Anna that and Jonathan

thinking behind that I'm not sure
Jonathan would have picked that out for
you she's loving it though even if she's
not in it she's finding it very
entertaining what are you doing what are
you doing so you know how myself and
Tanja have this debate about quality
street versus the kind of Cadbury's
Michihiro like um opposites do like
opposites so Tom's favorite a quality
street and about half an hour ago she
was like I just love the orange
creatures cousin so much because I had a
box given to me and obvious I don't like
them that much but I kept them because
the new Tom was coming and then going
through my pubic stuff I stumble upon a
little letter from quality sweet saying
we hear that you're not our biggest fan
I'm like oh no I actually still like
them they're just not my favorite yeah
um and and they were like we hope you
enjoy this giant orange cream full of
orange cream when it was basically it
was like enjoying our own ice cream like
that and we were like but now tom is
gonna go crazy and start orange creams
I'm supposed to my health kick Zoey well
it's not my fault it's cool to just read
out their origin their orange flavor
oranges are healthier oranges are
healthy I'm not sure whether those Elvis
but we just thought how funny that was
we were literally saying that earlier
and look I thought when we opened it
that's ten instead of summer cycle is
literally all my favorite ones
hey guys come one maybe I just have one
too I actually say the orange cream and
is there a strawberry cream in there
well they're my favorite one
good what's happening tom
I'm used to smoke I wake up is she weird
yeah mother let go let go let it go let
it go can't hold it back anymore let it
go let it go no okay that's not reminds
me I probably have makeup all down my
face me and Tom have just been doing
some yoga and some stretching and
distressing last give it um and Tom gave
me a massage while Jim was junk Jimmy
