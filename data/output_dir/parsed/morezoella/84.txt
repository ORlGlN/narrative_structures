good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 22
as you can see alpha Nala I still sleep
him I am on a mission
with my dad to go out and get a
McDonald's breakfast which I feel like a
sort of tradition generally when we were
younger we used to go out and get my
dogs breakfast on Christmas Eve but I
thought it would be quite nice to go out
and get one today Alf is going to stay
in bed
Joe's also still in bed he's fast asleep
so I've got the list on my phone and me
and dad are gonna go and get it I'm very
excited I don't even remember the last
time I had a McDonald's breakfast you
all staying here Missy no no I think
it's quite nice so hopefully some
Trekkies and my wife a boots what do you
think Dad brilliant would you wear this
to McDonald's oh yeah

we're just waiting on hash browns
they've got bears dad
from pirika
get too excited relax

I feel like I need to like cool down the
kids kids breakfast

people forget McDonald's do breakfast
pancakes oh that's all good and then it
comes with maple syrup don't you think
they look good yeah yeah as you can see
my dad has a lot of camera rapport
yeah I feel that maybe we did go a
little bit over the top on the
hashbrowns but never mind
does this McDonald's is here
have I got doggy in here ah good morning
oh she's so cute today
she looks tiny today do you think why I
hate looks written maybe we squashed it
breakfast is ready and warm so I would
suggest to come down now while it's
still warm
just chuck some joggers on it looks
delicious so we are about to film a
video for Jos channel what's this where
I'm gonna do his makeup
it's been a while since I've done Jo's
makeup so uh this is gonna be fun
this is our current setup we've got an
ironing board a box no actually it's a
drawer from the chest of drawers and
then the camera on top of that such a
professional setter me oh my god
bitching because I thought you were
still outside the room don't take the
mic allowed my set up all right
it's not about to defer though I don't
have wound it for four years with the
stuff I use yeah you use all my
hand-me-downs for right three years ago
I also do yeah yeah there's not anything
that I've actually purchased is this
camera right back in the day though it
was first moved to London again camera
this lens I was lucky I thought you know
what it's after I saw your lenses like
this is a good lens and it's not so
don't and do it yeah but its lens right
they did sent me two for the price of
one
why trap to these lengths I'm the lenses
for spare you should have given someone
that other present oh no you don't need
to lens it exactly you know you see you
do need a new tripod day and
time I see your tripod I'm like how is
he using that I don't know how to bike I
don't I've seen these like Fanta tripods
all the buttons research just almost
it's like the camera is at a level where
I like it you know it was the right
height well so your lighting is always
weird each is the weirdest like thing
you have much good luck URI orange what
you nothing is good I thought my
lighting is that warm and inviting
if warm and inviting it just looks
really funny when I watch you set it up
it's so like put a ring light with me we
won't need it
look at this natural light can't beat it
if any of you are new to YouTube and you
think you need fancy lights you don't
all you need is a window and a nice
bright day that's only anagen they're
super yeah but I mean if you want a
blurry background it might be nice to
have like to pay a bit more for a lens
but these days like smartphones are so
good like you can film some pretty
decent I can valuable phone no but they
sent one to Elfie
I got one as well yeah charge is fully
charged in 50 minutes
that's so good okay Wow are the cameras

photo with a viewer and I was I think it
was with a boy actually as he took the
picture I looked you know after the

about that being the most festive place

can go there and have your trip area has
a different colour thing ah different
colour though like if you were like oh I
