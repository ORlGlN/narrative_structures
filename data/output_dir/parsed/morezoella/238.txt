good morning it's the next day and it is
my five years on YouTube day which I
found out I just logged onto Twitter
that's Matt Olien I don't just have a
weird audience in my bedroom when I went
by okay so we have D fan hours she
demands it on every morning celebrate
thank you clapping for me oh and which
is really cool
have you got a room key Alfie yeah I'll
meet you down there okay we're off to
get breakfast I am hungry
you guys hungry oh well I'm always Louie
just had a baby yeah new baby this just
might be that I know nobody else who is
this happy in the morning look at his
little face just reclining in your
breakfast chair just make you want a
baby Matt already got one another one
she's not a baby anymore she's a little
lady yes she I should be my baby for I
don't know could be a buy one get one a
video that's why we'll be able to yeah
we wants the vlog looker did you read
your book last night I did I've taken
some notes you know we can see you now
really different so we're eating
breakfast hmm so much goodness on the
table
you enjoying that waffle yeah my
blueberry waffle I was just saying how
weird it would be just basically
surrounded by youtubers right now if we
all live all youtubers lived in one
massive building we've all had different
sets that was our houses and we all came
down baked like this for breakfast every
morning and every evening we had dinner
together and sometimes we went on
excursions like to playlist in VidCon I
love it I am for school like boarding
school but youtuber style people
actually can start believing that I want
they like that's a thing it's what we do
don't don't
that was my triangle Andy Manar to say
all right may all right really hot hello
Esther right they've just opened their
little Christmas presents from amazing
we got so nothing before we guilty now
I've got a pocket Louis Dora secrecy I
would love it is that the baekje let's
finish some Grayson's room oh yeah
definitely
he is Ravina yeah hello Oliver
I've missed you mother she's watching
did you teach us how to climb stairs is
that what you've done today so myself
and Amanda are taking the puppies to a
puppy socializing group at the vets
which we're very excited about and that
is the one area that Nala is kind of
lacking in because she gets very scared
around other dogs so I'm half nervous
half excited don't know how this is
gonna go I feel like our puppies are
going to be really badly behaved because
there's already been two other glasses
which we couldn't make so I hope you do
us proud and you're good boys and girls
and me and Amanda are left like oh my
god what are they doing it should be
fine I hope
look how pretty the Christmas tree looks
so pretty where you going
Oh mister it's not later now and puppy
socialising class went really well and
all that and birds were super good and
they got on reward will be other puppies
so it was really quite nice I was a bit
worried that not all would be terrified
all the police but she wasn't and some
of them were a lot bigger than her so
that's really reassuring I am now in bed
watching
Arthur Christmas which I hadn't seen
until this year and it is honestly one
of my favorite Christmas films now I
just I'm obsessed with it I love it so
much if you haven't seen Arthur
Christmas watch it it will definitely
get you in the Christmas spirit and I
just think it's a really lovely concept
like if I watch this as a kid I would I
would have believed this is how it was
done which i think is really cool Alfie
got back and we had a Nando's for dinner
with his family and then we watched 22
Jump Street I say we watched it I just
fell asleep on the sofa throughout the
entire thing I'm not very good at
watching films in the evening I'm that
person that like five minutes into the
film I'm asleep and then I wake up five
minutes towards the end and be like what
happened that is basically me so I am
going to end my vlog here good night
I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll
see you tomorrow
you
