hello hey so it's the evening and we've
had a very busy day and we basically
just been filming and editing and
uploading and more editing all day so
both of us what's the time Nashik it's
just because we just had dinner Niall is
asleep I was asleep somewhere so this is
like our chance of just having a little
cuddle without the dog actually what you

got my hair sorry about my hair she
loves to be like I'm surprised she's not
just sitting now like here but she
literally she's speak any louder she
won't feel like cruel a police and then
she just goes really slow and then just
sits in the middle um I decided to get
my camera out right now and start
vlogging because I like watching friends
know there's a difference between no no
there's a difference between like and
watching friends and only watching
friends like Zoe what just friends lost
my job whilst editin was eating didn't
it makes me happy I just really like
friends I like Comedy Central friends
makes me really happy
basically Zoe watches friends for like
minimum 15 hours a day I don't actually
actively watching I know sometimes that
guys are all will I here as friends and
in between each they don't even care but
between just in case you do get between
each friends episode is the same adverts
every time and mcbusted one where they
get covered in paint and so I can
actually work I won't tell you all the
adverts the Comedy Central use now
anyways good god bad
god anyway anyway I changed the channel
mascot Lori Chuck Murphy has the choice
now to change the channel and I know I
know educational program I can't focus
on the TV right I know where were I wait
