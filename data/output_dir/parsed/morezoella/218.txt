good morning I did I'm putting my thumb
up good morning um look at this little
one she's like here's my toy three with
me and it's the noisy pink pig that
she's absolutely assessment that
crunches and it's really noisy
um alfie is away in front so I thought I
would just film today um it's me and
Nala
taking on the world and I've just
received my blooming wild box so I
thought I would open it with you guys
because I just loved it I'm like all
about these like subscription services
right now if any of you saw in Alfie's
block quite recently I subscribed to one
for Nala and which is probably the most
exciting one to be honest
when it's for someone at when it's your
PAP okay that's really noisy when it's
your pet kind of feels a little bit more
exciting because it's like oh what's in
there for you um but yes flowers also
very exciting I like flowers
I think flowers add something to a
household and in house without any
flowers and plants as a sad house what
can I say I'm sorry if you don't have
any parts of love in your house
hopefully um you're a happy person it
doesn't matter little bit oh come and
always come to this little card that
kind of explains what flowers bought
which I quite liked because growing up I
always watched my mum planting flowers
I'm following my mum around
in the garden center I never actually
knew what she was planting on you what
the flowers were called and so my
knowledge of flower names is pretty poor
I normally just go that one looks nice
and then that's how it works basically
anyway I'm going to put using a box and
I'm going to show you what they look
like
these are the flowers yeah very pretty I
really like them I'm not sure these are
a the only thing with blue and wild is
it has a little card that talks about
different types of flowers but it never
actually says what you've got in your
bunch so you just kind of go oh it looks
so pretty and I'll soon find out what
they will look like when they bought
them but yeah they look really nice so
far so I'm going to put these out
somewhere pretty so I've come into the
spare room just to give you a little
outfit debrief let me see hmm I'm using
the only long mirror that we have in the
entire house excuse all the washing
outfit I'm wearing this top from Miss
Selfridge which has a really cool back
so I've got a strapless bra on my
leather jacket from All Saints my new
Topshop trousers which are very 70s my
converse Oh
Anala um what else little earrings I
think these are from I want to say Urban
Arts which is our Topshop and my
lipstick is a Charlotte Tilbury um hot

called ash you have it

for quite a kind of Goldy beachy look
today and then I've got my tiny little
necklace on a lot of you wondered what
this said it has Brighton it's pretty
better if I show you it here there you
go

description box to what I can of this
outfit I'm just trying to think if I've
got anything else on Oh ring a sauce oh
that's what my earrings are from my
earrings are from ASOS just remembered
um and yes I am about to go shopping
with poppy she is going to get some
colour in her hair with the same guy I
had and so she's very excited and I
don't know how long my battery's going
to last because the battery is already
flashing on
this camera and when the battery flashes
on this camera it really is very dead so
I'm going to take my camera anyway but
it could possibly cut to quite later on
in the day myself
I'm perfect actually it's got similar
hairstyles eventually yeah oh yeah I got
rolled and we're just a blueberry many I
don't know I'm not she going thing that
what you going
okay
oh nice and help me
unlike a bit
I think there's something going on in
the music shop for people we were like
doing that I reckon it's actually copied
a quick being green
myself and poppy have just had a little
splurge in the space of hey everyone
because I've been watching a lot of
Caroline's videos I'm going to leave a
link to Caroline below I tweeted out her
videos the other day actually and she's
she's my mate and she knows everything
about skin and when you read her blog
and you watch her videos she just has
this thing about her that makes you want
to go out buy everything she's talked
about because you know you can trust her
opinion so I was actually like messaging
from the shop like do you think this
would be good for puffy I'm retired by
her blog post she actually been doing it
all wrong i'ma tell you yeah but it is
quite an eye opener actually when you do
read her blog it makes you realize how
precious your skin is and how much you
should be looking after it and how much
we probably don't as my food so yes and
I would like to put my sunglasses on
my head oh my god ow my head we're now
in pancakes
must be some time
ha do you want to party all the time
kind of right now it's so busy all right
pop yeah I love my new color I think it
looks lovely it's like a little skirt my
top now Hey
after all the top I don't have from the
top of it cause it's really it's some
day now I've been come down for brunch
chichi treacle and cola look at these
little very free peeking
get this behind the mirror oh yeah
they're cool little duck down there as
well
come hollering buzz
this case is look at the cake there was
a lot of choice I have to say
what are you before what you go push on
women I do and I mean children and
choose between like favorite any
questions breakfast has arrived
gimme gimme gimme oh my god oh my gosh
AM iam iam me we decide to put takes you
on
decision think I want a visa bread yeah
the carrot cake looks pretty good
hi guys so I was just editing the
footage that you have just watched and I
realized that it ended really abruptly
with just me being in a cafe buying cake
and me poppy and Sean deciding what
caked by and I was like mmm ah yes I
didn't roll after that um so apologies
for that
basically I just had a really lovely
time with Alfie's family whilst Alfie
was away snowboarding and it was just
really really nice and I would recommend
going to that place for breakfast
although I wouldn't say it was the best
breakfast I have ever had in Brighton
and the cake was okay I think if you're
a little bit more health-conscious you
will absolutely love that place but when
I buy a cake I want all the sugar and
all the butter in the cake not on the
cake um so I wasn't I wasn't completely
sold on the cakes but they were
beautifully handmade and I think that if
you love that sort of thing then that is
a place for you to go and buy cake I'm
rambling about cake now when really all
I wanted to do was to end this properly
so it wasn't just like yeah we're buying
cake and um the cake did not kill me
so yeah ah just thought I would say I
hope you enjoyed the video and I will
see you again very first soon
oh my goodness
