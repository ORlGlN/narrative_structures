hello so today in today's video I am
going to be chatting you through in
detail although not too much because I
don't want to bore you all to tears the
new products in the snow Ella zoella
Beauty Christmas range I have seen so
many of you already managing to get your
hands on this online at superdrug and in
store a super drug and online app feel
unique I love how many of you are in
love with the smell of this range which
makes me so happy because as I said in
my vlog where I kind of mentioned a
couple of the products and also in my
winter wonderland video this I think is
one of my favorite scents and I have
been wearing it non-stop so on the back
of the packaging it says snow Ella
captures the beauty of snowfall with a
flurry of stunning notes including
softening peony refreshing mint and pink
pepper let this festive fragrance take
you to your very own winter wonderland
where all is calm and all is bright so
those kind of beautiful combination of
scents come together to make the center
snow whether it's something that isn't
necessarily Christmassy although I
wanted to capture a very fresh kind of
snowfall scent I also wanted you to be
able to wear this through January and
February and March and April and like
all year round that is what I feel like
we did with this I absolutely love it I
also think this packaging is my favorite
Christmas packaging range ever worked
very very hard on this with the team and
so I'm dropping it everywhere but I
can't wait to show you everything in a
bit more detail every time I go on
Twitter this so many of you like please
tell me you're gonna make your sit down
zoella beauty snow Ella video soon so
yes I'm sorry here it is okay this is
kind of the star of the show
you guys this is where the product is at
basically I wanted something that had a
really high like inside value this is
currently 30 pounds it was 40 so get it
now because it's like a bargain for what
you get in it you get one two three four
five six seven eight nine products
inside you also get to keep this
I love the design its I kind of like
Scandinavian inspired and of course we
have some copper I'll show you
everything that comes in it this is a
really like sturdy box as well I'm gonna
use these
once I'm done to store things in okay
what you get inside is a full-sized snow
fresh body wash oh I feel like in every
single video I film nada has to jump in
it at some point so you get a full-sized
snow fresh body wash you get a
full-sized body lotion in snow silky you
get a full-sized snow scoop now you guys
know how much I rave about scooper dupa
which is the bubble bath in the classic
core collection we've done it in the new
scent and I just feel this is a must to
be honest I love it
huge you get so much in there you also
have a full sized winter wonder hand
hand cream you get a body butter some
snow smooth this is all quite tongue
twister it's no smooth not so smooth or
smooth smooth very good for knees and
elbows during the festive season you
also get two sachets of the bath milk
powder splash of milk this is probably
one of my favorite products we have ever
ever ever done I love it you get two of
those in there you also get a little
bath lily or shower lily whatever you
want to call them you also get a body
polish snow polish now this is a product
we have never done before and it's one
that has launched into the snow Ella
collection it is a body polish exfoliant
discover skin that glistens enriched
with softening peony brightening winter
cranberry and soothing mint
massage this foaming body polish into
wet skin until soft bubbles appear we've
done a foaming scrub it's like my
favorite thing ever so that also is in
there and that is everything you get in
that box for 30 pounds so the treasure
me box I feel is probably one of my
faves
because it gives you a bit of everything
so if you want to try this out
and you're a bath lover I would say that
is probably the thing you should aim to
get or I guess actually that would make
a very good present because it has like
a bit of everything in it but I am gonna
also show you everything else be all for
you
yay you guys love the tiny little mini
fragrances so we brought it back this
year and in it we have a tiny mini snow
Ella fragrance this is just adorable I'm
actually gonna spray this because I
haven't got any perfume on today mmm
love it so you get a tiny mini snow Ella
you also which I feel like those of you
who absolutely loved last year's
collection will really really like we
have a mini bake my day so if you ran
out of bake my day and you need your
like gingerbread Christmasy fix then I
feel like you'll be really happy with
that ah memories
oh my god I love that okay then you get
one of those and then you get the
classic blissful miserable fragrance and
you also get the certain that came up
this summer which is the gelato
fragrance so all in all some great what
dropped one but all in all some great
cute minis you also have something we've
never done before which is to make a
kind of special edition larger bottle of
the fragrance and it was all too
tempting as this Rangers called snow
Ella to have a giant furry pom-pom on it
so normally the fragrances are 45 mil we
have also popped this one into 100 ml
bottle it's glass it's lovely
I love the design it's just so freakin
cute and this is I guess this is like
you're sitting on the dressing table
looking ever so fancy with a little
white pom-pom bottle it's kind of cute
that it comes in so many sizes because
you've got look you've got the larger
one the original size and then you've
got the mini size this set is quite cool
and again it has something in it that
never done before so it's called I'm
dreaming of a bar filled with bubbles
and this is kind of more of like a gift
set and in it you get the bubble bar so
you get a cute little bottle of bubble
bath you get a snow silky body lotion
and you also get some exfoliating mix
which I think if you fake tan around
this time of year or if you get really
dry skin are pretty much essential for
this time of year I love getting my
experimenting mix out and now I actually
have some of my own which I'm very happy
about but also this which I'm a little
bit obsessed with this is the cutest
headband it's so soft and it's really
nice and stretchy and it has this really
adorable bow on it so this is for if
you're doing a face mask or if you want
to cleanse your face or remove your
makeup or you want to do your makeup and
have your hair out the way let me just
demonstrate for you I'm scared I'm gonna
get okay
oh oh I guess you could just wear it
it's so cute
I feel like I need to put my dressing
gown on and get in the bath like look at
me right now that is the I'm dreaming of
the bath filled with bubbles gift set
which i think is perfect for any bath
lover like myself so we do the mini
fragrances which a lot of you love and
they are some of the most popular
products across like any range than mini
bottles because I guess we all we're all
just a nation of people that love to
have things in miniature form which
doesn't surprise me really but one thing
I really really wanted to do this year
was roller balls because I am the sort
of person who likes to have a roller
ball in my handbag of my favorite scent
I just like it I don't know why I guess
not everyone is probably a rollerball
fan and it is quite like 90s but I am a
90's kid and I just think they're genius
handbags and for pencil cases and just
anywhere you want a tiny little like
perfume top up you have this which has
three fragrances in and this is called
we're on a roll because it's roller
balls get it get it so in it you have
thus no other fragrance you have the
blissful miscible fragrance and you have
the gelato fragrance
so it's a good mixture of three very
different scents so we have the snow
Ella fragrant set so this is like the
classic set that sort of comes out every
year where you have the fragrance in the
bottle this is a glass bottle and then
you have the body lotion to match it's
very much a kind of Christmas gift set
isn't it it's like your your typical
kind of Christmas gift here and also for
anyone that wants this size fragrance
like the normal size fragrance you can
only get it in this set this year we
have some cute little lip balms here we
go we have snow barmy and these are the
two lip balms which are in the shape of
stars this year we have star shaped tins
which I just think is the cutest thing
ever and they've got like these lovely
little snowflake pattern on them we have
snow soft which is a minty clear lip
balm which I just I just love middle of
them anyway so that's a favor of mine
and snow sparkle which is this really
lovely nude and it has like gold very
subtle gold shimmer in it and it's
really beautiful on the lips it's quite
subtle so you don't have to worry too
much about it being like that in a
really lovely vanilla scent so we have
those we also have the Sperry Sperry
night set this comes the little pot of
body butter and also the foaming
exfoliator the body polish called snow
polished so that's a really nice little
gift set if you want to get those things
without buying the huge big box you can
get them here I feel like it would be so
fun for me to stand in superdrug and
like demo the products on people after
their like shopping in superdrug it
could be like hey have you tried my snow
and a hand cream and then I could just
stand there and like give people like
little hand massages it's that wait I
have to say the body butter is a phase
of mine
we haven't done a body butter since I
feel like since we put one in the
drawers awesome drawsome which was good
mm v
have we done a body butter since then
winter wonder hand comes in this really
adorable little box so it's perfect for
gifting I actually feel like hand creams
are the perfect stocking filler I always
buy hand creams for people's stockings
or like as like a little extra gift the
hand cream is one of the best sellers
because so many of you guys love the
formulation and just keep repurchasing
and I don't blame you because this is
amazing I love it and now you can get it
with this cute packaging in this scent
so we have some snow relaxed bath fizzes
which come in this really awesome like
foil gold packaging and we've done
something we've never done before also
with these we really push the boat out
we have two giant snow ella bar fizzes
that look like this and they have this
really lovely let me just see if you can
see oh you can see they have this really
lovely snowflake on them and they are
full of like this really beautiful blue
iridescent glitter which looks a amazing
in the bath and be so pretty on your
skin when you get out so I am obsessed
at these I love them and it just smells
so fresh and then this which again is
one of my favorite things and also has a
product in it that we've never ever done
before which is the bath teabags I just
think these are an amazing idea I've
seen them in places like anthropology
but I've never seen them anywhere like
super drug so I was like I really want
to do a more affordable bath tea bag
because I love them it's it's it's got
like lovely properties in the tea bag
but makes the water just feel so lovely
and it makes your skin feel so lovely
and it's just a really interesting way
of having a bath that's not a bath bomb
or bubbles or you know I mean this this
offers you like an alternative bath
which I really really like they come in
these little boxes they're stuck
together but you can take them apart and
t-bags come in this bag inside I'm going
to show me one look it's the little bath
tea bag and it has a little Zidane it I
don't know if you can see that and you
literally just pop this in your bath or
hold it under the running water and you
get quite a few of those in there so
that's good you can get a lot of baths
out of these two things together and
then this is the splash of milk bath
milk I've talked about this before I
think this is one of my favourite
products that we've ever done just
because I love bath milk it's just such
an interesting bath and it makes my skin
feel like silk and I love it and you get
four sachets in this that's full baths
worth or if you want to you can double
up or you can have one of these and a
tea bag or a phizzer
like you can go crazy you can do quite a
lot of different things it's like a real
bath time cocktail within this
collection which I really really like
because this time of year for me is
mostly about bath time so I really
wanted a lot of bath time elements in
this collection and because it's such a
fresh scent it's kind of revitalizing
and relaxing and there's just so much
you can do at bath time with this range
which I really really like next talking
of bath time how cool is this this is
actually glass and it's beautiful it
reminds me of the like decanters that
like my mum and dad used to have with
like fancy alcohol in obviously this is
not alcohol this is like bath product
but you also get this really cute little
like pom-pom hair bubble around the top
which you can use if you want to get
very into the snow Ella festive vibes
this is the bubble bath you get four
hundred and ninety millilitres of it in
here which is amazing and this one
actually has like a slight shimmer to it
which i think is really lovely and it
smells lovely and it creates the best
bubbles but ultimately it just looks
freakin amazing on the side of your bath
and you can reuse the glass for whatever
you like afterwards this is fun
I like this this is a giant cracker this
is called your cracking but barbing
essentials Wi-Fi talk today bathing
essentials you can't actually pull this
cracker this is just packaging and it
looks really cute but also it's very
giftable like this is a great thing to
buy someone because it just looks so
it's more impressive in it you get a
100ml body lotion and 90 ml hand cream
and a 100 ml body wash
so these three things and the hand cream
is full-size as well but these are
perfect little like travel essentials
this is freaking cute this is actually
quite a few people's like favorite thing
whenever I let my friends and family
like raid my sample cupboard I have like
five of each thing and I always say to
people like help yourselves to whatever
you want literally everyone took one of
these so I don't have many of these left
I think these are probably the only two
I have left but this is the a winter
soiree you get this really adorable
little makeup bag or you can use it as a
pencil case or a handbag organization
bag it's completely up to you it's made
of this really nice like felt and it
says all is bright on the front then
inside it you get I have another one
which is unzipped inside it you get a
mini hand cream which is so cute when we
brought these out last year for the
gingerbread collection I was obsessed
with this this just lived on my desk
obviously I like the full size but you
know I like a mini so the mini one was
the one that came everywhere with me so
it's the winter wonder hand mini and
also the snow ella fragrance in a
rollerball rollerball has a very posh
then a rollerball which again would
probably live in this because I mean
this is essentially what you'd keep it
in and what you'd keep in it so it's
like an all-in-one really and then last
but by no means least we have no peaking
which is a Christmas stocking I don't
actually have one of these outside of
the box but you can see it in there it's
that same like felt material and it has
a fluffy bit at the top and it says no
peeking on it and
inside that you get a 100 mil body wash
so you get one this size and you also
get the body polish as well so you get
those three products inside and then you
also get a stocking as well and that is
everything there are so many products I
really hope you guys like it I've
absolutely loved seeing all your
instagrams and your tweets and little
bits and pieces you've already picked up
and you've said that you're loving so
thank you so so much
I'm gonna leave you now because I feel
like I've just talked at you for a
really long time and if I have to say
the word snow or fresh or body anymore I
think you're all going to scream so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
give it a thumbs up if you're excited
for this range or if you've already
tried it and you love it and I will see
you again very very soon bye
