elf why is this you stand next to it
someone's in my face go next it beyond
up that's you
elf Alfie come on nearly on the way home
no nearly home yes we're listening to
this again
I honestly think I've listened to this
how many times this is five just this
one today and you always saw is how free
that plate something's up her being too
fat you do still place on some I realize
I haven't shown you some other lights in
our garden is lipstick much everywhere
look I am obsessed with these we have
these like really tall thin trees and
we've put lights in all of them and
we've got lights around here and we've
also got lights around good incoming
you've just been to the toilet outside
here on all the little balls shrubs can
you see it's just so magical I love it
that's one of the things I've like
always wanted to do being homeowner it's
like go all out with Christmas lights
like exterior Christmas lights and now
we have and I'm very happy about it look
what I'm looking at right now a tree and
all the hedges outside that are covered
in lights it's just light everywhere I
love it and then the tree in the dining
room which I did say my vlog the other
day I would show you so I'm gonna show
you because I feel like this vlog is
gonna be very Christmas tree heavy this
is the dining room tree it's actually a
fake tree I am so not going fake trees I
think you can get some of the most
beautiful looking trees and they come
fully done with lights and look very
realistic like this one is from John
Lewis I will link it below if I can find
it because I do think it is one of the
best artificial trees I've ever bought
just because it's really
like full and like fluffy looking but is
the perfect shape and the perfect height
and the lights I think are placed really
well and you can choose like the setting
that you want so that saturate I've got
the disco balls underneath there and
then actually on the tree I have quite
an assortment of different baubles most
are John Lewis actually some I bought
last year these little ones are from
next but these like very delicate this
one is like one of my favorites as stars
and it's so pretty that's John Lewis oh
and I have these which actually used to
go on my family Christmas tree when I
lived at home with my parents and I sort
of stole them and now I have them so
there's some of those all over which I
kind of like because it's still the
dining room and we have these underneath
where's the other one of these John
Lewis so pretty
like super pretty I love those
these are next I sent one of these are
Joey and Daniel they have a little tree
inside but yeah I just I love this
Christmas tree I wasn't originally gonna
put a Christmas tree in the dining room
because I was like ah Christmas tree
overkill but the dining room is gonna be
one of the main rooms that we spend a
lot Christmas Day in and we have a log
burner in here and we're going to be
playing games and also like eating which
does consume most of Christmas Day you
have to admit so I thought it was only
right to per Christmas tree in here
because if it's Christmas Day and you're
spending most of your day in here and
you have space for it why not so the
dining room table is like this obviously
I will like decorate oh and then you
have a tree in the corner this is the
plant that was there I've just moved it
and then I've also got this on here
which my mom helped me decorate which I
really like it does have lights in it
actually but I need to replace the
batteries battery packs in there so yeah
I feel like this room
has kind of worked out to be one of my
favorite rooms and of course it will be
so much nicer when we can have the fire
going very exciting
taken off melissa is getting very messy
I come up to the top bathroom which is
the one up in my office because it's
5:00 time for this pooch
we don't really fast had that often but
she's been quite leaky recently so I
don't know whether she feels like she's
unseen so I'm gonna give her a little
bath and we don't normally wash her up
here we're not only trying to do it in
the kitchen sink or in the pantry sink
but it's quite small and I think it
stresses her out that it's quite a small
space you don't reuse this bar so we'll
see how it goes I'm not the biggest fan
of the bar
but sometimes it's gotta be done she's
going away now killer the puppy shampoo
I'm about to use is the mullen and go s
I'm probably butchering that a little
pug e on it
I've never used this one dog shampoo all
breeds oh it smells nice gotta keep
breathing follow evany nada
you've had this sermon boy come on
yeah it's fine right let's get your
towel
watch out that right then he's the
shower heads Oh
what no you know let me join you this is
my she always fights with that come here
come here let me show you just by
newzeas please good girl
just by noisy is okay you know it's
finally time to do the tree in the
living room thank heavens just getting
out all the decks from last year this
tree is going to be the white company
tree so these are all the decorations I
bought last year from the white company
and I just think they're very classic
timeless lovely little pieces I
especially love these they look really
effective in the tree and these are new
I've got these from John Lewis they're
like tiny little like lace tapestries do
you like these no no it's cute isn't
there oh that's cool yeah lots of lovely
depths first things first though the
lights I have to say this is my favorite
part of doing a tree just because I feel
like it's the bit that takes the longest
and requires the most precision if a
couple don't argue what's doing the
lights they don't stay together forever
we also have the holiday on
one thing we didn't really take into
consideration this year was that our
tree was like twice the size so the
lights have run out we haven't got
enough so they get to like there and
then this bushy bit the bottom has
nothing so I was like I'll don't worry
I've got more lights that match and then
we got the mountain and they didn't
match and these are all supposed to be
warm but there are like different tones
of warm so you've got like these ones
which are like the clusters like the
white company clusters and we've got
these which is really short and they're
very warm and then these ones which we
were going to on the tree with a very
greeny
we're trying to work out the best way to
make this work I think what we're going
to have to do is spread it out and then
add another layer of lights Oh anyway I
feel like we can just waste a whole
evening trying to do this again and
again I feel like it might literally be
worth taking an L today and loss and
buying Christmas tree lights that fit
that bigotry the children that were gone
since we get like warm lights they're
fit we need like 1,200 lights guess who
I gave my 1200 lights - yeah yeah yeah
he's bigger than my mom's it was for
hutch I gave them to her like two years
ago and then I never bought myself some
more it's either we have two sets of
lights which I'm happy to do obviously
input like intertwine with each other
and we just do what this week and today
I think it might look cute to do that if
I'm honest oh I think we go to a garden
center and get a big sets of that tree I
think we can intertwine and I think it
will look really nice yeah but they
don't have to be flashing they could be
still okay let's try to disperse these
more if we can and it looks good I don't
know
if we try to disperse the easiness look
in bit crap then we just have to go to
the gone Center tomorrow okay which is
something that we should just all about
bigotry I know some reason I just
thought this would be enough light doing
all right
whoa end yeah is right so we want to
bring this down
let me get loads down here we're gonna
yeah that's a lot there as well
I think leave the bit round the spine
we're just gonna add yeah that's it just
like completely drop them
lights a dime hi shiny times not
decorating you ready
and we're so nearly done look at it it
looks amazing I'm really happy with this
I think it looks so yeah is massive it's
huge and it has lots of little
Christmasy ornaments my favorite one is
the loved one is that yeah I think so
just because it always hangs lovely and
feels like the gaps like whenever you
see one it really like fills the gaps
like it right time to put the star on
you ready I am so ready I'm like leaning
into the tree is it on oh my gosh oh my
gosh all your weight is off got one
thing off on one then sorry is it which
way should we have it facing ah got it
that's as straight as it's gonna go oh
yeah yeah good
are you saying it's wonky it's so hard
to put straight I can't even tell you
know okay I am I'm really intrigued to
see how you make this straight because
it doesn't see it looks the same that's
right
it's straighter if you come down here
it's not exactly it's fine no it's not
gonna go like perfectly straight yeah
perfect
she says it's not gonna go perfect to
one huh yay it looks so good this is I
think this is my favorite tree we've
ever ever had just because that's like
so magical do you know what I mean it's
like so it's so huge and takes up like
such a big portion of what oh my god no
that has to be tomorrow we also need to
buy more lights for that tree because
it's not way we're doing two loads of
that Oh gorgeous what I think maybe
these lights are the ones that we would
normally use the ones I've put on the
stairs yeah that'll be it yeah anyway
I'm really happy with this now it's the
fun bit
who bring all the needles to fair that
sound is really satisfying
Nana feels so soft feel her so soft I
wonder what she thinks at the tree she
liked the tree do you like it
