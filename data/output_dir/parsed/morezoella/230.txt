good morning everybody today I am
wearing dungarees for the first time in
15 years I want to say something like
that ridiculous anyway Joe is coming
back because we were supposed to film a
video when he was here last time but the
preparation for this video is taking a
really long time and we just weren't
really in the filming mood so I'm now
kind of sat here sorting this out I'm
basically going through a lots of old
home footage and I don't know if any of
you saw the video that we did at
Christmas in 2013 I think it was where
excuse the mess um where we look back
through old Christmas videos basically
we are going to be doing the same thing
but just non Christmas videos because
obviously Christmas restricts it to one
time of the year we have a lot of old
home footage like a lot a lot and some
of it is absolutely hilarious I love
watching it and I'm so glad my parents
filmed when we were younger because
whenever I watch things at saucony
Jolie's and other family vloggers it's
so cool to think that when they grow up
they have all this footage that they can
watch back they can see like Emilio
Eduardo can see what their parents are
doing before they were born they can see
their birth they can see everything
obviously my parents didn't film to that
extent but they still have things like
doing what our first bit of walking at
the moment I'm watching this which is me
when I was one I think or just under one
just turned one and I'm playing with a
hat the fun things um I just think it's
funny how I walk
a little dress with a color but it's
just really interesting to watch this
stuff like I love it I love that we have
this um Oh F Hawk got told off there
look at my little chubby cankles anyway
I don't want to give too much away but I
am essentially going through a mountain
of DVDs and old tapes and trying to find
the footage that Majo can then watch
through and kind of like react to - so
yeah this is probably what I'll be doing
all day but I'll film anyway and keep
you guys in the loop hello sweet pea
hello comin let's go downstairs
Joanne alia nearly here yeah I love how
she waits she's so cute so Adi is also
coming which is really nice because I
was saying to Joni other day that I
don't really get to hang out with Ollie
very much Joan you get to kind of watch
him enjoy his videos so I'm very excited
you've never met me before got a new
person coming to see you and he's just
text me saying we're nearly a Brighton
so I'm most excited I'm so very tired
today um last night I had the most crazy
nightmares I dreamt that I was asleep I
don't know if this is a thing so I let
you out you might need a wheelie come
here then good girl I dreamt that I was
sleep and that Alfie was here and that
someone was breaking in downstairs and I
was trying to wake Alfie up in my sleep
I couldn't and I was trying to scream at
him and I couldn't and then I was
looking at him whilst I was half asleep
while he was asleep it was the weirdest
thing and every time
look to him that was like a ghost or a
zombie or something terrifying next to
him so I was trying to scream as loud as
I could at him I was like I like
screaming at him but nothing was coming
out so I can only imagine I actually
probably could have been possibly
screaming in my sleep last night but it
would have not sounded like screaming I
don't know what it would have sounded
like but I think maybe that's why I feel
so tired I just didn't sleep properly I
just was in that kind of state way you
just dream a lot and then I like woke up
and I was like texting Alfie who's in
Atlanta so his time is five hours behind
me so I woke up like oh my god I've just
had the worst dream ever I dreamt that
there was someone in the house and I'm
here on my own and that's not a nice
dream Taff um but then he texts me back
and he was like okay and then I felt
like to sleep but I just don't think I
slept deeply enough put it well you've
got your favorite toy crunchy toys are

Kaspar this is what happens when you go

like this one
oh I love nothing ever freakin focuses
this has got like different types of
biscuits and not a lot of those call
that the pink wafers one of those things
and a custard creme now I have to try
