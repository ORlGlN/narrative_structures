I'm blamed there yeah good morning
everybody
I've been downstairs I've had my
breakfast I said the dog just gone
through lots lots of work stuff I'd kind
of put it all off yesterday and I didn't
look at any of my emails because when
you're away for ten days there's a lot
of people that need answers so I woke up
at 20 past 6:00 this morning and went
downstairs and basically started sorting
out my life I'm trying to get past the
like post holiday holiday so I've been
doing that this morning I am now going
to jump in the bath because I have been
doing all that with no bra no makeup
haven't brushed my hair and I figured I
needed a little bit of a spruce up so
I'm having a bath which I haven't had in
ten days and let me tell you I have
missed bath time
look I've already run out of one of my
bath lattes but I don't I can't like bed
throw the bottle away because I just
love it so much um so I don't really
know what to do with that maybe I'll
just make a little collection of like
empty bath latte bottles but yeah I'm on
to the second one might have to use a
bit of this this is for blonde hair it's
a purple shampoo so it kind of I don't
know brings the blonde back I mean I
basically just Hamre been taking the
best care of my dyed hair because it's
been in like extreme Sun and it's also
been in the sea I might do a little hair
mask maybe or use that shampoo I'm also
going to put a bath balm in and I
figured that you all like seeing which
bath bomb I've chosen so I might go for
this one
I don't know what this one is is
definitely a lush one let's see oh it's
one of those like slow fizzes okay well
that was really anticlimactic wasn't it
I'll let you know if it looks any
different smells good though I also have
two massive bags of PA box stuff which I
need to go through
ooh let's see new peak o6 oh my god I
love this brand yes - Tomatoes blemish
clearing facial wipes don't really use
wipes but these are pretty good you know
always good for an emergency anyway I
need to stop I'm getting carried away
all there's loads of things in there oh
my goodness this is just too exciting
what's that the book oh my god it's
bigger than I thought it was gonna be
Lonely Planet ultimate travels the 500
best place on the planet ranked damn I
like bloody travel anxiety oh I love
getting things like that just because
it's like I really want to be able to
travel I could travel a probe oh so hard
for me and actually after the holiday I
just had which wasn't all plain sailing
it may look it may have looked joyous on
Instagram but there were definitely
moments where I found it quite difficult
um so I love getting things like this
because it just reminds me that I suck
at traveling it doesn't mean I don't
want to hey Nana oh it just means I suck
at it but I'm not always going to suck
at it that's what I told myself one day
I'm going to be ultimate traveller goals
and I'm going to make that flight to
Australia that literally seems like the
scariest thing in the world but one day
I'm going to do it a bath bomb update
still looks like that
- fresh out the tub oh let's put you
here it's actually quite warm today so I
wanted to kind of keep the summery theme
up as obviously I'm really in the mood
to wear holiday type outfits but now I'm
going to blow dry my hair style it and
do a little bit of makeup while I was
away my skin really cleared up and now
I've come back it's gone quite sporty
again so
goodness knows what's going on there
you
you
okay my hair is done that takes so long
I might have short hair but it doesn't
mean that there's not a lot of it
things like curling my hair styling my
hair always takes a really long time I
feel so much like I have that really
like gross like bit of sweat on my top
lip it's very hot in here very very hot
okay now on to makeup
I feel like today my tan has gone I
don't know where it went but it just
feels less there or they might eat it
very white well the hell is that all
about
ting maybe I do still have a tan my job
can't see anymore I feel so much more
fresh now that's so much better
um that was hello no this is like sign a
little hallway I haven't been able to
come my hair in Mykonos because I don't
know whether my colors just didn't
really get hot enough or um oh my god I
can feel the change in my air and I walk
down a lot fees ringing me because I
look like one Oh
