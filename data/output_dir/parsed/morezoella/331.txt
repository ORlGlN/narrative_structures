thing where I bought something from the
cashier and she said have a safe flight

really silly saying I'm sorry you're not
going on a flight and then I felt like a
bitch

five minutes of painting so which is a
bit ridiculous so out bruh because I'd

mirror but it also comes out to another
mirror and you can see into the room is
the Bossip it's blurred funny hello

like how it doesn't cut all the way to
the bottom but in a way it reminds me of
like the saloon doors and then the
bathroom doing a bathroom tour got some
rotary gal a nice bar shower is LP and
then you have like a sliding door into
and day a bday and another little mirror
