it's the 14th of December we are about
to go shopping when I say we I mean me
Joe and Alfie we're gonna go into a bit
of Christmas shopping while stores new
and make up this morning I was watching
my queen Tyler Oakley's new video with
Connor Franta and I have been laughing
my head off
and I'm only halfway through if you've
not seen this video yet please go watch
it so funny and it also makes me miss
you Tyler I really missed you
whilst I was in Dubai a viewer who met
me in the hotel lobby gave me a present
and one of the presents in the box was a
Mariah Carey Carey Mariah Carey
Christmas album so I think it's only
right that on the way into town today
this is what the three of us will be
listening to although Joe and Alfie
don't actually know that yet two songs
in and the voice made me change Mariah
Carey to Michael Buble
I don't mind cuz I like we please well
it's beginning to look a lot like
Christmas
so uh scum
what Oh
right
Oh
do you all this is too big for me to
even function they're way too busy in
here without food
three men do but we gonna come by
furious
Oh having a real good look now he's
fighting is now anticipation oh you just
have a little look over we are done
shopping and oh my goodness that was
stressful yep
this is all I got okay if you're like me
and you don't like crowds of people in
small tight spaces then yes it's
stressful
this is why I like to do all my
Christmas shopping online I did however
manage to get quite a lot of presents
and an a ton of papers on your space but
I'm gonna have to go because there's a
lady that wants my space by these are my
favorite cookies they're from Marks and
Spencer and I'm just eating one in the
car
while singing mr. Hankey the Christmas
poo in my head can you hold my cookie
for me please thanks just going to go
down again I also bought this which is a
Christmas tradition in our household
it's the Radio Times we like to buy this
and we flick through it and since we
were children we would always highlight
the things we want to see when it's
Christmas there's a lot of good things
on the television
so as Christmas tradition goes the Radio
Times is going to be filled with lots of
highlighted films that we are all going
to sit down and watch as a family what
ones are they give me it's for look why
don't you have a look okay that's it
hear it smell good it's my first night
like Christmas does it smell like
Christmas
I'm currently exporting yesterday's vlog
so I can get that up to you guys and the
cooking in my camera is driving me crazy
I don't know but it could have been
apart from the fact that when I was in
Harrods
I dropped it with the lens open like
straight on the floor and at the time I
was like aw whew it's not cracked it's
not smashed but I think something
happened to the inside of it which then
means it's sorry I've got Harry Potter
on and it's very loud I do love Harry
Potter so I think maybe it broke when I
did that because I'm I'm pretty sure it
wasn't clicking when I first started
vlogmas if any of you can go back and
find the first day where it started
clicking that would be a massive help
because I think if it's after the
Harrods Day with Steve and Alfie then it
could possibly be that which I don't
think we can get fixed and I don't have
warranty on this I don't think and I
don't have insurance on it so I'm gonna
have to buy a new camera I've been
through so many digital cameras this
year it's actually unreal I can still
keep the one I'm using because it's
still very very good for taking pictures
and I actually love taking pictures with
this camera it's got Canon s1 110 if
anyone's interested no s1 10 if anyone's
interested but I think for filming I'm
gonna have to get another one because
the clicking is driving me hard and I'm
really sorry guys if it's driving you
mad as well I'm going to watch the more
Harry Potter now and
load my blog also want to show you
quickly because I think this is really
cool myself personally company magazine
look who's on the front
yeah there's me and Thailand Carrie and
Alfie and Emma and Ruth and Patricia and
Tom and we're all on the front of
company magazine and then inside I've
got a page too we've all got like a page
each I hate that they put me next to
Ruth Ruth is a model damn you Ruth you
know how to pose the whole time I was
thinking as long as they don't put
minutes truth in that's good because I
don't know what I'm doing and Ruth is a
professional model so there's my page
how cool is that
companies actually my favorite magazine
and so to be featured in that and on the
front cover is insane honestly madness
it's now later on and I've watched um
Harry Potter and I've uploaded my vlog
and now look I'm talking to on skies I
tweeting yay technology is my cherry
I've missed you so much to me I missed
you more
don't go to buy again or anywhere I'm
not allowed to leave my house ever again

no I'm not showing them the presents but
I got her this stocking from Kath
Kidston and it's just a cute little
Merry Christmas one and this is all the
wrapping paper I've got one of these
sellotape things cuz I think these are a
lifesaver when it comes to wrapping lots
of presents and I also have lots of
different things to wrap the presents up
because I get far too interrupting
presents these are the two that I want
to use mostly just plain brown paper and
this brown one with just white on it and
then I'm going to pop them all back

that I have done so far for Louise's
presents I'm just gonna pop them all
