here in that just like bumping around
Amsterdam so I could go car yeah I say
we head down this way we're looking for
a little place to stop and grab some
food and a drink that girl rude isn't
there we don't know what this is the
equivalent of like the Amsterdam version
of a supermarket or something but we're
gonna go in it is so cold and I'm gonna
get hit by a bike it's gonna happen oh
wow this is so cool
now we are I'm not too sure where we're
going a wonder but it looks so lovely
let me show you
look at the sky
we found like the main street I got what
and we went into a lush shop because
we've got a bath in our hotel room and
because I'm so cold
the thought of going back now and like
getting in a bar is very appealing we're
trying to find our way back to the nine
we're not in nine streets now are we
were in like the main street conquer sir
yes Alfie thinks he knows where our
hotel room is but his sense of direction
is actually shocking no my actually
unbelievable no it's not it's always
impeccable you don't feel bro do you I'm
not telling you I will get us there you
watch okay not doubting you you're I'm
just doubting you a little bit my lips
are so cold I can't feel myself moving
them which one's guys look at this huge
boat how cool is that it's like a proper
house and then this one is also massive
Alfie's just googling where our hotel is
you were googling where it was yeah
right the cold was starting to get to me
so I just bought a bobble hat can you
hold this while I put it on
it's a nice tight fit perfect love it
we're back in our hotel room now and I
just wanted to show you some of the bits
we picked up in the supermarket so I got
this mainly because it was so cute
it's called passion mama bio lemonade
I'm assuming it's passion fruit is
maracuja maracuja and orange there maybe
that's passion fruit and then it got a
bit wet because one of our juices leaked
in the bag but I also picked up some
Toni's chocolate we don't have this do
we in the UK and they had so many
different flavors and it's all in Dutch
so I was trying to guess what the
flavors were like obviously I can tell
what pretzel toffee was so I got one of
those I also got honeycomb which Alfie
won't like but I will like because I
love honeycomb so I'm gonna try these
yeah so I'm gonna try these and see what
I think and also try my really cute
little drink and then we also got the
two bath bombs from lush some carrots
and hummus and pita and hummus and then
this speculaas is basically it's
speculoos biscuits which I did not
realize were traditionally dutch so yeah
very excited to eat those they're like
pisco sour but like the original
business ah yeah destroy them oh my gosh
there's a lot yeah I need to order a cup
of tea we're in bed Alfie's just poured
like the biggest glass of champagne
Cheers
I don't I can't drink the whole bottle
to myself did I get actually don't want
mind eh this is quite a nice one what
what is this
it's great free are you gonna drink oh
I'm gonna get wasted I would if I just
do that hmm
let's do it yeah just drink yeah in the
five years we've been together I've
never been drunk around you maybe tipsy
yeah yeah when we used to go out drink
did I know I enjoyed oh yeah more so I
am gonna give Tony's a massive thumbs up
or what you call a man with no chin chin
would you call it a joke when you can't
member in your boy just to finish yet
even though you're telling him the joke
oh fail one√≠s is great and Alfie's even
enjoying the honeycomb won and he did
honey go
we've got Tony's champagne mmm
we are livers alive also guys when we
were in the airport
I recently how did I remember this
actually I can't remember why I thought
it I was like what was my first like
grown-up scent when I was a teenager and
the answer is Gucci rush - that was my
first proper perfume I don't remember
beautiful Gucci bought it for me so I
think someone bought it for me in a set
with a body lotion no it wasn't a
boyfriend and that smell for me is like
my teen years proper brings back a lot
of memories and a current month remember
why but me and Alfie were talking about
it and I was like I need to order that
like I want to smell it again so I was
like looking on a few websites but I
never got around to ordering it and then
when we were in the airport earlier they
had it so it's this Gucci rush then it
has a two on it very important if not
Gucci rush is Gucci rush - honestly like
this this is nostalgia in a bottle Alfie
actually bought this for me as my
Valentine's present say Thank You Alfie
I know don't you run out use it yeah
yeah he did tell me I wasn't allowed to
use it but it was too tempting I
love it so much ah but I would
absolutely love to know what your first
like childhood or teen property was I
had body range I had a lot of like
impulse body sprays and actually the
body sprays I did use were the boots
ones did anyone else use those they were
like they were watery they were like
water booth all your girlfriends I was
like your first care
no you were not my first gear I was your
my 83rd guess I'm joking but yeah let me
know what your first kind of grown-up
perfume was when you were like a team
that was Gucci jump is mine oh my god my
boy for my ex-boyfriends this cheap jump
the green one Oh Gavin off cool water oh
he had that as well
it's so predictable isn't it and then I
had another boyfriend who used to wear
Armani code what they my friend Ned use
well - not so good boy had Paco Rabanne
1 million every single boy like you
could just tell when someone was wearing
that this isn't it funny like the most
popular ones I feel like there's
definitely a lot more choice now in
terms of fragrance but do you like the
smell of this I really do I do that does
smell quite Zoey doesn't know if some I
wonder what the notes are fresh and
floral and fruity it's nice I'm gonna
smell like my 15 year old self
good morning everybody welcome to day
two in Amsterdam it is a beautiful sunny
morning this morning and I'm so excited
to get out and explore here's my outfit
today I've got this jumper on from Joni
that says Sincerely Yours I've got my a
soft spot a denim top and some pink
trousers from a source and then my
converse and how he's leaving without me
pick up beautiful this Taurus look at
there we're going to go for pancakes
this morning our way if we can get out
it's actually pancake day today which to
be honest I think oh you might did you
bring any old ugly instead of having
breakfast in the hotel we thought we
would go out and have pancakes for
breakfast but first we have to make a
detour to a shot south it really wants
to go in that has lots of watches in it
that's so cool I would love to live on
one of those that's so sick right Mike
isn't even there
we're so nearly there I've got a lot of
layers on so doesn't look like I should
be cold but my god my face in ears I
need a hat I did bring one in Alfie's
bag I think I might have to wear after
we've had pancakes
thanks a cooling
on the package are you hungry I am good
pancakes have arrived I've gone for
chocolate sauce banana strawberries and
blackberries and cinnamon what was on
yours again banana walnuts honey dates
maybe yeah I'm coconut yeah we've come
to this museum the Marco do you see the
Banksy exhibition who has that we got of
bloody lost him hello hello let's go
Rockman welcome in
look at this Chanel store it looks
amazing
should we go in yeah I think the only
time I've ever been in the Chanel shop
was when we went to Paris in 2013 I've
never been since they're not gonna be
allowed to film in there oh no camera
goes away now I'm not sure how this
happened
I'll be so let's just go and have a look
and now we're just sat in one like
testing all the bit
snitch Egon ice cream on the side as
well
yeah this is so delicious it's a BLT
with avocado and an egg so good what did
you go for cucumber and tomato we've
been eating the tomatoes this is where
we just a corner bakery oh I need one of
those Brisas you know wait wait wait
wait wait wait we've come to a place
called PJ's which is meant to do the
most amazing donuts it looks good okay
there's nothing like walking into your
hotel room to a fully made bed I love it
these are the doughnuts that we went for
in the end so we've got white chocolate
and raspberry this is just a plain one
wasn't Alfie just like a glazed yeah
lemon meringue and a creme brulee oh my
God look how good they are there for
later on tonight I am stuffed right now
because I am so cold I've decided to run
myself a bath now he's having a bit of
like iPad time I pad time I did it
Wiltshire accent are you tired we'll go
as soon as I've dipped in the bath and
defrosted and put on some warmer place
just you in the bath okay yeah why don't
you do that you can watch pop we didn't
know what shop this morning because they
had they must have just been opening for
them yeah and there was no watches in
the window
now the math design yeah so what you
want to go to the watch shop while I'm
in the bar yeah take the key I've had my
bath I've put a little bit more makeup
on I've put some more layers on and I
think I've just about worked out how
cold Amsterdam is in day two so one
thing I did book when I planned this
trip for myself and Alfie was to go to
the Anne Frank museum which is
essentially the house in which Anne and
her family hid and lived so I've booked
just tickets to go and do that which is
where we're gonna go now I'm really
excited to see it because Anne Frank's
diary was one of the first like proper
books I've ever read so I must have been
about eight or nine and I'd read like
children's books up to that point but
actually Anne Frank's diary although
written by a child is quite like wordy
and that was like how I remember my
first like big book that I'd ever read
and I remember it like really
fascinating me and it being really like
heartbreaking and I remember one night
when I was sat on the stairs and my
parents are like clearing up after
dinner I was reading out loud to them
because I was like you've got to listen
to this this is crazy can you believe
this little girl is living in in this
and like I can't believe this really
happened and it just completely blew my
mind
and I just find it all very interesting
so I'm excited to go and see it be
excited the exact place the exact place
that she wrote her diary it's mad I just
because I haven't read her book I've
read the diary I am I've always pictured
her being like early twenties 13 to 15
yeah she was a teenager yeah I'll tell
you about it when we get out you ready I
think we're done we don't have to go
just now but we're gonna have a little
mooch around the shops yeah we're gonna
head that way cool let's go look how
pretty
this is the queue for Anne Frank but
this is the session before us so we're a
little bit early don't you step too far
that way oh my god stop so we think this
is our Frank's house because there's
people having pictures outside it maybe
that was her front door do you think I
don't actually remember so we're just
walking back from the Anne Frank museum
Alfie what do you think I thought it was
amazing it was 20 times better than what
I thought it could be
yeah not bad they've done really well
like the layout is amazing they've not
changed too much so you actually feel
like you're kind of experiencing history
which I think it's probably quite hard
to do when you have to preserve so much
but and when there's so many people
going in and out but yeah that's busy a
lot of people it was amazing like really
amazing I said to alfie that was one of
the things when I'd read that book when
I was younger I think I've probably read
it like four times it's the only book I
think I've read more than once really
yep when I was little I was like I have
to do that at some point in my life and
now I've done it but yeah this is very
if you're ever in Amsterdam and you've
read Anne Frank's diary or you're
interested in it I would definitely
recommend going and having a little look
around
and there's an audio guide as right what
you didn't know before so that made it a
lot easier to understand and like feel
like you were immersed in the history of
it it was great great but sad it's like
you can't really be like oh it was
amazing because obviously it's a very
sad like reason but look a hallway Alfie
now you think I'm
that's delivery because we have seen a
few delivery vans so I think what we're
gonna do for tonight because it is
literally freezing cold is to try and
order something on delivery but I did
say to Alf it's probably going to all be
in Dutch so what a copy about Google
Translate oh it's very dark in here oh
yeah you still got Jim left are you
gonna have some gin what's in that I
haven't looked in that jeez and these
these are very Dutch troop shoe pockets
we need to eat some of these but first
I've got a little like I didn't see it
it was dark
Johnny something don't you Bravo yeah
good morning everybody
it's day 3 in Amsterdam and it's
Valentine's Day I've just given Alphaeus
card do you like it oh you have you
gotta open it later
Oh this morning's plan is that Alfie is
going to meet a guy about a tattoo cash
real cash know a guy who does tattoos
obviously he has Alfie has wanted a
tattoo for quite a while and when he
arrived here he was like oh my god why
don't I see if there's any sick tattoo
artists in Amsterdam who can give me a
tattoo I was like yeah go for it now
we've got an appointment to go and meet
the guy and he's gonna Dyke I think
maybe draw it on stencil and see what
you think of it and then he'll make a
decision about if he actually wants to
get the tattoo or not but you're pulling
it a little bit I'm not worried about
the pain or anything well going up we're
obviously getting tattoos for the pain
I'm scared tattoos can heal me forever
like damn but I'm not going anything
bigoted or I'm just doing something
super small very subtle right
dragging on my face you know I'll just
be imagine in Amsterdam when in
Amsterdam why not don't give a damn in
Amsterdam and then we'll see if I like
it or not yeah there's no pressure no
and he's like super chill but we aren't
gonna be late if you don't hurry up it's
another beautiful sunny day when we
first got here it said it was gonna be
sunny Monday and Tuesday bit of rain on
Wednesday and then sunny again on
Thursday but lo and behold is actually
sunny again today so I'm very worried
about that yeah do you like it yeah let
me show you them the front I'm bananas
about you I love it
that's why if you ever got me one it's
like a gorgeous
I don't mind I'll just have a little bit
of influence over what tattoo you get to
make up for it oh let's just go in steps
one on each other and you see what I'm
not I'm not gonna tell me your name I'm
gonna tell him that I'm not that
spontaneous yeah we all know you are
we're just we're gonna die
anyway walking there now Alfie seems to
think he knows where he's going the
streets easy here is crumpled at New
York like it's all that more or less
very very good stuff yeah I like this
time of the day there's like no one
around
are you never know because I might not
get it
yeah in yourself yeah I think it is the
unexpected what this is
tiny little I got a tattoo funny did you
think that that would happen when you
getting there are we gonna get a Jew so
should go somewhere else no we're gonna
go to yeah I didn't think that was gonna
happen no I wanted it to happen
I don't think about it did you I knew
you were gonna I just knew because you
you know you want one sort of mystic we
like what are you waiting for you know I
mean yeah I would I just love how
easygoing he was and so on he was like
think about things like depending where
you get it obviously your skin mood so I
will get my arm seized I make sure you
know what it looks like when you do this
or that
yeah you it's great so we've come to
somewhere called pluck for some kind of
breakfast lunch it's good you've just
gone for a normal oh it's a sorry I
think
cake and then look at mine it's a
uniform so we're walking across this
square and there's like a thousand
pigeons mark this is your absolute
nightmare we need to get through there
which way you go if you were here you
would be lying on the floor with your
hands over your face
they are everywhere look at them it's
like Mary Poppins feed the bird no don't
whoa baby I don't need you or me
basically a fee needs a coke absolutely
freezing she's coming into hmm we've
come into Primark so I can get some new
gloves cause either like waging big it's
making my hand so cold and it is the
biggest Primark I have ever seen in my
life
how many fools do you think has like
five no that's six or seven I so wish we
had room for me to do like we do I've
got half my suit you know you've seen my
pasture there's no way we get no no come
into a McDonald's and we are ordering on
a giant iPad experiencing Amsterdam the
best way we know how
we found a bird bar for a Monday for a
birthday I think it would look so cute
in our garden mostly just because of
everyone else's reactions that was the
strangest experience so much for sex me
in graphic I mean as a sex museum I just
wasn't expecting that at all like at all
if you wanted to read up about stuff no
one was like reading stuff everyone was
just sitting there like I went in
expecting to learn something would you
recommend that something to do if you're
in Amsterdam if you want a picture with
the giant it wasn't expensive to go in
oh it's five euros each okay so I feel
like it was it was a good experience
glad I did it I didn't learn anything
can't get any instagrams in there kind
of just experiencing obviously a lot of
people watch these videos so everyone in
there is just means OE looking at some
penises yeah boobs after working all day
what felt like all day it's nice to come
back and we've got a takeaway pizza in
bed we've just had it delivered looks so
good and then we also ordered some like
room service bits
I got myself a mint tea Alfie got a
glass of red wine is the perfect
Valentine's night in red wine pizza
you're naked I'm not no am i clearly I'm
gonna put a film on and just chill very
like what is that what do you say I
didn't press record quick enough good
morning everybody welcome to our last
day you know we still have a couple of
hours so we're gonna go and wander
around we actually went out this morning
and had breakfast with mother pucker so
if any of you know that's Anna and also
her husband Matt and their little cute
baby called Stevie Evie Evie Stevie she
is so cute
me and Alfie actually listen to their
podcast I would recommend you listen to
it if you don't it's great it's so funny
also follow her on Instagram I leave a
little link in the
option because she has some of the best
Instagram stories they crack me up but
they are staying in the same hotel as us
so we were like oh let's meet and have
breakfast which is what we did this
morning I left my camera here on charge
but I think she may have posted a
picture but the three of us having
breakfast which is nice I'm gonna go
find that we've packed up our suitcases
as always
Alfie's washbag have snuck its way into
my suitcase this happens every time
never on the way out but always on the
way back
yes but Jory tell you why because you
bought hairspray and it didn't fit no
because and I mean we do have our own
suitcases so we have to fit to our own
sizes but if you bring enough clothes
for four days and I do my actual items
good this job is already done with the
material thank you
so explain this your theory is fine I
get it yeah but you managed to bring
your wash bag on the way here so how can
you top bring it on the way back so I've
got so much of your stuff in my bag
anyway there's no your I get your theory
but that doesn't work well no that
doesn't take up much room it's gonna
grab my handbag yeah we're just gonna
have a little mooch around go in a few
more shops and then our flight is at
7:00 p.m. so we've paid to keep the room
for a bit longer putting on my
seven-year-old gloves I got up and
washed my hair this morning and the
Amsterdam water makes my hair feels so
silky I love it
yeah coming have you got keys got the
keys name that reference okay I'm coming
I feel like I don't have anything oh
look at you standing in our doorway I'm
gonna miss our little house I'm coming
you should take an umbrella go just no
yes do we take an umbrella or not who's
gonna carry it I don't we're gonna get
that I was rubbing it wet enough to
carry
that literally defeats the whole point
of an umbrella okay number neck all that
on a decision and whether or not we need
to take an umbrella you've got the key
get the keys
awesome dude come back into the little
shop we came into you before because I
need to stock up on this chocolate which
is the one we had before it was the
honeycomb this one yeah there's loads of
others if you want to get some other
ones yeah you could grab some school and
well so good so we are now just making
the most of this last little time left
all the sun's trying to come out and
we're just walking along
and popping in and out little sharp like
a bit of a nosey bit of a meander where
you going shopping look at all the
tulips and things we should get your mum
and dad some clumps isn't it that's just
a bomb again yes let's do that
I think the white ones are only 313 days
to Christmas yeah 313 days it says
inside as well
there I am I'm ready for Christmas there
you are
Hey look we've got a little pitch with
us I think I've got a bit too close for
comfort
these cheese's we should go my dad's
it's a cheese roll so this is the Tonys
damage we did we got meringue we got
where it says wit fram boosts which i
think is berries or like raspberry or
strawberry caramel and sea salt
honeycomb got two of those because they
are incredible and then a white
chocolate mmm the moment of truth does
the shoot cake
shoot kay sure there's a short case shut
yeah it does
did you have fun
overall mm-hmm way more than what I
thought oh by the way look at my jumper
I think it's so cool I bought this in
Margate I don't remember what the brand
is but I can fly home look buy sisters
Willie
thing sunny day lazy old fish back at
the car time to put the luggage all
right oh my god
oh yeah forgot I'll feed filled the
booth with all the stuff that you had
taken to Dave's ting to Dave's house I
think they're heading to Shawn's
because that's where I'm under nikhat
and they have Nala
let's hope Alfie kept our keys safe to
drive the car home you don't need them
do you not ever bought me some more
cheeses from the vending machine no
until we're back did you enjoy that trip
that was one of our favorite trips we've
ever been on yeah why I think it's
because we were both together it wasn't
work what I did and we both didn't work
yeah we actually didn't work the amount
of emails and stuff I've got to catch up
with tomorrow yeah I am like doing
myself a little bit how much I need to
do because taking four days out it makes
you realise how how many little things
you do every day yeah but I had so much
fun I'm glad we went away for
Valentine's and I loved Amsterdam it was
lovely I want to go back so bad we want
to go back in like this spring summer so
we can like actually rent bikes and use
pedalos and go and see the tulips
because it was way too cold to like do
anything that wasn't dipping in and out
of warm shops basically yeah we had lots
of yummy food

out but yeah we're gonna go and get
unknown the background I'm so excited to
