good morning guys I am about to do my
makeup and I thought I would let you
watch all
but this today is officially the first
day of spring which makes me so happy I
actually love spring I was having this
conversation with Louie the other day
whose favorite like season is autumn I
was saying how maybe actually it's
spring because it's not too hot but the
sun's out and everything just seems so
much more fresh and everyone's moods are
lifted and everything just looks so much
better in the sunshine doesn't it and
actually I was speaking to Joe my
brother um and because he's just got
back from LA and he was saying how
waking up every day in LA is just so
good like for like your mood like it's
just the Sun like the Sun just makes
everyone so happy here are our resident
pigeons that Nala does not like she will
probably start barking soon or are you
not barking because I'm watching you
maybe she's just getting used to them
but we need some names for these pigeons
guys I'm gonna say one's a girl and
one's a boy even though I don't know
that and how do you even like tell the
sex of a bird but yeah they are they
come here every day and basically eat
the grass seed so I'll never get grass
and the lawn will always be patchy
because of mrs. pigeon and mr. pigeon
are you tired
I think you're tired shake it off look
at these that we bought from the corner
shop salted caramel crunch coveri
fingers now I like Cadbury's fingers as
a standard kind of snack when you add
salted caramel into the mix that's just
two of my favourite things to be honest
I was feeling in a smoothie mood so I've
decided to make myself a smoothie and
normally I will just use like frozen
fruit and throw it all in the blender
with some like apple juice or orange
juice but today I wanted to make
something a bit different like something
a bit more like thick so I have
raspberries strawberries a banana some
oats some agave nectar
some Greek style natural yogurt and I'm
just going to kind of throw it all in
and kind of guess but I have seen quite
a lot of recipes using porridge oats and
natural yogurt and and instead of honey
I wanted to use the agave nectar because
I really liked it and yeah I think I
might make enough for me and Alfie Nala
trust you to be like hoovering around
the skirting boards for any little bit
of fluff you can find I am going to be
throwing in a handful of raspberries
some strawberries and I'm going to kind
of
you
you
look how good this looks guys I know the
strawberry is really big but I wanted to
put a little strawberry on the other
side I'm going to do the taste test now
oh my god that is so good this would be
a really good breakfast smoothie if any
of you want to make it a lot of you are
always like oh I missed the guinea pigs
oh you never show the guinea pigs
anymore where are your guinea pigs
they're still here guys they just
require a lot less attention than a
puppy and they have each other but I
still talk to them get them out it is a
little bit difficult with Missy because
she's confused as to what they are so
it's not like I can let them run around
the house firstly because I think I
would lose them anyway but also I'm not
I don't know how Nala would react to
them running around um but here they are
sleeping you wanted to see them hi Percy
are you gonna say hello to everyone
hi mr. Nala look she just requires all
my attention all the time hello look
we're playing with the guineas now no no
who's that who's that is that Percy
fussy messy
look look how jealous she gets she's
like clambering all over me she's like
please just give me attention it then
stop being so antisocial back there I
can see you this is the favorite thing I
buy these all the time you might have
seen them a couple of times but they are
their favorite balls you can chew I
think that one's cranberry or something
you can chew the cardboard that there's
also hay inside and I put that one in
there this morning and they've already
chomped on it no no who's that is that
Pippin and Percy no leave his far alone
I didn't hi mister oh I love them so
much hi Nullah be gentle Pippin actually
loves Nala look be gentle but yes I
still have the guinea pigs and I still
love the guinea pigs just as much as I
love Marla look at their cute little
mouths it's so cute I was holding them
this morning and I was like they smell
so much nicer than a dog like a dog
smells like a dog and it's not exactly
like a pleasant smell but it's not
exactly a gross car it's just a dog
smell but the guinea pigs smell like
sawdust and hay and like I don't know
they just smell nicer um sorry Nala
so it's now a little bit later I've just
had a lovely chat with my chummy on the
phone I've got my lunch I've just done
some online shopping because it is
Eduardo's first birthday soon and
Darcy's fourth birthday I just find that
so crazy like I have known Darci since
she was a bump in Louise's tummy and now
she's going to be four years old so I'm
so excited about that because it's just
it's crazy and also very excited for
Eduardo's first birthday too so I've
been like looking for presents for them
I've also caused Asus can have a frozen
themed birthday so I've been looking on
like Pinterest at like frozen cakes and
then trying to kind of work out if
there's any one Brighton that can do
like an amazing frozen cake so I've been
doing that and I've got my lunch you

barking at your computer
basically because Nala is now in season
we hadn't really thought about that
we're going to go to a puppy training
class tonight so
Alfie's mum obviously goes with fuzz and
we normally technology we go or not like
I know it's like normal for a dog to go
through it but I was just unsure whether
or not the male puppies would find it
all a bit overwhelming but we asked the
lady and she said it's mostly bitches
bitches in the class so it doesn't
really matter so now Alfie is making his
way over here and then we are going to
go to the class although we are going to
be a bit late and I really hate being
late for things when there's already
people like sat down doing what they're
meant to be doing like we're just going
to casually like stroll in like sorry
were late hopefully without that pink
pig it's so noisy she always likes the
most noisy toys she also loves mark mark
