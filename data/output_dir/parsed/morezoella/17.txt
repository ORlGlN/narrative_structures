good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 21
I feel like this year it's gone really
really right I'm hiding this I can't
cope with this always being in the
background so that's so far where can I
hide it right I'm hiding it behind this
curtain see if Alfie can find it yeah I
feel like this year vlogmas or december
has gone so incredibly quickly who else
feels like that I just feel like I've
blinked and it's like the end of
December now and I'm not saying like
it's been easier this year because all
see I'm not a daily vlogger so filming
every single day and uploading every
single day it's harder for me than like
just uploading once a week and uploading
a vlog every now and then but I really
really enjoy it and I don't think I
found it easier this year but I feel
like maybe because I've just been doing
it every year now it's like I just
instantly get back into filming and
uploading I was like a schedule like I'm
kind of getting used to it as a schedule
now so I think that's probably why but
yeah it just it's honestly baffling how
quickly it's gone like me and now if we
still have so much to do and we have
like three days to do it I need to make
oh I need to make a list today of
everything we still have left to do
because there's like really little
things like go and collect the piano
from Alfie's parents make the piano wrap
the piano and make sure we have all the
food for Christmas Day and Boxing Day
and Christmas Eve which I do need to
make a list for I want to buy foliage
because I want to put it in the table I
need to set the table up for Christmas
Day I need to buy a water jug it seems
like loads of really little things and I
do feel like maybe I put a little bit
too much pressure on myself because I
want to make it like the most perfect
day ever
sure I could just be a lot more relaxed
and not care about foliage on the table
and not really care about a water jug
because we've got a tap there and it is
a really matter but I'm such a
perfectionist and I really enjoy hosting
so I want it to be perfect for everybody
I don't want everybody to have like the
best Christmas day they've ever had I
also just want to make sure we've got
everything that everybody wants so if
there's like a certain drink that
someone really wants or a certain
Christmas nibble that someone really
wants every year for the past couple of
years we've done Christmas Day at
Alfie's mum and dad's and they always
throw the most amazing Christmas and
everyone has like the best time and
Amanda always makes so much effort so I
just want to do the same that also means
there's a big old list of things that
myself and Alfie still need to do or
last everything we've brought back from
work shift so we also need to tell you
that way
just tidying the house like I said in
yesterday's vlog I need to sort out the
spare bedrooms because I did not get
time yesterday I came home I think we
probably got back here at about 8:00 I
fell asleep on the sofa at 8:00 and then
I woke up and went to bed I don't know
what time that was and then I slept till
7:00 that's 11 hours sleep that's not
normal
it's really not normal was very needed
though I feel so much better this
morning and now I'm gonna go film my p.o
box which you'll have already seen just
filmed the PIO box part of my video for
yesterday and there was a little bull
ball that had treats in it for Nala and
she's had two and now what are you doing
she's just barking at it because she
wants another one I almost want to just
leave the camera so you can see what
she's doing it's so funny
she was trying to get back oh my god
yes saved by me I should have left my
camera running upstairs because it turns
out me now if we've been calling Nala to
come down as she didn't and that other
bag that was completely sealed shut
she'd ripped it open and eaten all three
treats from inside it what a little
greedy madam also kind of clever because
she doesn't open anything ever that I've
never known her to open or unwrap will
rip open anything nothing
Fionna treat hi you've been naughty
you're like Houdini no I was gonna give
you one of those but you you've just
eaten the whole pack so you can wait til
later for that pick up my pom-pom jumper
bloomin love this jump I actually just
ordered another one from Zara they had
another pom-pom jumper in stock girl can
never have too many pom-pom jumpers is
what I've heard what a bit of a sorting
out morning did my PA box I actually
have another Pierre box arriving today I
believe now I'm just trying to sort out
the pure box put away the bits I need to
put away I actually have Nullah get your
head out of that bag you will suffocate
- my dear I've got bits in here I need
to sort out I just realized I've been
sent a burp cushion look at that it's
kind of like my print in the bathroom
yeah this print I thought was very apt
for the bathroom today's just a little
bit of a sorting day Alfie's headed into
town and I've been I've been in a khole
and I've had lunch and I don't know why
I said that
lunch and I've watered all my
houseplants I had left it a bit long but
thankfully they were all ok oh I also
need to look through the Radio Times
I still haven't looked through this yet
yeah
I need to do that I'm going to leave it
out so I don't forget I'm so excited for
the Call the Midwife Christmas special
if any of you have never seen it before
you need to set your TVs to record it if
you're not going to be able to watch it
I feel like I don't really watch too
much TV on Christmas Day but let me know
if you're a TV watcher on Christmas Day
do you all sit round and watch a certain
thing I know that doctor who is a lot of
people's favorite on Christmas Day this
might come as a bit of a shock to some
of you is that something I should
probably do turn that rhyme I've never
watched it so maybe this year no can you
just start it on a Christmas special I
don't really know anyway I'm gonna
tackle this room feel free to watch if
you'd like
right I'm now moving on to the guest
room I feel like this is pretty much
done the only people that have stayed in
this is poppy and Shawn so and I don't
know who our Papa Shirin and Amanda and
Nick is gonna want this room but I think
it's pretty much done apart from Alfie's
like Xbox that an Xbox was that a
Playstation oh that's the PlayStation
one thing I do need to tidy is all my
products that I've had here from taking
photos or filming videos with them I had
them all in this room so I'm going to
take them up and put them back in the
storage now I can hear it but I don't
know where she is
right now I've got this pile I'm gonna
put it all into these shelves neatly and
then I'm gonna know where everything's
at this is like so satisfying to do I
love this little bit of storage that I
have this is basically my friends and
family cupboard so every time they want
something they come to this cupboard and
they can take whatever they like it's
actually looking quite empty down there
but also it's my never-ending supply
because obviously I need to use them as
well but yeah for any of you that still
have a little bit of Christmas shopping
left to do or stocking buying I'm gonna
give you like the quickest breakdown of
what you still have available cozy

Italia cupboards are fully stocked I'm
happy with that I'm trying to shut the
radiator also you may have noticed in
yesterday's video when I was going
through my peer box I didn't open this

some of you that I didn't open it huh so
I'm gonna open it now oh my goodness

balloon Nala she's not sure oh okay it's
stuck in okay I gotta try and get this

Happy New Year from all of us at Lockett
and Provence cute well thank you very
much for your hot air balloon it's
divine I don't know where to hang it but
I can't possibly get rid of this ever so
I made myself a list and so far today
I've ticked off three things on my list
I don't know how that's happened I'm
such a like task starter but I'm not
very good at finishing one task before
moving on to the next one so I've
currently got like three different tasks
going on at the same time which means
nothing's getting ticked off you like me
and you struggle to finish something
completely before starting something
else I get bored and then I leave it and
think I'll come back to that in a bit
let me start the other thing when I was
having this conversation with my mum
recently and she was like I'm exactly
the same
oh excuse my cold sore by the way it's
not a month of zoella vlogs if there's
no cold sore I'm now going to wrap some
presents because I got bored of tidying
and I wanted a change of scenery so I'm
gonna wrap presents whilst watching Mary
Barry's Christmas party which I didn't
get to watch the other day I don't know
where we were when it was on maybe Tanya
and James can't remember but Mary
Barry's Christmas party is on and you
know how much I love Mary Barry so I
feel like I'm gonna really enjoy this
right I've spent the last at least half
an hour wrapping some presents which are
all sorted gonna put them under the tree
and that's one more thing crossed off my
list which I'm very happy about oh I
need to take my suitcase upstairs which
is currently here so need to sort that
out now also just finished unloading one
p a box and have received more actually
this one's puppies I think yeah so I'm
going to take that to hers when I go and
get my nails done in a bit I'm
definitely done my day backwards like
I'm now getting ready in the evening I
wrapped up a few more present and wax
and clothes on and now I'm getting ready
to go to Poppy's because we're having
our nails done I've got my cat Kitson
twinkle-twinkle jumper on which is so
festive and cute and now I'm just
putting on like really basic skin care
and makeup
basically when I get back I want to have
a shower
so because I didn't get time to have one
and I have been running around all day
the car she's spitting you look funny
Nala I'm actually really happy with my
skin right now my spots like gone thank
goodness and that cleared up a lot
quicker than usual a little bit of urban
decay
kid concealer it's definitely not the
right shade for me I have so many in
here I don't know what shade is what
that'll do maybe put a little bit of
collection under my eyes cuz that's like
super heavy yeah snoring how is she even
falling asleep that quickly must take
after me although I'm not sure I could
curl up on a carpet and fall asleep
a little bit of Tanya burr peonies

but of precisely my brow by benefit in
me I but I'll I'm gonna have to lean
real forward for this little bit of
mascara and then I'm gonna go for a red
lip what I might do although I have this
one actually by Bobbi Brown which is
what they put in the goodie bag well it
feels very like luxe lip color in retro
red it feels very glide II very
moisturizing smooth the hair down and
we're gonna do a low bun there we go
done very simple and very quick and I'm
going to do a little snow Ella spritz mm
oh I need to take Alfie's wash bag
