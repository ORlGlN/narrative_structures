like it and I've got my little like
Baker boy hats on this is from ASOS and
these trousers are from and other
stories I just need to work out what

coat because my gosh it is cold it was
almost like after Halloween it was
winter it was so weird the first of
November outside was freezing and the
whole like look it's all misty I kind of
love it because actually feels like
winter now which oh I have my nails done
yesterday I don't know if you're gonna
be able to see the color of them because
they're like openly glitter
hmm oh my god so pretty I am obsessed
maybe you need to put them in different
light yeah I love them and these are my
real nails guys have you ever known me
to have nails like this then my real
nails Alfie still in bed so I don't know
he's coming to breakfast I would quite
like if he did come because it would be
fun but I've been packing up all the
Halloween stuff so sad ready for another
year although I think I might leave
these candles out because they're good
for fireplaces for Christmas but I'm
starting to make a pile of the plates
the big old pumpkin saying the scariest
masks at Alfea had and the pumpkins and
then I filled these three boxes I do
need to properly go through it and
decide what I want to keep the next year
or not but for now we've put them in
these boxes to put back up up in the
attic ready for another year of
Halloween fun look at this pretty little
spiderweb that's just about to get
absolutely ruined because I'm about to
drive this car is so pretty dummy
sorry spider I just realized the whole
of this roof is like covered in cobwebs
we're in sixth now I can take my coat
off yeah poppy and Sean and Matt change
okay that's thank you is it almost like
that time that me and alfie both went to
wait roses yellow jumps on and we look
like dickhead minions what I remind you
of basically I was driving along the
road so much car no boy
I wasn't to people just to people stand
in the bus stop and they both had like
color jeans on like ecology yeah
basically they were just standing near
each other they didn't know each other
but they were both dressed like minions
and I said oh breakfast has arrived to
flip a poppy she was like I don't just
want a normal breakfast the biggest
breakfast you can find it is exactly
what you could just I think there's more
there's more Shawn's got one just like
you know we've got two of these
saucepans sure they'd say we finished
breakfast it was delish and now we've
come in Tai Chi Chi Thanh a little nose
around because this shop is lovely and
it smells delectable I would single out
feed some of his favorite vegan sausage
rolls from bow which is most effects

oh yeah I love it I love that jacket and
that hat together 1212 if you can't do a
look look in front of a cheese shop then

look this is you you wanna read it look
she's more interested in the cab and
well thank you LAN dear that's very cute
and Nala enjoyed the pictures coming out
to get petrol and I've sent Alfie in on
a mission to get me a chocolate bar I
have no idea what he's picked he's
having a good think though said if he
brings me out a whisper or a bounty then
that's like top tier good boyfriend
points I think he's still trying to make
up his mind though he obviously wasn't
that confident with his choice do you
think that's not but that's like
cheating though excuse me where's my
chip I did beat you up a whisper
boyfriend points if you've got me a
whisper about you Oh as well why would
you do that don't like okay I don't like
your key right that's it it's been one
of those days where I just haven't
filmed a lot because I've been doing
things I can't really film myself and
Alfie actually just went and viewed I'm
really out of breath so just run right
to the top of the house to get my camera
run run back down again ah me now he
actually just wanted some office spaces
which is very cool I don't know if you
guys know oh to be honest I've always
worked from home
I enjoy working from home but as I want
to do more things and I know I need to
grow more of a team I know I can't make
everyone come to work in my house and
actually it's probably not the best for
the whole kind of work home divided and
also ASMI now if you're getting older at
some point there will be children and at
that point I don't want like a team
working in my house I want my house to
be my house so planning ahead and I
think just taking on like a bit of a new
adventure really I'm quite excited about
it but we are looking for a bigger
office somewhere we can really make our
own and make really cool and so we went
and viewed loads of different places
today which was really exciting like I
haven't felt this excited about
something in such a long time like
work-wise just because I don't know it
just feels like something really fresh
and new and yeah I mean I don't know how
long it takes to do these things but oh
my god you made me jump cry but yeah
that's what we've been doing all day
so Poppy's here by the way hello it's
like you never left
it's like you came back with me I pretty
much did yeah
and now I am unpacking lots of bits and
pieces you may have seen that me and
Joey and Daniel did an autumn swap we're
gonna do a Christmas one so I have
already gathered lots of different bits
and pieces that I really want to send
them where I was quite excited to do the
Halloween one it's like nothing compared
to how excited I am to do the Christmas
one just because I think I do Christmas
quite well and UK does Christmas really
well as well so this time I feel like
I've got a lot more choice of things to
send them and lots of things that I love
at Christmas and like I don't know just
I know lots of things they can't get
where they are one being the white
company winter candle which I think they
will absolutely love saying that I also
purchased myself B oh my god the winter
candle that is this size it is joy
Norman I really wanted to get it to put
in the dining room in the middle of the
table because I just thought it would be
so good and it smells so good like for
me this candle is like if future mayor
Christmastime
oh so I'm going to put that out now do
you like it is it Christmas sprout oh do
you know I feel like that boy in love
actually dressed up as the lobster you
put that on yeah you have to work at the
same time that was poppy thing she was
like okay but I have to do some work and
I was like okay but I'm gonna make sure
you do do some work whilst ice-1 around
my house in a sprout ha
I'm gonna give you guys a sneak peek of
Joey and Daniel's current package Oh
sneak peek little card and a cushion
that I thought they would like because
it's it is Christmassy because it has
like Christmas trees and special
delivery and presents in the back of the
car but it's a very light London themed
so I thought that would be quite nice to
send them and then some more like
decorative bits because we've both told
each other that like themes of our
houses for Christmas we're taking it
very seriously I'm so excited
poppy look at me right now I'm opening a
Christmas tree wearing this borough on
my head I feel like you need to get at
one of me putting the Christmas tree at
the mall a sprout
Blakeman have a that's the bottom oh
it's a oh
so I'm thinking yes Amster wearing this
I'm thinking that I'm going to put the
tree here in this little corner I think
it would look really cute there that is
so cute
little Christmas tree oh it has lights
okay you plug those in done look at me
obviously I need to change my autumn
wreath to a Christmasy wreath but now we
have a little mini Christmas tree and I
love it I think either Alfie bought this
for me last year or I bought it for
myself but it is a santa's final
preparations 1000 piece puzzle now if
there's one thing you might not know
about me is that I am literally barking
mad but also I actually really like
doing puzzles and I never do them
because I start them and then either the
space I'm using to do them I need to use
for something else so I have to just
scrap the whole thing and put it back in
the box or I just don't find time to do
it but I do enjoy doing it I think it's
very relaxing so what I did was I bought
myself a fold away or like a puzzle
board that you build your puzzle on
because then you can move it so if we
want to use a dining room table between
like now and Christmas which obviously
we will I can pick this up if I put
these brackets on and just lift the
whole thing and move it which has
completely changed the way in which I
puzzle make now so that's the puzzle I'm
gonna set up I think it's quite fun to
do when you're just like chatting with
just everything really I
puzzles but she make huge ones like this
because oh my god oh my god I actually
this is a thousand pieces is more than I
anticipated let's begin do you start by
turning over all the pieces of puzzle
that's what I want to know or you just
start looking through and if a piece
grabs your attention like an edge then
you take all the edges I think that's
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take all the
edges and build the outside there could
be some of you out there that are
complete puzzle pros that might say I'm
not doing it the right way but let me
know because this is not something that
I am going to finish in a day
hello everybody it's Wednesday today and
I am in the house on my own because
Alfie has gone to Lisbon for a Web
Summit which is all very businessí and
exciting hence why I'm not there no
honestly I don't think talking in a web
or web summit is something I'm quite
comfortable with just now um but he's
gone with Dave and Alfie is like very
into like business and he loves that
stuff and so does Dave so the two of
them I'm sure we'll be having a whale of
a time I've just filmed a video hence
why I'm turning off my lights
I really enjoyed filming actually let me
just turn my camera off
I always forget and then my batteries
died it was a YouTube tag that I've kind
of made up I don't know if anyone else
has done it knowing me I brought it I've
bloody said in the video like I don't
know if anyone's done this before I
think I've made it up and there'll be
someone who's like asked all the same
questions or something I don't know I
also filmed my autumn makeup which I
need to edit and upload tonight because
I didn't upload anything at the weekend
for some reason the weekend just
disappeared and I was like what's
happened I haven't had time to film I
haven't had time to essentially do
anything I don't know what happened
there yeah so you're getting two videos
this week on my main channel instead
which I hope you're happy with I also
just edited my Halloween vlog well
that's a lovely still of mark there
which again I hadn't realized I needed
to edit I don't know quite where I've
been the last like three days I think
I've just been in like house mode like
I've been trying to sort the house out
I've been trying to tie up lots of loose
ends with kind of more working stuff
I've had lots of products that I need to
be testing formulations for which is
very exciting I think I've just had a
lot of like
more homey and work like email II admin
stuff to do which has meant the creative
side has got a weird hair on my lens
which men that the creators side has
sort of being forgotten about but that's
the stuff I bloody love so I've just sad
edited my Halloween vlog so again I hope
you don't mind that that's like a little
bit late sometimes I've got the iPhone X
so I set this up yesterday that took a
long time I didn't have the right
software update or some things that
would work for a long time then it asked
me for a password that I'm almost 99%
sure I'd never set up but eventually I
did get it right what are you doing with
this but generally I have had a very
busy couple of days so I haven't picked
up my camera but now I've got it now
I've got you and I have oh and I have a
boyfriend less house but I've got Nala
and that's all I need to keep me company
you're not great with chat but it's okay
I can look past that because you're so
effing cute I'm saying mister her as her
eyes are like rolling back into her head
because she's fully sleep Oh actually
you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
bring my laptop downstairs and edit
downstairs with the fire on and a
Christmas film on because if that aim
goals don't know what is I made the
mistake of sleeping with the window open
last night because I fell asleep
downstairs in front of the fire with my
onesie on under a blanket and I woke up
honestly couldn't breathe I think I'd
like dehydrated I was like a raisin I'd
shriveled up so I went to bed to the
window because I was way too hot and
that meant waking up the opposite of a
raisin no way if you're very cold I
guess I was just frozen
so that was fun and now the house won't
warm up I feel like all I've done is
talk about yeah I'm sorry I think this
is what happens when I just haven't left
the house in like three days I get to
the point where I'm like right now
Alfie's gone I need to talk to someone
so it's when I get my camera out and I
vlog and I talk to you just quickly I'm
going to oh yes that is a Christmas
wreath on the door just quickly I
thought I would give you a rundown of
what this month will entail because if
any of you have been subscribed to
either this channel or my zoella channel
for a while then you will know that
Christmas for me is probably the busiest
time of year content wise because I film
a video every single day for this
channel and it's called vlogmas so I
film from the 1st of December up until
Christmas Eve which means there is a
video on this channel every day from the
2nd to the 25th yeah that's right lots
of people do build miss in different
ways some film the whole of the month
some film on the 30th of November up
until Christmas Day I don't think that's
the traditional way of doing vlogmas so
that's not what I do I do the starting
on the first ending on Christmas Eve and
the last two years I did 24 days of
zoella which was also a video every
single day on my zoella channel I told
myself I wouldn't do it again
this year because it almost broke me so
I'm not doing it this year but for those
of you that I've seen asking me on
Twitter if I'm still going to be
uploading on that channel yes I am
there's still going to be lots of fun
Christmas content that's just not gonna
be video every single day because if I'm
honest and running out of Christmas
ideas guys that also means that I
prepare quite a lot of my Christmas
content in November so there probably
won't be as many vlogs this month
because it's technically one of my
busier months because I have to tie
everything up because
I take December off from management and
meetings I basically don't have any
meetings through December my PA does not
work from my office here it's like a
whole month where I just film and enjoy
Christmas and I really really look
forward to it because it's rude to no it
feels like it's time off but not because
it's like you're filming and editing
every single day but I really really
thoroughly enjoy it so that does also
mean I have to type everything up before
the end of November so this month is
busy and in short you might see less of
me but then you will be sick of me by
the time December rolls around whew
it is happening I've got call the
Midwife Christmas special from last year
on very healthy about this because I
absolutely loved it and it's been a
while since I've been able to watch Call
the Midwife I really hope there's
another Christmas special this year
please let me know Call the Midwife if
you've got another Christmas special
this year that I can get excited about
because I've got lunch in the oven and
I'm about to start editing the video I
just filmed a bloody ostrich still here
still editing although I have just
finished but it's now dark I found long
it's taking me it's now dark why do I
take so long to edit I'm now watching
Nativity 2
stranger stranger in the manger that's
an entirely different film danger in the
manger is on prime on Amazon so I'm
watching it oh my god I'm so excited for
Christmas oh my god oh my god
so the film is nearly finished and I'm
not gonna lie to you I think this is the
first Christmas who have ever watched
that I don't like the whole thing is
made me feel like I'm on crack well I
know what that's like but I think maybe
it's just very very very young like I'm
talking really small kids or maybe
that's not true because a lot of the
Christmas films I like her for kids I
think there's too much cheese and like
school play songs for my life gang I did
however love the first one I think this
one was just like really ramped up like
really ramped up all the singing but
there are elements of it that I did like
like I love mr. poppy as a character I
think he's fab I don't know why I'm
doing like a bloody review of this film
I think it's cuz it's a Christmas film
and also just because I feel so shocked
that I did not like that what are you
thinking she's like please leave me
alone
I'm trying to sleep you don't like the
film either
donar would you know the Christmas feel
if you want thirsty before watching this
are you thirsty now Alfie always says I
gulped really loudly and I actually do
kind of agree with him I can't help it I
think what I'm gonna do now is go
upstairs take off my makeup put on some
comfy PJ's and read some Christmas
magazines in bed it's time for my
nighttime routine put you in the
cupboard clean flannel Liz Earle cleanse
Apollo I do you like to come with that
so exactly wipe it away hey now I'm
gonna use my bro see a milky jelly
cleanser and just do a couple of pumps
of that
get my flannel again wipe away I'm a
plumber with all other dirty smiles
right now I am going to use my Claude
you oh and that's my friends is all I'm
doing to my skin tonight would you take
my little earrings out yeah all clean
raise my PJs this room is so cozy I've
got a little Christmasy candle on down
there all my Christmas magazines so I
bought these when me and Bach did our
Halloween shopping actually and I have
already flipped through a couple but
there are still some that I need to look
through so I am actually so excited to
get into bed I've got fresh sheets oh
you're all probably thinking oh don't
you miss Alfie
but it's so funny I was having this
conversation with someone the other day
I actually quite like just having a
night to myself that sounds like crazy
but it's quite nice like I like having
the opportunity to miss Alfie and I
think times like this they do give me
opportunity to miss him so I can be a
bit selfish and I can get into bed and I
can read my Christmas magazines and
watch watch things that I want to watch
on telly and also get to like text him
and stuff because we live together we
never like text each other or like speak
like that so it's quite nice when he's
away when I can be like hey like how's
your day and like what are you up to so
I actually really enjoy it obviously
it's only for one night and if this was
for like multiple nights then yes of
course
the novelty would wear off very quickly
of having the house to myself but for
one night it's very enjoyable I am going
to read through
Christmas magazines this one in
particular what's this one called this
one is called Christmas ultimate cause
he poked myself in the eye this one is
called ultimate Christmas and it has
Mary berry on it and Jamie Oliver and
Candis brown and lots of cool things and
also a free bar of chocolate even though
it's dark chocolate so I won't you do
yeah I'm gonna look through this and I
will see very soon I know I just said
bye but I hear I've got a film on now
it's actually jingle all the way but I
just wanted to ask something quickly
because I was having this discussion
with someone the other day and I don't
remember who it was maybe Holly or maybe
Katie or maybe it was Rochelle it was
someone and we were talking about how
whenever we were younger we would go to
bed and listen to tapes therefore I find
it easier now to fall asleep listening
to something whether that be a TV
program a film or a podcast or an audio
book whatever it is I have to be
listening to something because if I go
to go to if I go to sleep and it's
silence I think I think I think too much
like it's like I don't got anything else
to think about or listen to
therefore my mind goes into like
overdrive I don't actually sleep but I
find it so relaxing having something on
in the background when I go to bed who
is with me
do you prefer no noise at nighttime or
do you have to listen to something I
might do a Twitter poll right now
because I'm so interested to know how
many people listen to things before bed
because I've had this conversation with
so many people and they're like oh me
too hands down and as a kid I always
listened to something before going to
bed and I was like yeah I think that's
what it is I think it's because I did it
as a child I've always done it so now
I'm like if I'm not listening to
something it's weird but yeah just just
then as I was thinking about going to
sleep I was like I need to ask this
question
cuz I need to know I need to know if
you're a silent silent before bed kind
of person or you need something on in
the background let me know good night
and I love you
