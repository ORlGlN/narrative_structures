good morning everybody I am doing lots
of work today those 100 emails that I
said I had yesterday I have gone through
and I am also preparing videos and other
things I've just done my Sam Trini blog
post also just edited and uploaded
yesterday's vlog so this is something
that I picked up from Santorini is a
little brass man on a unicycle with a
top hat carrying a heart and it's
actually set in volcanic rock um so I
just thought that was really cute and
Alfie got one to answer didn't know me
and so did Marcus I don't know whether
they would have shown them on their
vlogs but I just really like Ken so I'm
gonna sit him here by my computer hey I
saw you going the tunnel Pippin hello hi
Percy are you going to come through the
tunnel come on
tippin's thumb party oh I missed them so
much wearing some real cozy slippers
today um and I also just realized that
it looks like I have a dog poo on my
head by the way I like it uh-huh uh-huh
found someone just sat chillin on the
sofa what you doing you're watching TV
are you munching on a little carrot oh
hello miss me Pippin is your carrot look
is little Matt all talking away about oh
this is why I love guinea pigs with
their little mouths and tongues
it's become very aware of the fact I'm
filming him while he's eating why is he
only moving his mouth when I'm talking
hello my name is Pippin and I'm a guinea
pig kara is my favorite food ego
that's what having guinea pigs makes you
turn into the crazy guinea pig lady now
enjoy your film
bye looks so tiny I am about to film all
my headaches literal tragic but that's
okay I'm about to film a video for the
all things hair Channel and it's going
to be like a Bollywood installed
hairstyle because I always see the
Kardashians kind of rocking those like
gems that sit in their partings and I
want to try and do something around that
so hopefully the next time you see me my
hair will look semi cool / okay
this is my finished Bollywood style hair
style I actually really really like it I
didn't go for a middle parting I just
kind of went for like this kind of big
fringe I'm sorry I'm looking in a mirror
as I'm talking to you
but I think it's really cool I kind of
wish I could get away with wearing these
more often I guess I could have I really
wanted to do there ain't nothing
stopping me and I've curled my hair as
well pretty it is now much later on and
I have been so busy today I almost feel
like I've been kind of non-stop just
doing lots of work you bits and pieces
and stuff that obviously I've had to
catch up with once I got back from my
holiday and I'm just been replying to
some of your comments on my previous
vlog which um I just love you guys a lot
I'm really hungry I'm craving pizza
I just wasn't much pizza in Greece and
you know I love pizza so um really
gutting we were supposed to be getting
the laptop that we'd ordered me and
Alfie specifically for filming since
4:00 on because it's PC only I believe
all right now it's PC only and and we
have access to the game early and we
obviously can't play it on a Mac so
we've got this laptop ordered got
delivered today and apparently it's
broken
so that's
crap I don't really know what we're
going to do because it took a while to
get delivered because it was like had
specific X I'm not really a computer
person but it was built so I think I was
going to have to try and get that fixed
tomorrow maybe um and yeah I'm just
really gutted because I'm so excited to
start playing Sims 4 and come yeah so
just have to keep waiting oh so sorry
about that guys um I also need to go
