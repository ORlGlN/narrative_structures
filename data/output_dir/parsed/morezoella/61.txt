with you the last range that we brought
out that was kind of similar to this one

biggest cold sore here which is why it
looks like I've had an odd lip filler on
one side of my lip for the last launch
that came out which was last year around
this time with Sweet Inspirations and

year it gets harder and harder to make
it more epic than the one before but I

and ask for the whole day
okay you know I'm glad we've taken lots
of pictures and got all the instagrams
and the Instagram stories but basically
this ice cream van is here for the rest
of the day now we I think we're going to
deserve smite cream I think we haven't
actually tweeted out that we're here yet
so I think we're going to do a little
Instagram story and then serve some ice
cream and then we probably head off
before it gets a little bit crazy but
yeah I'm really happy also another thing
worth mentioning is that this launch is
launching internationally this is the
first launch dollar Beauty have done
that's lost internationally in multiple
different countries which is all
exciting so as you're watching this is
out in the UK then it's going to Germany
USA Australia Norway Canada and Ireland
from the 19th which is so soon and so
exciting so if you are in any of those
countries you should also get your hands

time everyone in the UK can which I was
so happy about Italy look see we've now

well yeah and you play with a squirrel
in the shade hello
we getting jealous the fuzz is getting
all the attention it's very hot out so
you're going to have to go inside in a
minute because neither of you seems to
understand to get too hot we must go
inside Oh
was he showing off now oh okay so this
is now the section of the vlog where I
am going to chat you through everything
that's in the range and just yeah give
you a bit of a debrief which I'm sure
you've all been waiting for
there are eight items in the jelly and
gelato range much like the other ranges
that I bring out across like summertime
it's kind of like this cool collection
with its own scent and we actually have
how many formulas do we have one two
three four like a lot of new formulas so
I'm so excited to share them with you
first thing I'm going to show you is the
makeup bags ads or the collections
there's generally a makeup bag that goes
alongside it because you guys love a
makeup bag or something to put all your
bits and pieces in and kind of staying
in a similar vein to last year's kind of
flip over bag we've gone to this one
which I mean these colors I am obsessed
with I love this like peachy pink and
this really lovely mint color and again
it's like this like faux leather lovely
squishy bag and this one goes up on a
diagonal here is the table it looks like
a you know the pink waivers that you
stick in ice creams it looks like one of
those yeah so this is just a beauty bag
this is it with the label this is it
without a label and it's got a little
triangle and a little circle on the lips
I've actually been using this for a
months I've had to edit out of so many
blogs and I can finally finally use it
freely across my channel next thing I'm
going to show you is this this is the
pink bath wafers moisturizing bath
scissor so we have never done a
moisturizing bath visitor before this is
something I was so keen to do because as
well as being like a huge bath junkie I
also absolutely love doing things in my
bath but a small knife which I feel like
we kicked off with the other bar fizzes
I also enough ones that kind of like
benefit your skin in some way so that is
where we have developed a moisturizing
one I'm so happy with it it's also in a
baby pink color which again we've never
put color in the inner fizzes so I'm
very very happy with this
these look like to again wases like pink
wafers that you put in your ice cream
and I am obsessed with these they are
enriched with shea butter and extracts
of LD LD flower why can't I talk today
LG flower and pomegranate to help
brighten smoo
and tone so yes it's all in there so
this entire range with one of the
hardest cents the whole time I have done
zoella Beauty this was the hardest cent
to nail down as well as diserves is
coming out on Christmas but for some
reason this year I just could not make
decision they were cooing and throwing
with which option we wanted to go down I
wanted it to smell summery I also didn't
want it to be too sweet and too sickly
because that's not a fragrance I would
personally wear so then I would really
struggle to enjoy it when it's my own
product range and I would never want to
bring out a scent that I didn't
personally like even if 90% of you would
have loved it I wouldn't be able to do
that it has to be something I genuinely
love and accept that I have picked
myself so we were tuning our own with
different fruits and different creams
and different ways of combining those to
make a summary smell that has a bit of a
sweetness to it but is not too sweet so
we finally settled on an elderflower and
double cream scent which I it's actually
quite difficult to describe but it is a
beautiful smell and I'm really excited
for you guys to smell it I feel like
it's so different from any of the other
smells I've ever done and I think it's
quite universal like I think a lot of
people will like it
it's definitely going to remind me of
this summer which I'm happy about
next up is the shower sole it is a body
wash and a game it's like the other body
washes that we've brought out but it has
the lovely smell and it's also in this
like amazing packaging packaging was it
has some kind of like pop arty 1920s
vibe and I don't know just like we
wanted to be quite current with the
colors and the patterns and I'm obsessed
with how these came out I absolutely
love them lathers nicely smells amazing
keeps you clean it's what I feel
everyone needs in the shower right now
and it's also very refreshing to the
smell which in the hot weather is nice
next up we have the actual fragrance
much like all the other ranges that will
always be the core fragrance that is
within all the other products and we've
gone for like this opaque bottle or with
the color is called gelato it has the
gold lid it's actual glass it's really
beautiful I'm going to spray some now ah
love it
body pudding this packaging I love so
this is kind of like the packaging from
the update to the Classic Collection
where we started putting things in
little tubs because this is a jelly and
gelato range it seemed only right that
we would have tubs within the packaging
I have stuff on my lip got this
packaging has the little pop of yellow
and again it had this really beautiful
like purpley blue color kind of
periwinkle blue a purple and again the
gold and you guys have to see what this
looks like I'm going to I'm going to
like this burner hmm
I feel like I should have put a little
ice cream scoop with this to get the
product out that would have been really
cute I guess kind of unnecessary but we
do it has tiny little pink bits in it
that disappear into your skin and again
smells amazing this is a moisturizer by
the way did I say it was moisture I feel
like edges that it was body pudding but
it's a moisturizer cream scrub this is a
new formulation that we have been
working on for so long I'm so happy I'm
finally able to like bring out the cream
scrub let me read you the back so if
your skin a treat this indulgent mix of
polishing sprinkles and rich cream is
infused with extracts as well
pomegranates help brighten smooth and
tone massage into wet skin then rinse
thoroughly for a super soft finish look
at the color of it or it looks like a
sorbet mmm and again smells wonder to be
using the bath or shower next thing
which the packaging on this I am so
happy with is the shower shake
look at these look at that it has a
little straw on it it's so cute
moisturizing body wash again this is a
new formulation we've never done
anything like this before it's a body
wash to use in the shower or the past
and it has moisturizing properties so
not only are you cleaning you're also
moisturizing and leaving your skin
feeling extra bit soft I'm obsessed with
this I'm currently using this in my
shower it's amazing
I found I always feel so weird saying
like something I have done and that has
my name on is great but this is honestly
one of my favorite products right now I
love this so much and it looks like a
cute like milkshake and last but by no
means least another thing we have never
done before that I am so so excited to
share with you is this this is the bath
frosting which is above milk powder milk
powder I feel like is quite a current
trend has been around for a really long
time but it's something that I've been
using quite a lot in my own Barb's so
it's something I definitely wanted to
attempt to do myself which I'm so happy
obviously I didn't come up with this
formulation I mean if it was just me in
a lab it would be a very different story
so like the team were formulating this
and it honestly I love this so much it
says take a dip with this moisturizing
bar frosting and rich with extracts of
elephants for a grant to help soften
brighten and tone empty one sachet under
warm running water and swirl until the
water turns milky white so your water
goes like a milky consistency and it
just it just feels really like luxurious
and indulgent and I like it it's a
different alternative to like bubbles
and it's also a different alternative to
bath bombs but it still leaves your skin
feeling really lovely and this I think
is one of my favorite packaging out of
all of them I think this is like one of
my favorite things like this would just
look so cute set next to the bath it's a
little tin lid and you pop it open and
inside you have four sachets
so you have full baths in this
essentially and each sachet looks like
this how cute is that I just feel like
we nailed this one I don't know I'm so
happy with the whole range but when
we're able to work so hard on a new
formulation and to see that come
together and then for other people to be
able to get a hold of it it's just so
exciting
so yes those are the jellien July 2
products they are available now online
as you're watching this they're
available on feel unique and they're
available online at Superdrug they will
be in stores in Superdrug stores next
week so if you don't want order online
but she would rather smell the products
which is totally understandable I get
that that you could then you only have
to wait till next week to go and pick
them up with some of them for yourself
one other thing obviously that I kind of
briefly mentioned in the vlog apart was
that this is the first international
release of any of my ranges
we've always we have been like getting
the products into lots of different
countries and I always hear you guys
when you're like bring it here bring it
here bring it here so we are trying
really hard to get it into your
countries but it does not it's not to be
me as you think it is so we are now in
so many different countries which is so
amazing I'm going to leave an end slate
and links in the description of
countries that it's available and where
to buy but this launch in particular is
launching this week in Germany Island
the USA Norway Australia and where am I
missing straight-in Norway Germany I'm
missing one UK Germany USA Australia
Norway Canada and Ireland so I missed
out Canada sorry Canada which has never
happened before and it's such a huge
moment for Ella Beauty because being
able to launch a range in the UK is
insane but being able to launch the same
range across seven different country
is so exciting and it's a huge huge step
UPS is a lot of beauty and we're all
really really excited about it so again
I will leave all that information in the
description box with this new launch
there will be lots of exciting things
happening across Superdrug stores in the
UK so you can look out for some jelly in
July toasting windows some little like
pop-up things the ice cream van like

broad but I will of course update you if
