exciting day because I get to show you
lots of new things that are coming out
this month it's this month how quickly
is that gone I've been working on these
things for like over a year and now I
can bet you all think you've been
working on this for so long
I hope you've been to the gym did you
have a great session I don't want

Halloween yeah I did by Nala this toy
from HomeSense yesterday basically I
went to HomeSense yesterday with poppy
and they have all the Halloween stuff so
I did get some Halloween decorations
because I want to do a Halloween party

are going to an apartment in London that
has been rented and we've basically
filled it chock-a-block all the rooms
with all the new stuff that's coming out
so that's the zoella Beauty Christmas
and some of the new things that nobody's
seen yet
are also in the apartment so I am so
excited to see what it looks like I have
no idea I've seen mood boards but I
don't I didn't want anyone to ruin it
for me so when we get there it's going
to be the first time I've seen the
apartment like fully decked out so I'm
really really excited Alfie and Shaun

time is poppy and Zoe
yeah wait isn't that strange look okay
over okay put your
yeah oh my god oh my god hey oh oh my
god oh oh my god it's so cool there's a
Christmas tree oh my god okay am I going
to say hello to everyone and then I'll
properly show you oh hi welcome to my
apartment come on in as you can see
you're stepping inside the extraordinary
hashtags a little apartments I've got
out via the cameraman and I'm going to
show you around because there's so much
to see so we're going to get started hey
guys you said you wanted one take care
this is the bedroom now one thing I have
been working on which I haven't got to
share with you guys yet is that I have
done candles and diffusers as part of
their well a lifestyle they know I've
done in quote quote air quotes maybe
just cuz it doesn't really feel very
real yet but so what a lifestyle is now
a thing and I am so excited because you
guys know how much I love all things
home and interiors and lifestyles so in
here is where we can kind of show off
the candles the diffusers and a few more
of the kind of cozier things candles we
have Daisy picking Lazydays seaside
stroll my Eden and gingerbread village
one of my favorite things though I'll
show you with this one cuz I've already
opened this one is how they open so they
open like this and then in each one
there's a different picture that
corresponds with the scent which I just
think is so cool I've never seen a box
open like that before so I'm very happy
with that couldn't tell you a favorite
because I love them all so much
obviously gingerbread village is
gingerbread my tea
it's quite floral seaside stroll is very
fresh Lazydays is kind of more of a
linen ease scent very nice for the
bedroom and daisy picking is also kind
of like fresh meadows which I really
like love them all then we have the
diffusers I'm so happy with these we've
got one in every corresponding candle
but also one that isn't a candle quite
yet because we need to affect it but
homemade treats is basically like the
tastiest smelling cupcake you have ever
smelled
basically smells like cupcakes oh my
gosh yeah for the past four months
just to know it Marc probably knows this
scent very well because he's staying in
the guest room quite a few times so
that's what that smells like
and then because obviously this is open
to bloggers press and on Saturday fans
and winners of the competition are
coming here as well so we've set them
all out this is Daisy picking with
daisies and you've got seaside straw
with all the little shells but this
giant Z which is the coolest thing ever
I kind of want one of these in the house
why should we had a big amz okay so cool
Lazydays with some feathers and actually
look that's my legs a lot of you are
like I wonder what that shoots for it
was for the inside of a candle box
you've never known and then might Eden
which I do have to say is up there with
one of my favorites the ascender is
based on the smell of my garden when I
look back at work sure because in the
summer my mum had so many flowers and
the garden just not amazing so that's
what that candle is basically based on
and then we just got a really beautiful
sleigh it's actually a gift set and as
you can
and we diffuser remindin so you can get
both
in there and this which is my NASA fix
everything cushion these aren't actually
the final ones you might think they look
a bit not full that's because these have
been hand stuffed by everyone who's
helped put this apartment together just
so we show the pom-poms have been hand
stitched on the real ones aren't going
to be stuffed manually at hand stitched
manually and they should be arriving
soon but this is just to give you an
idea I love this quote one of my
favorite quotes because Nats do you
expect this is a little gift set it's
called lazy days and it's these socks
which are inspired by the socks here on
this shoe and the lazy days candle so
that come through here into the ensuite
where we have new additions to the core
range that's the classic collection that
was the first collection that ever came
out we've got some new items added to it
we also have a bath full of balls with
Zen song cash scooper duper this is
foaming bath soap that you can scoop out
pop under running water pour in I just
think it's really fun in a tub like a
big old ice cream tub we also have
wondrous whip which is a whipped body
cream again you can kind of scoop out I
love the texture of this is really
really lovely because so many of you
loved the scrub
we brought the scrub back permanently
into the classic collection so you've
got scrub now and last but not least one
thing that has been so highly requested
and I was already on it from day one
it just took longer to develop and we
thought it would hand sanitizer
so this is called handle heart and it is
one of my favorite hand sanitizer
la doesn't smell too much of alcohol and
it doesn't dry your hands out I really
like it
there's a lot in it cool this way for
the knee
also can we just talk about the lovely
touches of this apartment
look at that I also really want this in
our bedroom so cool through here we've
got the amazing Christmas setup so we've
got fireplace we've got the kissing
station this has got the lip balms here
so people can try these we've got this
beautiful display here with lots of the
zoella beauti Christmas stuff on which I
have already shown you guys but
obviously it's new and it's coming out
soon so we wanted to have in the
apartment and also because then we get
to make it really festive then we've got
these which are the power hampers and a
beautiful fireplace all up the minis so
far so you can recline so a less
chauffeur on the sofa this is a selfie
spot you can stand here take a little
selfie perfect backdrop love it oh we've
got pop in the baking section this is
because as you guys know the Christmas
range is gingerbread themed so we have
the hand cream and we have some actual
gingerbreads that you can decorate the
fizz bars
obviously you can't eat these ones but
yeah so this is the gingerbread station
and then over there we've got far in a
jar and some cute little notes that
people can take away and read which is
very exciting over here we've got the
dining room table look at this it just
looks so impressive I kind of want my
dining room table to live I miss at
Christmas got the crackers you've got
the candles the ball balls full of
chalets then you've got the Christmas
tree and it's real close me I'm not
dessert at the top
it was actually quite difficult to
source a Christmas tree in September and
it's got the shower get the bubbles
shower gel on there we've also got like
all the bags and things put in really
cool perspex boxes which is so cool and
then lots of gifts under the tree which
I believe are actually gifts for the
viewers that come here on Saturday hello
look there's a cardboard cutout so you
can put this next to this moving on to
the office so as I was saying life style
is a new thing that I'm doing as I was
saying life style is something I have
not done before so I'm really really
excited to share the first load of
things with you so in the office is a
lot of new things we've got pencils
we've got notebooks
we've got post we've got mark there's a
range of different things I feel like
the best place to show you is probably
over here I also have a keyring I feel
how I have this on my keys how many
months I recovery four months minimum no
one noticed and I filmed it so many
times and nobody noticed I kept our
secret we've got the cushion has fits
everything again and then over here this
is one of my most favorite things topped
with cream and sprinkles and you screw
it on you know sometimes when you put
them on does it screw on yeah so that's
really good to know for sure if you put
it on properly you could screw it on so
is it good this is one of my favourite
thing that's called she designed a like
she loved its basically full of post-it
notes so you've got a small one here
small one here like normal kind of
post-its lists and then like a diary
style so each week you can tear it off
which I love this is also something
I'm just like obsessed with it says once
upon a time it's like ddosed it's like a
really lovely like pleather effect
marble inside and then there's four
really lovely quotes in here here's one
your vibe attracts your tribe and then
on the end it says the end at the back
even know in the end it's been a long
day it's very hot in here right so
that's that oh the mug comes in this
gift set so it says warm hands warm
heart and it actually comes with these
like adorable little gloves here yeah
yeah so they're little knitted
fingerless gloves and they're so cozy I
put it on the wrong hand there you go
and they match the tops and they do
match the socks the other thing I have
are bees which is the pottering around
storage parts I'm so excited about these
because I always have little pots for
pens pencils makeup brushes all
succulents and cactuses or cacti
so you've got one said blooming
marvelous which you can see here and
then one that says pick and there copper
and marble can't go wrong the pencils
right on point and then I decided to put
a little like sign off like normally how
you would sign off a letter or an email
so you've got hugs and kisses love from
your faithfully best wishes and yours
truly and they're in this like ombre
kind of neon peach color and I feel like
that is everything is that if they've
been through the whole apartment so I
really hope that you're excited about it
you can follow Zoe lifestyle

posting lots more photos of everything
anyway but this all comes out this month
