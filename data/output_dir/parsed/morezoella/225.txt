come here that's my boy I'm having a bit
of a declutter in my office I did have
one of these kind of a couple of weeks
ago but I have since acquired a crap ton
of photos so I'm kind of sorting them
out and putting them away into a box so
which I thought would be quite funny to
share with you because you know it's
sort of personally are more sharing all
loving I found this picture which I kind
of feel like most people go through a
fairly awkward stage through their kind
of teen years for me this was around the
age of twelve and thirty
mean 11 12 13 were definitely my awkward
stages I just had my braces I I hadn't
I've started getting spots
I hadn't even even like looked at makeup
at this point and my eyebrows had been
untouched not there's anything wrong
with any of those things but you know
when you just kind of feel a little bit
more insecure than normal when you're
going through that stage I found a photo
of me going through that stage and I
kind of feel like that's quite rare
because sorry I'm sitting up and um I
just can't get comfortable because if I
sit right down I'm here oh I know put
you in this drawer okay so I kind of I
kind of avoided cameras at most cost at
this point in my life so it was quite
funny to find this um Here I am in my
awkward kind of teenager phase um I've
got my braces I've got my middle parting
my hair actually a similar length to
what it is now but very thick like very
thick indeed um and you know a little
bubble watch there and a little denim
skirt off the shoulder top I'm smiling
but deep down I'm like oh please don't
take a photo of me just want to share
that with you see if we've got any other
funny photos oh here's one from my
birthday
this was my happy birthday Zoey one two
three four five six seven eight ninth
birthday always count the candles there
we go
my mum made me a cake that said steps on
it and it was like the best thing ever
ah birthdays Oh buddy stink of you
farted Wow
oh my gnarly smart broccoli oh my
goodness what outfit is that that is
tragic and yes that is a hat
I don't know why my parents let me leave
the house like that cheers folks
shortest hair I ever did have can't say
I think that length on me is great um
cool bikini though
oh they're off to see the Wizard 13
pupils from the caution school are
hoping to star on the next Harry Potter
film after being chosen as extras for
the movie Here I am looking ever so
awkward who else is in there this was
the guy that like everyone fancied in a
school Tom if you're watching awkward me
and Joe at the model village this was
where I dressed myself um
cool hat on holiday yes Ben mmm this is
like one of my favorite pictures of me
and Joe look look how cute Joe looks in
that like he literally looks like a
little munchkin so cute what happened
what happened to us there's a little
mini Zoey to grips either side of the
hair yep oh my god who remembers this
book it was called girls under pressure
by Jacqueline Wilson I was like the
biggest book nerd ever when I was
younger I was having this conversation
with Alfie's family on holiday because
while we were there I wrote two books
and I do read really quickly I used to
read I just basically always have my
nose in a book and then I got to an age
where I just thought reading was uncool
and I wish I hadn't ever gotten to that
age um it was kind of when I was when I
started secondary school I think
but I read so many of the Jacqueline
Wilson books they were my absolute
favorite another awful hat what is it
with the awful hats
hmm
God the wines not mine so you know this
is the cat we fostered oh my god it was
the cutest thing ever
someone dumped a cat outside our house
because I didn't want it anymore and it
was hanging around outside our house and
we were like why would this cat go home
we don't we didn't know it's been dumped
and then eventually when it wouldn't go
we were like clearly this cat is not
lost it's been left so we fostered it
until we found a good home because we
lived on a main road and it wouldn't
have been safe to keep the cat but it
was so sad giving it giving it away so
I've just filmed my product video which
um you will have already seen yesterday
but it was very exciting I talked about
many products and I've got my camera on
a tripod that I need to take off there

three mark as you're watching this there
are four three days left
Trek stock now we're gonna do a live
show at some point maybe we're doing
tomorrow because soft my skin looks they
feel it Oh Soph
it's my old life guys it just looks like
education goes for that some paper it
doesn't we're gonna do a live show are
you holding a pad say like um wrestle
basically the charity I'm working with
Trek stock um I'm doing the prize EO
page on it I've mentioned it before in a
vlog it's coming to an end
very soon in like three days and we are
only five thousand dollars away four
days to go four days three days right
now and I think we can do this guy's
every single person that's watching
right now stop what you're doing click
on the link in the description box I'll
make it the top line in the description
box
it's a watching this gave like 10 P then
we would make it life a million people
watch listen you gave one pound or $1
each would raise like a million pounds
and we're asking for but it's one of
those things that's like people will
watch this
but will they click the link and donate
that's the thing anything I donated a
thousand dollars you did how we did
donate a thousand dollars
I just I really really want to help this
charity guys I really like the work they
do they don't just work with people who
are suffering with cancer but they also
really focus on support after cancer so
how kind of people continue their lives
and how it's affected them and that's
also just as important and I think it
gets missed quite a lot whether that's
someone that someone's lost to cancer or
whether they've been through cancer
themselves so I feel really passionately
about it and we're so close to the goal
I really really think that we can do
this as team Internet we can do this is
that a mark on my header on the screen
it's on the screen I was like wow this
whole time I've had a massive piece of
dirt on my head and think how much that
is that's $50,000 that's a good job now
credible and also a massive thank you to
everyone who's donated so far I shared
it confident it yeah yeah um that is a
lot of money and we've done that
together so I'm super proud of everyone
that's donated send me a little
screenshot on Twitter if you do so I can
see I'm always scrolling through my
Twitter so it'll never go unnoticed and
you're making a huge difference to
someone else's life and that is what is
most important and as I always like to
say do something good every day for
someone else because that makes someone
else feel good and also makes you feel
good for doing something for someone so

this your good deed there we go I've got
a headache
