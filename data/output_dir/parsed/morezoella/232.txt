good morning I wanted to film today
because there is something about
vlogging that I really really miss I
think daily vlogs and vlogs are
definitely my favorites to watch and
film as well I love filming them it's
just that kind of like the pressure of
doing it every day
I can't cope with I'm just like oh no if
I miss a day I've just I failed so I'm
not going to daily vlog I'm just gonna
vlog as and when and if that's seven
days of one week and two days or another
week then that's I mean I'm just just
have no expectations basically and then
we're all good I really like it when
it's just cash you know and there's like
no pressures for anything and it's just
fun I just find vlogging fun like so
much fun
don't get me wrong I love to sit down
videos as well but they're so different
you know there's like more structure to
those and it's less casual and I'm a
very casual person so for me this kind
of works really well and I watch Alfie
doing it every day and I watch our and
Jonathan doing it every day and I'm I
just have so much respect for them doing
that I mean Anna doesn't have been doing
it every day for like five six years so
I mean yeah so I want your film today
and maybe tomorrow maybe the next day
but who knows you know well we'll see
how it goes well we'll just it will be
casual and just really relaxed and if I
feel my film and if I don't I don't
loving this kind of spot thing here it's
not really a spot it's like a mark
that's kind of just dry it's a really
annoying anyway I also have a cold sore
which happens when I'm either about to
get ill or instead of getting ill I will
get a cold sore so annoying I don't know
if any of you have that um but I never
used to get them until like two years
ago and now it's like oh I think you're
starting to get a bit ill here you go

the pavilion Gardens and it is so warm
today I absolutely love this weather
look at all the pretty gaffer deals and

the pavillion looks so cool today I've
never actually been inside the Brazilian
but apparently it's quite nice
can I see six that's where we did how
much he fessed in there how much she
gets broken do you like that now no hey
it's so there's so strange noises coming
from line I'm not sure where that's
coming from
sounds like someone's having sex she is
but obviously is are what's happening
I'll be space what was why's that going
wrong is it someone inside the building
brother
are you enjoying your little park walk
somewhere from in a YouTube video down
there getting a good vlog in yes someone
is legit having sex somewhere and we
just don't know where in the hero
biggest are top of the roof up there you
think it's on the roof someone who works
in the museum and art gallery it's gone
on their lunch break I thought we could
walk around the whole building at the
park it's all luck
nuke it knowledge she's all tired now
after I walk I'm I've just picked up
some flowers for Alfie's mum please one
prettier a they can't see them look how
pretty they are so we just picked these
up from the flower shop we're ghosts
gonna stop in to Alfie's mums now and
say hello Lucy buzz and see buzz no no
no II buzz do nnessee buzz ah
shall we go see buzz good look at you do
hi buzz
yeah I think they look so different now
look at them and I'm actually saying
with them together like they do look
really similar so I got cold so I put my
dressing gown on because Alfie had left
the door open all afternoon so that's
good um I was just catching up on some
YouTube and I was watching my
a-amazing friend Casper Lee's new video
called I need your help
so last balloon was 40 I love when my
battery runs out as I'm trying to talk
about something really nice so as I was
saying my friend Caspar Lee there he is
he went to Uganda and he went there for
comic relief otherwise known as Red Nose
Day let me just check I'm in focus
dodgy lighting but imma focus um and he
wants to raise twenty one thousand
pounds for comic relief before his 21st
birthday um so I have just donated um
and I am going to leave the link in the
description of this video so that you
guys can go and donate it doesn't have
to be a lot you can literally donate to
pound 50 but that is actually enough to
make a huge difference to a lot of
people's lives who really need it so his
video was amazing I'll leave that in the
description so you can go and check that
out
but yeah give anything you can or if you
can't give anything as Casper said share
it with someone who can because this
world is a massive place and word of
mouth especially through social media
goes very quickly goes very quickly
spreads very quickly so if you can't
donate then someone else will be able to
if you share video you don't do anything
none will see it no more donate I also
just want to point you in the direction
of the playlist that I've made it's
called dance like nobody's watching and
there are currently 115 songs almost 7
hours of music a lot of songs that kind
of make you want to get up dance and get
you in the right mood I actually like to
listen to this in the morning to get me
started for the day it does have some
pretty good songs on it
I mean panic at the disco sit tight I'm
gonna need you to keep time come on just
tap to snap your fingers for me don't
know the words and I thought I did guess
I haven't listened to this since I was
about 16
15 16 year-old Zoe this was her jam
buttons my pussycat dolls are yeah I'm
just like picking my seat
where we going to the gym which is so
like us we're going to the gym it was
your idea
well me now if you decided about how
many weeks ago four or five weeks ago
yeah when you bought your weight you
thought any bedroom lights off it and me
and Alfie decided a while ago that we
were going to start going to the gym I
don't need to lose weight
necessarily I don't think um but I was
very dark but I do know that exercise is
good when you have anxiety and a lot of
people tell me this all the time and
they're like you do exercise though
right and I'm like yeah no and so I
bought some gear some tracksuit some
little trainers little sports bra thingy
and I was like right we'll start going
to the gym because alfea's been going
with his friend for a while anyway
like yeah I'll just come with you I do
some squats and lunges try and get a
Kardashian booty or something just as
something to kind of get my heart racing
a little bit do a little bit of exercise
and I just haven't been yet just haven't
been because I don't know Jim scare me a
little bit because they're full of
people that are like yeah Jim
I don't know but yeah I don't need a gym
bag what would you do back for do you
not just go with like keys in a phone
and that's it I don't know I don't know
the gym etiquette I'm not going to go on
huh you've got your gym bottle I do you
actually have one of those is it I don't
take that lightly I'm not gonna need

on a beach in is really nice and fun
yeah just watching your video
okay
this made me laugh this is Marcus and
Miami's vending machine or some nice
healthy things in there this is my idea
of the perfect vending machine or the
English I survived the gym we were there
for like an hour maybe maybe less than
that I don't really know um and I did
some legs and ah what did I do the thing
where you go like this I don't even know
the names of any of it it was it was fun
it was fun actually and I should do that
more often to be honest it's kind of
just healthy isn't it it's just healthy
to do things like that push yourself a
little bit but I'm going to end this
vlog here I think got my posted gym mini
eggs and I'm not actually eating those
but they are next to my bed so if I do
get peckish it's like my emergency stash
yeah I think I'm gonna have a shower and
then get into bed and what's the time
it's like way past my bedtime
oh I just dropped my phone on the floor
I think it's like quarter past 10:00
yeah I'm normally asleep by now I wish I
was joking too but I'm not so I hope you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
