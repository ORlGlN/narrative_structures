saw the sky clear up and we are going to
go fly the drone over the river
Austin River I think it's called I think
it's called it's the fine river because
it's a river it's called the river we
couldn't get the drone to work all
within because of a firmware issue and
it needed a PC to update that guys
driving drunk and I snapchat it got I
need some help because I need a PC if
anyone's on South Congress who had a PC
and Michelle a dink Famer came with her
PC and completely saved the day and
fixed our drone hashtag cheers on
Twitter Thank You Michelle huge huge
help so we're going to go fly the Mavic
and then we're going to meet the rest of
the guys the Midland guys for dinner and
I'm literally just going to get so out
of my mind obliterated
that there'll be nothing I will be a
drone by the end of the night I will
just fly my trigger word as a drone is
it's fine
so if I hear that I'm just gonna crash
finally Oh No
shut up no no hurry up
hey I got a drinking problem your gas
cap is open its open its up it's open
hey to far it's not working dude
we're meeting long about the Vice yet
did we telling what nothing nothing
happened tell when I'm gonna fight well
we like as rim bikes it was like I did
so we rented bikes and we paid for what
we thought was 24-hour pass it wasn't
apparently that's a lie
and you have to park them back in the
city bike club we did not and we woke up
to an $80 charge each which was cool so
we spent almost as much more than what
our rental car costs actually we did
together the total cost was more than
rental cars so that was I'm it's Austin
City bike so if you living off and you
know what we're talking about but so I
got a call from them this morning and
they were like hey so you saw the 160
dollar charge on your account right you
like you didn't do that by accident I
was like actually we thought we had it
for 24 hours we made a mistake we locked
him up overnight and didn't return him
and she was like oh it's okay I'll waive
the charge Camille from Austin City Bike
save the day and waved our entire charge
which was dope as fuck because we rode
them for like an hour and be paid to
ride them for like three weeks I just
realized that this trip we've been saved
now several times by people so I'm not
really sure what has what would have
happened without them like we somehow
facilitated help how did we get help
with everything what we were our jobs
yeah we did our jobs but we couldn't do
it alone we needed help
that's good good Nick
gazebo to processor
okay that seemed all dry

kind of deserved it to be fair and to be
unfair also you're like yelled at me you
