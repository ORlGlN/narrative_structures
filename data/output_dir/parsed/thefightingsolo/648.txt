hey guys what's up its Julian here I
just wanted to show you that I can
deadlift just a little bit more than
Hugh Jackman or some of you might know
him as Wolverine he posted a video the
other day and it got posted to Reddit so
I wanted to challenge myself today the
gym with some deadlifts and I did so
you'll see that and I also said a couple
of personal records on Queens I feel
like I needed a new level today so I'm
proud of that I just want to share this
with you guys for those of that I care
