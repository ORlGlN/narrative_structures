really long time today we're going over
to the Gentle Barn in Los Angeles do you

that you can pay entry to to go pet all
of the animals on the barn livestock

really wanted to do this for a long time
to like meet some cows pet them and pigs
and I've literally never done that ever
so I'm terribly excited
Debbie machine is coming over and we're
going to carpool over there and go see
some wonderful little creatures I read

the rest of the animals here like a
chickens the turkeys the goats and its
really nice we we just have the
presentation where and kind of explain
what the Gentle Barn is which I honestly
didn't know it's basically like a rescue
for animals who have either like escaped
slaughterhouses have been rescued from
different bad situations like abusive
situations so they kind of created this
really peaceful environment for these
animals
and they use a lot of these animals to
help with a lot of different things like
they'll have you know kids use these
animals for therapy which i think is
really really fantastic
they have three locations now and it's
growing which makes me really happy this
is like a super happy happy place and
