hello I wanted to make a video to let
you know what I'm up to
because I'm up to some cool stuff and
making a kind of regular vlog of it it's
a little difficult somewhere our last
minute trips it's hard to kind of vlog
while we're shooting an episode we are
out here in freezing cold Minneapolis
shooting a big collaborative episode
leading up to tonight which was super
Saturday night and I was thinking that
there's been some cool stuff going on so
this was just a tiny little peek of what
we've been doing I hope you enjoyed it
and get some sort of excitement inside
of you about this full episode that
comes out on Friday and yeah that's it I
gotta go
