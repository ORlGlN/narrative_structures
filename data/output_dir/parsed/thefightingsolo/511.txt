what's up guys i'm here with my friend
Colin and we just shot a whiskey thing
where I sit down and have a whiskey with
someone and chat sort of like a short
version of the podcast but in a man way
and it's on my second channel so you can
click there to watch it because it was
fun it's right there right there right
there right in between us it's
separating there you go there you go so
the reason Colin is even here is because
he texted me and said we should do that
speech jammer thing because there was a
video on the internet everywhere a
couple weeks ago where his kid tried to
read dr. Seuss while he's wearing a
speech jammer which is basically a
device that plays your voice back at a
slower rate while you speak so it really
messes you up so we are already one deep
we figured we keep gone and mess with
the speech keep it loose mess with the
speech so we've literally never even
tried it
we both intentionally refrain from using
it so we can like that or not I've never
used this before okay so only seen them
used before we both and we we had a
conversation yeah Dolph up up I like
with two speech errors well let's just
try one to forgive another parent handle
sorry I got one in my car start jamming
speech start jamming oh my god it says
start Wawa oh my god this was moist dry
sound whenever ridiculous shut up okay
this is this is sure can you give it
what can you get can you hear me
yeah but what even if I'm talking like
I'm talking on Los Angeles we're gonna
call somebody I can hear you but I can
also okay again I don't even you know
it's fucking scary yeah it feels like
you don't know I kind of feel like I
have it on arts school like a lasting
effect don't forget how to talk well
