what we should do is fly the drum since
they told us we couldn't fly the drone
at that guy's house we should just fly
it now into his house like literally
into the living room I took one of his
cards yeah I took one of his business
cards that was the first time I've ever
been in someone like and they have
business cards sitting on the dining
room table also we asked for a plate to
eat lunch and the guy told us the plates
are from 1973 I said hey man can what
plate should I use and just like that
it's super awkward and he said oh this
one these are from 1973 1973 Collin how
dare you get his plate year wrong in a
typical size mattress
