I wonder whether enough time to explain
all the peach gets a bunch of food and
puts it in her mouth and takes it in
here and then left it all out so she can
eat in the room with us
I'll show you girl are you a pelican so
depending on how hungry she is sure
bored more food she's going back for
more so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to call her so she comes up on the
couch cuz she does really fine here
funnier when she goes up here and like
brings up lunch and then just like left
audible chops she did that earlier
Pete are you hoarding food
are you a pelican he's so for like oh
girl I know you are you dude you were
right for more fun it's just funny how
much I relate to that
impulsive wanting to eat like where the
fun is
instead of just be by yourself the way
you eat is very cute meat you can off
your off do something about that excuse
you
thank you get off on top of the bed good
job your leg okay
is that fun
yeah this is so cool
and good morning is now Monday I
received the bachelor pin as you can see
they were on my hat these are the pins
that I'm dropping to day it's fine the
pin collection five different designs
and colorways it is going live right
this moment so if you're watching this
vlog right now they are locked the link
is in the description the link is on
screen there will potentially be restock
on these pins but I'll have to see later
very excited with these pins we worked
for a while on making these look right
we wanted it to look sort of like a neon
sign that was the idea that was the
theme and I'm crazy happy with how free
radicals executed and we made it happen
