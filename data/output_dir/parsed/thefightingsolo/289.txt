so our neighborhood Facebook page just
got a post saying there's a lab walking
around somewhere in the neighborhood so
Jen and I grabbed our flashlights and
we're out looking for them I think this
dog has actually left its house before
and wander around the neighborhood but
we're just we're out here looking so
hopefully we can find them
yeah
all right we're going to grab the car
and try to cover some better ground
I'm going back to get the car now and
we'll
so
right kitty turban all over so yeah why
not we have little ones too I would be
devastated so okay yeah we'll be here
we'll wait yeah awesome
hey of course any time yay great Leigh's
inside oh all right so we found out
where Gridley is squigglies back at home
we just met up with the neighbors who
put the post up and they knocked on the
door and heard the park she's not bad
yeah greatly snuck out and I reckon
naughty Gridley thing that makes it feel
so much yeah I was getting I was getting
that sinking feeling when I'm sleeping
knowing that there's a dog we're all
right I'm in my car right now cuz we are
gonna go for a little night ride all the
way across town to get some hopefully
get some cupcakes but we also have to
podcast tonight so we figured it'd be a
good time to try the car cast so what I
have here is my normal camera mount
right there and then trying to figure
out the audio situation see this is yet
another time where we need love mics
although ours aren't here yet so I'm
trying to mount both of these mics like
what am I supposed to do here this is
going to put this mic somewhere world
get me could this work this might work
this actually might work better oh yeah
I think this is good so for that putting
it up here let's try that for Jenna
so that the mics up here right here and
that should provide decent audio I mean
it's obviously not gonna be ideal audio
let's get the shock mount on so it
shouldn't be horrible this is gonna be
fun we beach beach beach beach equally
