you're going to have such a good time
well Kermit likes it cause he's the most
social yes like everytime Marvel's are
to day care we always find out that he's
being held the majority of the time
because he'll he like attaches to the
person really goes like this they pick
him up like every time I take my blood
from day care he's just being held from
where tradition you always get treated
so special at day care huh I remember
years ago when I first got marble
evaluated for day care I was like
there's no way that they're gonna let
him cuz she's just like Maxie he barks
like he was only good after a while and
they came back like after a half hour or
whatever Lily he's fine I'm like she's
fine in this period
