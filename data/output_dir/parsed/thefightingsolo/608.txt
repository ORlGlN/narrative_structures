hey guys but so I just woke up right now
you know I came downstairs to give
little peachy here her medicine and I
was like it's one of those little
syringes that you like shooting the
mouth there's not a needle it's just
like just a syringe and I shot it and
she's like dealing with the taste and
then out into her cone cuz she was
wearing her cone pops a tooth
she just like casually lost another
tooth she didn't seem to have any pain
or blood so yeah that was pretty wild I
did not expect that to happen but I took
her collar off just so she could like
breathe a little bit she's not wearing
it for almost a week so hopefully it'll
be off for good soon but she's being a
real pill she won't go pee inside and
it's like hot it's not even cold all
right Jenna's still asleep so when she
gets up I guess we'll figure out what
we're doing today but uh yeah I just
want to show it with you okay I just put
her cone back on this is what she's
doing we have such special children he's
not good Kota
PG naughty selfish selfish I get is
caught on my forehead

crying in the cars we got here like when
we're arriving at a destination we're
about to like they know that we're going
to get there so they start freaking out

they sound like little chimps but
probably just walk around for a little
bit enjoy the view and get them outside
get them tired and then also we're doing
later probable you look so ridiculous in
a onesie he's like trying to attack the
birds this three-pound dog in a onesie
