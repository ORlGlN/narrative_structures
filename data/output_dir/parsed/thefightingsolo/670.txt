all right so my mom decided we should
come up the back side of the hill where
nobody is right mom yeah if she decided
that would be a good idea and as we were
coming up I said this looks like I and
she's like no it's fine
so then we go down and I slip and my
skis come off I only have one now
and the other ones down there I don't
know if you can see it I'm gonna go
slide down to it right now check this
out
oh yeah
this is not safe at all
all right and there's this key I
probably slid like a hundred yards
between those two slides and that's
Robin in hell this is all my mom's fault
what is this brutal anyway in case
you're on the fence about skiing this
should convince you
