get some snacks and we never take
marbles that we only take the eggies
like on solo adventures so we took
marbles left for 5 maybe 10 minutes came
back and peach had lost her mind she
ripped a hole in the pillow like she
doesn't rip the stuffing out of pillows
anymore and even when she did she would
unzip them with her mouth and then take
the stuffing out this time she ripped it
up an entire hole in the pillow and went
party in the house like things she
doesn't really do because we took out
like her pack leader boyfriend dad

amount of time I've never seen her lose
