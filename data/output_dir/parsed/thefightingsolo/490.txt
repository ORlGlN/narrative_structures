credible driver here now thought she's
not a good driver at home but she just
like jumped in the rental car and she
just automatically turned into life it's
very different phone look confronting

into these relationships and keeping a
mystery see at this rate I ain't gonna

all that makes toys fabrics are there's
a gold stream which years ago there's a
star market cheese to go and then of
course behind us the Dunkin Donuts so

stomping ground so cool Cambridge so we
were getting ready to go up with a knife
and we found an entrance to the roof so
that's where I go right now

wide open and there's no signs up here
Jenna's friend just got here right now
so we're going to go out and

had a blast last night as you probably
saw a little bit of so yeah gotta find
something to donate oh it's beautiful in
Boston right now

sports bar so now that Duncan's right

is we're going to get like a $200 don't
get your gift card to donate which is
like probably the most awesome thing
ever so yeah that's it I'm going to get
coffee but let you know that president
