what is up guys uh right now it's
Saturday night you just pull this up a
little bit and given that we kind of
went hard last night
uh we're we're kind of just chilling out
tonight that right lady what are you
doing are you doing we're just kind of
chilling out tonight we finally got the
smoker working I'm so excited
Trager made it right they are awesome by
the way they basically says the right
piece and I have it working out so we
smoked on it last night I had some
chicken and it was wonderful and we made
like these vegan scout's potatoes on it
and it was incredible that's the jazz
music we listen to all we cook tonight I
am making some chicken wings might have
them sitting aside right now I put a rub
on them I'll show you guys and Jen is
making a vegan smoked mac and cheese
which should be really really humming ah
let's go on the chicken Wow
that's where my lines at let's go in the
kitchen and see what we got going there
are you sad little girl
smoked vegan mac and cheese last time
did you show them the smoked scallop
potatoes no I ain't shown I still do be
leftovers yeah yeah so we were very very
proud last night we made these um it
smoked like scalloped potatoes but we
didn't know if I was gonna work with
almond milk and the day a cheese and
like vegan butter and stuff and we had
to cook it for a lot longer like we
wanted cooking it for hours because it
tails I'll tell you through yeah but I
did end up working in it's
delicious it really is it's a it's a
creamy and the potatoes are soft it's
really taste like scalloped potatoes
except it's like vegan cheese and it
doesn't make you feel should you eat it
don't need to take a nap after yeah
that's right so we're going with the
same sort of theme like vegan starch
with some cheese everywhere
tonight we are making um like a smoked
macaroni and cheese so we're gonna do
sorry the same thing that I'll show you
the sauce smells oh yeah for rubbed
right now with the whole
vegan mac and cheese sauce but we got to
keep it shut
we got to keep the grill shot because
when we open it it drops temperature
really fast so anytime you're adding or
taking some out you guys do really quick
with the smoker that that's just like
cream cheese and milk and butter and
like dry mustard and pepper it's really
cool cuz it smokes the sauce like it mix
it up and it cooks it so it mix it with
the pasta and cheese yeah so the smoker
is very similar to a slow cooker in that
it takes out a lot of the legwork of
cooking you just kind of throw it on the
smoker and it does its thing I'm
terribly and makes everything delicious
I'm terribly excited to try my chicken
wings and eat them all to the face if
anyone out there that eats vegetables
like me and you love your vegetables
I was so of sex am I gonna smoke meat
but I'm like emotional all my vegetables
we just put like chili powder and pepper
like a little tiny bit of seasoning I
barely any last night and it tasted so
good and it was my guy I love zucchini
so much without some of my thinking on
so yeah it just it just like
infuses a very very cool
also it's 8 o'clock it's 8 o'clock
powerful we got Powerball ticket peach
you be a naughty easy calm come
downstairs currently doing man years are
weird
what is it okay nope
we got like nothing no but I thought
we're gonna win isn't it only like one
two hundred ninety two point two million
we got that we got the Powerball number
in one of them yeah this is too many
numbers to look at are they supposed to
be in order
yeah if you guys want to know our
thoughts on the Powerball we talked
about on the podcast so check that out
I'm not gonna like explain that here but
it's just for fun yeah well we lost what
do we do with our lives now we
are I guess we just got to keep on
living I keep the same numbers yeah it's
way to be numbers at all so we're
about halfway done with the wings I just
flip them over and they're looking
really good I'll go show you in a sec
but we're getting closer and closer to
eating and I'm really excited because
never had smoked mac and cheese ever
made my own wings at least on a smoker
up datum I think once but think about
that great check out the wings
looking like right now looking real good
so that's how they're looking right now
you can tell the flavor is just getting
like literally smoked in there
so I'm really pumped when I used to go
to this Whole Foods in Venice California
there was this smoker section in that
Whole Foods and it was specific to that
hopeless that they made these wings that
I'm trying to recreate they were smoker
wings and they just so delicious like
perfect and when I first got the smoker
that was one of the first things so it's
like smoking that was like one of the
first things I want to recreate so
hopefully we'll get a less step closer
to do that tonight
how's this costume okay we're just
trying to like problem-solve a little
because with the potatoes we had to
drain a lot of we had a dream out of the
liquid because all the melting is really
water you so we're thinking maybe we try
and boil it down a little bit it might
get a little bit thicker so I'm not
draining less water at the end yeah
looks really tasty so far yeah so we're
going to put the pasta in here and mix
it with the cheese and then form
and then we'll be damned right before
the smoker this is what it looks like
I'm glad that we boiled down the sauce
and stuff because it definitely helped
thicker and sticking and yeah you want
some extra bread crumbs hell yeah you
like the right girl okay yeah
and here they are these are my chicken
wings they're looking and smelling
exactly as I'd hoped
so hopefully they will taste the same
so this is the best thing I've ever made
it's so good I told them that I was
trying to replicate the smoker wings
from Whole Foods that I used to get I
mean they're the same yeah I like create
a rub of spices just off the cup and
turned out awesome guys but I'm gonna
eat a good amount for dinner and I'm
really excited look at that oh pretty
thank you the smoker this is uh my plate
of dinner right now how about our
romantic dinner it's a soul mate eh this
is I keep like I haven't tasted eggs it
looks eyes over my mouth but like it
looks like it came out how it tastes
good yeah smoked mac and cheese mm-hmm
we're gonna eat now all right guys so um
we uh we just had to make some crepes
tonight like late-night crepes and I
found this recipe I made a bunch of
crepes
they're all really small like crepe size
and then we had a little bit left that
was like two or three crepe amounts but
only wanted one crepe so I made Ultra
crepe it looks like a burrito I can't
believe I actually did it like it filled
up the whole pan I use two spatulas it
was pretty magical I'm gonna dig into
this ultra crap right now a little Ultra
crepe action USA it was like cheese and
turkey bacon pretty simple this is what
you signed up for ultra cred all right
