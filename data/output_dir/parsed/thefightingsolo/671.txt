that's enough enough so I had initially
put up a couple videos actually that
featured weight lifting
specifically me weight lifting I'll
bring my camera to the gym and I'll just
film some of the normal lifts and some
of the workouts that I do and I put it
in a couple vlogs and a lot of you
commented and tweeted at me saying you
want to see a workout video so I decided
to make this video to help you modify
workouts to do at home
so I went to the gym throw a lot of
stuff and then I did a modified version
of most of the stuff that into the gym
so I hope you guys can't get something
out of this whether it's a laugh or a
new way so we're not a workout at home
with what you got making do with what
you got if you have dogs
those are dumbbells lift all the dogs
calm
so some of the stuff that I do in this
video you can actually do and get sort
of fit from it if you absolutely have no
access to a gym and you just want to
workout at home and some of it's pretty
 goofy but I guess you can do
that stuff too just be safe don't like
lift the couch up and let your dog run
under alright I'll see you guys next
week please subscribe thank you and let
me know how this works out
you
