Hey so today I want to make a video
about something that's really simple
that a lot of people have to do on
basically an everyday basis and that is
meeting people everyone's done it you've
had to meet someone whether it's at work
or a friend of a friend or just casually
running into another person and I want
to make a video about this because I
feel like no matter how hard I stress
trying to remember someone's name
I would always struggle because I feel
like there's so much that goes into
meeting a person in terms of just the
physical meet you know it sounds simple
it seems simple but then you go up and
you have to shake their hand you have to
make eye contact you have to say your
name pay attention and like when you
walk away you know either it's a pretty
girl in your mind you're like oh that
girl was pretty what the fuck was her
name I didn't even hear what she said or
you were struggling so hard on
remembering what you had to say and it
just all becomes so complicated so fast
I feel like every time I need someone
that I want to remember their name this
is what happens
nice day out yeah dude
from around here uh no but I work across
the street there
Oh at that restaurant yeah cool yeah I
mean Franklin chutney the one
I gotta get back it's nice to meet you
Jenna Jenna Julian she's - Julian's nice

all right cilia hi
if you struggle just like me at
remembering people's names when meeting
them like normal human beings I came up
with a couple of things to help you meet
people successfully and walk away
remembering that person's name these
ways aren't really normal but hey if you
got their name I guess you have the job
done right also I want to say a big
