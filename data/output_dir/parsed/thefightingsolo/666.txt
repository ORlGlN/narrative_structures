all right so jenna is in the other room
watching TV and it's like 2:00 a.m. and
it's officially april fools
so Kermit's been like taking craps on
the floor lately because he's like me
stressed so I want to take I have some
leftover ice cream I'm gonna mix it with
some peanut butter and I'm gonna put on
the floor and I'm gonna tell her to come
look at it because it looks like she's
probably sick or something so I come
looking on beholding it and then she's
gonna come up and I'm gonna get just
like really close and smell and then I'm
just gonna take a bite of it and see
like how should I so that's what's gonna
happen
that's nice
