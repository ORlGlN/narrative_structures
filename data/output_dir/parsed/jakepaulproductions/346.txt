Hey did you know about this
-No I didn't, I didn't.
-I thought we were friends
I didn't! I didn't know about it!
*intro slam*
*intro music*
Good morning Jack Paulers! What is popping?
Starting the vlog a little bit early right now
Becauaaase, this morning
Erica asked me if she could go up onto my roof to tan
Because it's such a nice day out
And then we were talking
And we were like "Yo what do we want to do today"
And then they were like "Oh isn't Erica on the roof tanning"
And we've like thrown water on people tanning at our house before
So, we had this really big bucket
-Giant
-Giant bucket
So we're going to take it up this ladder somehow
I don't know how we're going to get up the ladder to be honest
But once we're up there,
It should be like hilarious
-Yeah 'cause she like jams music when she's up there
Yeah, so it's like she's not even gonna hear it
Look at it
I don't know how we're going to get
The big bucket of water up here
 But look- look, look
 It's literally perfect
crazy
Let's fill up the water
Don't vlog and ladder kids
Also Jake Paulers,
I hope you have a great day today
You guys are awesome, work hard
Smile, and don't let anyone tell you you can't do things because you can.
Follow your dreams
And let's do this thang.
Yo, she's gonna be so mad at us.
-Dude, she's gonna be so pissed
Especially like, you purposely put cold water in that like
Nobody's safe.
Prank wars, is lit.
I like just climbed up the ladder though
And I don't know how we're going to get it up there
-Someone's going to have to hold it from the bottom
-It's going to be like a train type thing
*crickets*
Ohh it's heavy!
Do you want to go first up?
-I think Caid goes first up
-Yeah
Then we'll try and carry it up
As quietly as possible
-Yeah
She had her headphones on but
-Did she hear you when you went up there to check her out
-No, HAHAHAHA
She's like jamming
Raindrops
I had a virus on my pc without knowing!  -Yeah i had that last night when streaming call of duty black ops 3
-It's going to be a little more than a rain drop
Alright guys I'm about to go up first
*climbing*
This thing is so heavy, how are they going to do this?
-There we go.
-Yeah, like let go.
Yeah, that's it.
*whispering* So sketchy
*still whispering*
Her head is facing this way so
We gotta move back
*whispers*
Chair
*still whispering*
Jake Paulers it's every day bro
*even more suspense*
There it goooes!!!
*huge scream*
Are you guys *censor* serious?
Where we go?
Where are we going?
You guys! My phone is right there!
-It's a seven!
-No
-No it's not!
-It's a seven!
-No it's not!
-Hey, did you know about this?
-No, I didn't-
I thought we were friends
I didn't know about this, I'm just a filmer
I'm just a filmer!
Your phone's waterproof!
Not it's not!
Yeah it is, it's a seven.
-No it's not.
-Sevens are waterproof, right?
I swear to god, I'm gonna kill all of you while you're sleeping.
I lock my door at night.
-I made the corridor your door.
-Ok
Well, that puts me in a bad position
*sounds of Erica fighting off the boys*
Get the weapon!
I got the weapon!
Now she can't do anything.
Now she's just a girl in a bikini, she's still very dangerous
No, no, it's over!
You'll just have to get us back another day!
Bye Erica!
Bye!
