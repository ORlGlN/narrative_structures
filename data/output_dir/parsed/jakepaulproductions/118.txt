Announcer:
 Last season on "Fight
 of the Living Dead"...
 10 celebrity participants
 were taken
 to an abandoned hospital
 to face an epic challenge:
 survive a zombie
 apocalypse.
( growling )
Announcer:
 Under the watchful eye
 of the mysterious ConOp,
 they were forced
 to fight the undead,
 outsmart their captors,
 and work as a team.
( growls )
Announcer: This season,
 another crop of stars
 faces an even more
 terrifying scenario...
( hisses )
 as ConOp initiates a new
 experiment, necrotic bioforms,
 at a music festival,
 where the undead are the
 headliners.
No, no, no!
( screams )
Announcer:
 Follow ConOps rules
 and help them defeat
 the mysterious Branch 4
 or side with the rebellion
 to take them down.
- Get the key! Get the key!
- ( growls )
( screams )
P.A.:
 Welcome to Paradise Calls,
 where the only prize
 is survival.
Man:
We're screwed.
- ( growling )
- ( screaming )
- What's up?
- What's up?
All the windows
are blacked out.
This is sketchy.
You already scared?
Oh, Anwar.
Are you sure
you'll protect me?
No promises.
- ( imitates growl )
- ( laughs )
Oh, my God.
I've never been this scared,
I'm telling you.
Me and Anwar are in this
blacked out SUV car
and we have no idea
where we're going.
 And the car opens up
 to a VIP reception tent.
- Your photo?
- I was expecting
  zombies immediately,
or a big bag to be
pulled over my head.
I love this setup.
Like, this whole festival
setup is sick.
I love "The Walking Dead,"
I go to, like, every Coachella
event.
It's like combining
both worlds together.
( growls )
Open this door.
All right.
I know.
( growls )
Put your festival
bracelet on.
( growling )
We got to our destination
and they opened the door.
And I see the
Paradise Calls logo.
Okay, so you're
kind of terrified.
Yeah.
It was 10:00
by the time we got here,
so I knew something
was going down.
And as soon as we got here,
it got real real quick.
Oh, we're both
General Admission.
- ( both laugh )
- What are the chances?
- We're ready for you.
- Uh-oh!
( growls )
We have some wristbands
for you.
- All right.
- Okay.
We got out of the car,
started putting on
these heavy suits.
Like, we were just completely
and utterly confused and lost.
I have $100
on it's a prison.
I got 100 down that says
it's a lake house.
Paradise Calls.
Oh, shit.
And I answered.
We were just on edge,
ready to play.
 When we pulled up
 and opened the door,
 it was just a photo shoot.
Like, why did we have to be
blacked out for a photo shoot?
It didn't make sense.
Do you like my poses?
No one's safe, bro.
I had my guard up.
I was about to karate chop
some people's faces off.
I'm like, "Yo, I got this, fam.
I got this!"
( growling )
We at Paradise Calls
sincerely hope
you're enjoying your Surrender
to Fun intake process.
Please follow your escorts
to your assigned--
please follow your escorts
to your assigned areas.
I'm really nervous.
Copy you.
Let's go, kids.
So they're walking me and Anwar
out to the main stage,
 and at this point,
 I am memorizing
 all the doors and exits
to all the different buildings.
 I was expecting anything
 but a music festival.
 I really don't know what
 to expect, at this point.
P.A.:
 Please settle in at your
 assigned locations.
 The show will begin
 in five minutes.
We go into this VIP area
where these zombies are--
and they're actually zombies,
I guess, that help us.
 Can't really talk to 'em.
 They don't talk to you.
( growls )
All right, we already have some
dead people walking in.
( growling )
We got escorted
to, like, these little cages
in front of the stage.
And then we got locked in
by the guards, which was
really scary.
 And there were, like,
 zombies all around us.
We're ( bleep ).
- ( vocalizing )
- Yeah, he's ready.
Whoo!
Put me in, coach,
I'm ready.
Oh, snap.
Oh, shit.
Oh, it's not a game, bro.
First thoughts?
I feel we got this, bro.
- Like, lots of room to run.
- Not scared.
Anthony:
 Jake and I are like
 more funny characters.
We don't take
everything as serious,
but this was pretty scary,
so we were just trying
to make jokes,
make us feel
a little more comfortable.
It's like
a terrible Coachella.
I swear
that one's my grandpa.
That one?
Well, these are prime
seating for the show.
- Oh, great.
- Oh.
I see you, zombies.
I'm just excited
to enjoy this festival
with all these
lively people.
( laughs )
This is sketchy as hell.
I kind of feel safe
up here, though.
Oh, shit.
Save us, please, first!
P.A.: Thank you for
 your participation
 in Paradise Calls.
The show is about to begin.
( groaning )
So, we're up onstage.
They have taiko drummers
and dancers.
I'm not really sure
what ConOp is trying
to sell us on.
( music playing )
Wengie:
 When the show started,
 it was just me and Juanpa
like, sitting there going,
"What is happening?"
Now that you're all settled in--
settled in--
let me be the first
to welcome you to the site
of the upcoming Paradise Calls
music fest-- fest--
music festival.
A fun-filled time
featuring top artists
and cool tech.
On that note, allow me
to turn things over
to Paradise Calls'
best and brightest,
the head of our Paradise Calls
initiative, Dr. June Nada.
Welcome.
For decades, zombies have been
the subject of fear,
distrust, and bigotry.
But now, through the wonder
of technology
and the power of music,
we hope to end necrophobia
forever
and prove that ConOp-engineered
necrotic bioforms
can light the way
to a better future.
Imagine a world
where menial tasks
and manual labor
are a thing of the past.
Take my friend Bob here.
Bob is a Tasker,
a completely safe
and subservient
necrotic bioform.
Bob receives a command signal
through his viewing hardware
here,
and sees it on the screen
in front of him,
telling him
exactly what to do.
As long as Bob's eyes
are glued to that screen,
he will obey whatever
the screen commands.
I have nothing to fear.
Bob would never try
to eat my brains.
So this lady comes out 
talking about, "We've got
nothing to fear."
It's lit, whatever,
this festival's gonna be
on and poppin'.
That's-- I knew right away,
that's balony.
At ConOp,
we are at the brink
of a new world,
one where the non-living
and their undeceased friends
can collaborate
together as one.
If you don't believe me,
then take a look
at the Paradise Calls
harmony dancers.
May I?
Let's dance.
( music playing )
You are a wonderful dancer.
We get to see a little show,
do a little dance,
see the zombies party,
get krunk.
( electronic screeching )
Down.
Stay down.
( alarm blaring )
( screaming )
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, we're screwed, bro.
We're screwed.
Their systems ( bleep ) up
and all hell breaks loose.
Robotic voice:
 Emergency, emergency.
 Skypole and primary power
 offline.
- ( screaming )
- ( growling )
Okay.
( alarm continues blaring )
Here, follow me,
follow me.
Use the secret tunnel,
It'll take you to the VIP room.
You'll be safe there!
- ( growling )
- ( screams ) Come on!
Well, that's why I told you
we shoulda been doing something.
Holy Jesus Christ.
That was a jump.
( screaming )
The safe house!
Go to the safe house!
( screams )
How do we get in?
( screaming )
( alarm blaring )
I know, it was hard.
Oh, my God.
Are we the first ones in here?
So we're under the stage
and there's a maze
under the stage
and we're having
to crawl through it.
 We don't know
 where we're going
and I feel like I was way more
anxious than Anwar, nervous.
At this point, my heart rate
is up, my adrenaline is up.
I have to run.
Go, go, go.
Run, run. Run!
I didn't make you do this.
( zombie growling )
( roars )
( man screaming )
Oh, my sweet Jesus.
There's people acting weird.
Zombies start attacking us.
 Some guard hands me a key.
I got a key.
I got it.
I got it.
Back up!
 They're like,
 "Go to the VIP tent."
I'm like, "I don't know where
that is, bro.
Like, what are you
talking about?"
( screams )
I'm out of this bitch!
All I hear is "VIP tent"
and I remembered
because I memorized
where that was on the map
and we just start sprinting.
VIP room!
 I see a couple
 of my friends
 and I'm like,
 "Yo, what's good?"
And we're, like,
running from zombies, I'm like,
"Yo, what's good, man?"
Get in. Get in.
Get in.
Whoo!
Yo, what's up, guys?
Party!
Yo, this is lit.
My boy.
I'm doing good.
Wow, this is nice.
- Uh-oh, did we lock it?
- Yeah.
( growling )
What are we
supposed to do?
Where do we have--
we have to run in there?
Juanpa:
Yeah.
The zombies were literally
getting really aggressive
 and, like, we didn't know
 we were gonna get out
 'cause we didn't
 have a key to undo the lock.
 My only thought was, like,
 "I'm not dying right now.
I don't know how I'm gonna
do it, but I'm gonna survive
this part."
P.A.:
 Attention ConOp guard,
 you are authorized to issue
 key to subjects.
- ( growling )
- It's right here.
You got the key.
So we finally got the lock
off the door.
( shouting, screaming )
Oh, shit!
Aw, shit!
I just, like,
shot straight towards
the VIP tent.
( screams )
Open, open!
I was like, "Oh, please,
I don't want to die.
It's only been
like five minutes."
( door slams )
P.A.:
 Attention guests,
 before we can progress,
 your complete team must be
 accounted for in the VIP tent.
 I repeat, your complete
 team must be present
 in the VIP tent.
So there's just a bunch of chaos
happening right now.
We have-- two of
our teammates are missing.
Not getting out this way.
Something's blocking it.
Something's blocking it?
- I can't.
- Oh, my God,
  no, she's coming.
I can't.
I can't get out.
We happened to just make it
into the business center.
Everything just went crazy.
The Taskers went crazy.
They were no longer
our friends anymore.
- Some pretty
  pissed off zombies.
- Look-- ooh!
( growling )
Yeah, we're for sure dead.
Ken:
 There was no instructions.
 There was nothing in the room.
I was freaking out,
De Arra was freakin' out.
And die together?
I mean, we were just
on another level.
I think that's when everything
became real for both of us.
Where do we go, man?
We are literally stuck
in this room.
I'm just wondering,
is anybody gonna come get us?
Like, anybody?
- It's on right now.
- Shh!
Oh, snap.
This thing's on right here?
- Huh?
- It's on.
- Oh, there they are.
- There, there.
- Oh!
- Everybody?
Yeah, they're
all over there.
They're in an office.
They're in an office.
( pounding )
Oh, look at the door handle.
Oh, shit.
Oh, God.
I would not want
to be in there.
Look for the microphone.
- Is this one?
- Yeah, right here.
- This microphone?
- Yeah.
( voice echoing )
This microphone? Hello?
- Hey!
- What? Yo!
Can you hear us?
Hello, hello?
Waive your hands
if you can hear me.
- Yes, yes, here you go.
- They can hear you.
  They can hear you!
They're waiving their hands.
They're waiving their hands.
We don't know what to do.
They can't even hear us
so we gotta, like,
be showing them signals
 with our hands,
 like sign language.
It was just--
it's a hot mess.
Hold on.
I'ma talk to 'em.
Come here,
I've done this before.
You guys have
to come here.
Oh, shit.
Oh, hell, no.
- You have--
- You said we have
  to come to you.
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
- De Arra: No, how do
  we come to him?
- Run!
He said, "Run."
- V-I-P.
- Ken: VIP?
- That's right, yes!
- VIP, uh-huh, okay.
VIP tent.
VIP tent.
- Ken: Where's that?
- I don't ( bleep ) know.
- You guys are
  in the VIP tent.
- Yes.
De Arra:
He said yes.
Hey, someone try
to flag them down.
I'm gonna figure out
what's going on with these
zombies.
- Hannah: Hey!
- Here's Hannah. She's trying
  to say something to us.
Hey!
Jake has the key.
They have a key.
- Okay, I'm gonna go talk.
- Hey!
- De Arra:
  You guys have a key.
- Yeah! Yes!
Ken: What key?
We're trying to get to you guys,
but there's no way out.
I am running to you.
"I am going to run to you."
He says he's going to run to us.
Okay, okay, we're waiting.
Hurry.
I'm gonna figure out
what's going on with these
zombies.
Who wants to go?
I'm down.
Let's go, let's go.
You want to go?
All right,
let's do it, boys!
- Get behind
  the stage, let's go.
- To the right.
Behind the stage, Jake.
Behind the stage.
- Uh-oh.
- Okay, shit, shit.
Here, here, take it.
Use it. Use it here.
Move, move,
move, move, move.
- Shit.
- ( buzzes )
( mumbling )
Okay, yeah, shit, okay.
( indistinct chatter )
All right, go,
get out, get out!
( screaming )
Get back in!
Open, open, Jake!
Yo, come on!
Come on, move!
Hey, stay still.
Go!
( De Arra screaming )
Oh, they're coming,
they're coming.
- Go.
- Stay together!
Go!
( growling )
Go, go, hurry, hurry.
- Whoo!
- Jesus!
We did it!
What's up, fam!
What's good?
What's good?
- Squad.
- What's up?
We did it!
We're good.
So, we survived,
we achieved the first mission.
- And more.
- We leveled up.
- We leveled up.
- We leveled up.
We're gonna have
more speed now.
And we got warmed up
'cause now we know how
to communicate with each other.
- It's great.
- It's crazy.
- Okay.
- That was dope.
( groaning )
P.A.:
 Subjects, congratulations
 on bringing your team
 safely to the VIP tent.
 As we try to restore
 the festival,
 please turn your attention
 to a brief announcement
 from the project manager.
 You are in an extremely
 dangerous situation right now.
 Extremely dangerous
 situation right now.
 Due to an external
 terrorist attack,
 we're running on reserve power
 and our infrastructure
 is offline-- offline.
 We need your help.
 We need your help.
 Your number one goal
 should be to simply survive,
 but your only hope-- only
 hope-- is to perform missions
 to help us get our
 infrastructure back online.
 Particularly, the Skypole,
 the transmission tower
 in the middle of the village.
 Once the Skypole
 is operable,
 we can call for reinforcements
 and an extraction team
 probably within 72 hours.
 Paradise Calls' announcer
 will be reaching out to you
 with further instructions.
 But for now, make yourself
 at home. Enjoy the bungalow.
Repair the Sky Tower,
get the ( bleep ) out.
- That's easy.
- Let's go do it right now.
P.A.:
 ConOp guards are here
 to help as much as they can.
 We regret, however,
 that we cannot guarantee
 your safety
 for the rest of your stay
 at Paradise Calls.
 That said, we hope
 you enjoy your stay.
Woman #2:
 This is crazy!
Announcer:
 This season on "Fight
 of the Living Dead"...
And then
our missions started.
- I'm running.
- He's running.
Hey, run, run, run!
Run, guys!
I think they were
sending a message.
They were sending a message
that they're not playing around.
Come on!
Come on, Anwar!
- ( screams )
- Hannah, Hannah.
We figured out that Taskers
do specific things,
but if it's offline,
they go crazy.
Anwar, Anwar! Anwar!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
I notice little Nymph Girl,
she starts motioning for us.
And I'm like,
"She communicatin'.
What is going on?
What the hell?"
( growling )
What do you know
about Branch 4?
What's Branch 4?
The only thing we know
is that Branch 4
are trying
to get rid of ConOp.
Okay, what's happening?
Who do I trust now?
You can never
be chill out there.
( shouting )
We'll keep going, completing
missions, and hopefully we can
keep everybody alive.
 ( music playing )
Somebody help me!
