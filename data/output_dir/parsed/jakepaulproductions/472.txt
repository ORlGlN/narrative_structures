all right how you feeling we got talking
in front of what 15,000 people yeah I
think so
what if there's no one there I'm
whispering because people are still
signing up to be that quiet today is a
travel day going to Miami right now done
here in Alabama I want to say thank you
to the legendary chefs crew for having
us
we made an awesome video together that
when they post it I'll put the link to
been awesome here Miami we will be there
tonight I don't know what we're gonna do
but we're gonna do something epic hi
everybody
it is 855 our flights leaving at 10:00
it's like a 30-minute drive to the
airport right now
if you do the math on that it does add
up to us being almost late so we're
probably gonna have to sprint to the
airport this is the things that you go
through with the vlog life we got stuck
to dumping footage
so how many more minutes until we went
three minutes three minutes
whoa we made it to Miami it's a party no
it's probably not like Miami is like a
party place you cry at your destination

bad I'm not mad at it doing this women
uh so we're here and this is what I'm
doing in Miami it's sick oh we're
trying to figure out something fun to do
but I don't know anyone or anything or
have friends or have a face so I can't I
don't know what to do so I'm just
sitting here awkwardly on this bed and

possibly do is eat the 21-day challenge
