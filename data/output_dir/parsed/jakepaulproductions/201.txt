FELT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
I FELT SO ALONE AND SO LOST.

THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME SING THAT
DOWN HERE WITH YOU GUYS.
IT WAS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL MOMENT
FOR ME.
HOLD ON.
I AM MAKING MY WAY, TRYING NOT
TO FALL.
HERE I GO.
I'LL STAY HERE.
WE ARE HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF A
PIANO ISSUE, SO I THOUGHT I
WOULD TALK TO YOU IF THAT'S OKA
OKAY.
I AM PLAYING JEOPARDY MUSIC IN
MY HEAD.
WHEN I WROTE THAT SONG THAT I
JUST SAYING, I WAS DEFINITELY IN
MY DARKEST POINT THAT I'VE GONE
THROUGH IN MY RECENT LIFE.
DEFINITELY HAVE GONE THROUGH
SOME STRUGGLES BEFORE BUT I WAS
REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME.
I AM RELEASING MY MUSIC IN
CHAPTERS.
THAT'S WHEN I WAS ON CHAPTER
ONE, WHICH WAS BLUE.
I RODE ALL THREE OF THOSE SONGS
IN PART OF MY LIFE WHEN I WAS
REALLY LOST.
I KNOW WE ALL FEEL THAT WAY.
SOMETIMES.
CHAPTER ONE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
TO ME BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IF I
WERE YOU, IT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT
TO HEAR FROM ME.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I WOULD WANT THAT REASSURANCE.
JUST BECAUSE I AM ON STAGE
DOESN'T MEAN I
 -- I DON'T HAVE
PROBLEMS TOO.
CHAPTER TWO, RED.
I DECIDED I WASN'T GOING TO BE
MISERABLE ANYMORE.
I WOKE UP AND I WAS LIKE, YOU
KNOW, I CAN'T SAY A CURSE WORD.
I AM A LOT HAPPIER NOW, AND I
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE
STILL IN YOUR CHAPTER ONE BLUE,
YOUR CHAPTER TWO RED WILL COME.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE STILL
FIXING THIS PROBLEM.
HERE I AM TALKING TO YOU.
THE NEXT SONG I'M GOING TO SING
WAS THE FIRST SONG I WROTE WHEN
I DECIDED THAT I WASN'T GOING TO
BE SAD ANYMORE.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND I WAS
LIKE, NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO BE
MY FAN IF I'M NOT MY OWN.
YOU CAN'T RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE
TO BRING YOU OUT OF DARK TIMES.
YOU ONLY HAVE YOURSELF.
THROUGH ALL OF LIFE, YOU WILL
HAVE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND
CARE ABOUT YOU AND WILL BE THERE
FOR YOU, BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE YO
YOU.
SO SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO FORCE
YOURSELF TO LOVE YOURSELF WHEN
IT'S REALLY HARD TO.
BUT I'M ALSO NOT PREACHING TO
YOU BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FIGURED
OUT MY LIFE YET EITHER.
AND I TAKE IT DAY BY DAY AND I
STILL HAVE BAD DAYS, BUT WE ARE
GETTING THERE.
YOU KNOW?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEER FOR ME.
I AM JUST TALKING TO YOU.
NOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO
BECAUSE THAT WAS MY WHOLE SPIEL.
SORRY, GANG.
I LIED.
NEXT SONG, DIFFERENT SONG NEXT.
WE'RE GOOD.
THANKS FOR BEING PATIENT.
I'M SORRY.
I PROBABLY BORED YOU TO DEATH.
