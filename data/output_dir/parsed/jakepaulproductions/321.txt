it's really scary living yo before I
officially start the vlog like why did
we do this hey thing like look at this
mess that's created look at our yard
yeah all right back to you Jake
20 minutes lay down guys good morning
Jake boy it's pretty early
Anthony's sleeping in the car downstairs
we're gonna wake him up lotion slap
lotion slap
it's everyday
moisturize lips or anything you can do
can you rub it in and you rub me in baby
stop that okay okay
good morning game where you're always
walking in this door and like you're
baffled by like the white stuff that's
all over our bodies right now and you're
probably wondering why it's on them the
side of my leg that's good that's great
I need to go watch this guy's let's go
Lamar you Martinez money means you guys
are up early yeah oh yeah we have room
what is that English yo yeah you want to
be my vlog today yeah I just follow me
the whole day okay all right so just
yeah yeah let's go let's go okay yep
you're doing a bad job the question is
we're gonna no you tell me what we're
doing
I've got the choice up
let's cut this up transition shots with
cool genders and shots because I'm a
vlogger probably one of the sickest
transitions flash time-lapses slash
artsy shots that you've ever seen
nagging a lot Jake pause we do it the
most and we will be right back actually
though 20 minutes later yo guys guys I
need we need to go into the office
without them there what were I talking
about you guys stupid like officially
put Chancellor at the 1910 yeah okay
that's like draw it out a little bit
though cuz it's like funny it's like
funny to watch them like suffer you know
I mean I could make jokes of that yeah
and then and then eventually we'll be
like make up make it like a big thing
continue this conversation later Billy
actually though I had to pause I want
you to miss anymore
what did you I stumbled upon this this
movie trailer and this looks so sick
chuckles cool would you call Phoenix for
God was
the air force dad well open with our air
force Jade come on well bear with me the
Phoenix lights okay South East which is
exactly over headed how do I get there
this is gonna be rude what the hell why
you showing this to us go it's all come
together I'm having a great idea all at
the same time should I record or no yeah
I might just spit knowledge right now I
don't know I just embarr so this is
based off a true story which means that
theoretically some of these things may
have happened movie come out yet it's
like a new tits trailer plug in movies
like based around aliens like touching
down in this desert in Arizona what I'm
thinking is people are gonna see this
and they're gonna be like yo we got to
be the first to go there so I'm the dude
who say we got to be the first to go
there now I mean like I mean I'm down do
you have anything planned today for the
vlog realistically I mean I was gonna do
some stuff but if you want to but you
want to legit just drive the Phoenix to
the desert and see if there's UFOs there
someone's gonna someone's gonna do the
same thing I'm doing right now I'm that
great idea we gotta see it for ourselves
yeah that's what I'm saying hey you guys
have fun I'll stay here wait a second
wait a second
you said that you would stay by my side
for this whole entire vlog are you down
Marcus yeah yeah you really don't have
anything else to do it's low-key scary
whenever we do stuff like this it
actually like gets in there it's so
scary please come with us that's huh
nothing would be more to me than for you
to come with us okay that's that's it
yeah okay Tessa I mean nothing more than
me bringing you to go Tessa nothing
would mean more to me than if you would
come with us to Phoenix right now
six-hour drive that's it better get
packing fine day callers looks like
we're going to Phoenix
good driving for a while but the few up
again we're almost think like two hours
in our way yo there's no service so we
found this specific spot where we're
supposed to go where there's like
apparently more activity for the like
supernatural stuff like where they went
in the movie Oh keys get high school
tests are you scared yet it's not even
dark out we have to wait for the dark
all right so we came to this rock here
all right it's okay that we were like
gonna go out this trail but Kate it was
like looking on the drone yeah and it's
the area that we're supposed to go to
isn't this area so we're a little bit
lost I think this is the area like when
I was watching the videos youtube videos
like how to get there yeah I think this
looks a lot like it too
we'll probably have to go on foot I
think like into a little bit we leave
the truck here yeah yeah all right Jake
ballers take an hour until it gets dark
very much in the right area for the most
part we really don't know I guess yes we
just go exploring
I swear walk like the rocks in the
trailer
that's gonna be nice full moon no no
this is is very eerie yeah let's let's
chill here until it gets dark and then
explore
it's like really cold and windy they're
all like hiding in these coats
it's breezy like an eerie amount of cold
it's so cool
we're just gonna walk around and try to
find anything it's our ghost story UFOs
the minutes should be held
yes actually I don't want to be the
first to make an alien joke but it's
like in the middle of nowhere just so
random
well just like in scary movies so let's
follow the arrow
