this is clickbait
Literally everyone here is blogging
They are just like ''Were at the white house!'' IMMA SLEEP IN IT BRO! I'M SLEEPING IN IT!
My dream is to visit the White House
*Yawns*
Today. Is. The day!
It's actually a huggeeeeeee day and I have to get ready
Shower. Dressed. Almost ready for today now, Jake!
What is it that you are doing?
Why is it such a big day?
Let me tell you
So, a couple weeks ago
The White House emailed me
And they said ''Yo, Jake, we're having this event with a bunch of influencers-''
''Do you want to come and attend?''
They said:
Obama is gonna be there
Michelle Obama
Joe biden
Andddddd
You'll get to meet them
Video tape with them
All the stuff
So I was like DUH!
But, thennnnn
I was like...
What do I wanna do before I die!
And one of those things is...
Have a sleep over at the white house
So I thought why not
Vlog myself doing an overnight challenge at the White House
This is probably my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
Where I will actually be inside of the White House
Where I could go like, in to a bathroom and try and sleep overnight there and then leave in the morning
WOAHHHHHHHHHHH
WOAH
BRO WHAT IF I ACTUALLY DO THIS
Sorry, chair
I'm so sorry
Sorry about that
Jake Paulers I'm going to try my 100% hardest to do this today
I have to be there in two hours.
In the meantime, they told me to dress business attire
And me being the idiot that I am, I brought jeans.
And, like, this shirt.
so I have to go, an, and yeezys as my dress shoes
So, I have to go to the store right now.
And get some business attire clothes.
Jesus, Jake, what were you thinking?
You're going to the White House and you brought Yeezys.
GOD!
All right, Jake Paulers, let's see if we can pull this off today.
If I don't make it out of there, you won't ever know 'cus I'll probably delete this footage.
Let's go get some clothes for the White House.
All right, here at the store.
Let's see what they got for this White House attire.
I'm so bad at, like, dressing nice.
Yo, my man I need your help!
-What's that?
I'm going to the white house and I need to look fly.
What do you got for me?
You got some fire?
I feel like I need a suitjacket, right?
I think, like, black.
I was gonna wear this. Is that dumb?
All right, you guys got me?
-Yeah!
My boy.
My boys got me.
All right, so, they got the hookups. Let me see what I can do.
WOOHOOHOO!
Ya boy's kinda hot.
Hey, I'm going to cop this,
go get some lunch
and then it's White House time.
Yaaay! All dressed up. Got the 'fit.
We made it work. We pulled it together last-second.
*Agent 007 walks across the street*
