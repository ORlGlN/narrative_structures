influencers that have a lot of followers
like you do that I know or a bad buy
yeah and then I know you and a small
group are good bye because of what you
do with your attention of content is the
content the message do you align does
your brand align with that brand have
you ever had to sell somebody on doing
something with an influencer or yourself
that said to you guys well I don't
influence your marketing before it it
hasn't worked
does that come up yeah yeah all the time
and you just have to you just have to
like a face yeah either punch them in
the face or explain to them like why
