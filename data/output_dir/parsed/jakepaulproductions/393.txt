Good morning Kade.
-Mornin' Jake
-I like your shoes.
-Thanks Jake.
-Do you know where you got 'em?
- Um.... forgot
- you got 'em from me. hehe
-Slipped my mind. I don't even remember.  
-Yeah
-Alrighty let's build this thing!
-Honestly I have no idea what I'm doing. I just watched a YouTube video.
-Woo! Half way through building this. It's actually starting to turn out like really awesome.
We are gonna do this side of it now. My biggest concern is like the weight. But I feel like I know what I'm doing,
I feel like I got this, yo.
-Yo. It got so hot up there. look at this, yo. Oh, my, gosh, it's coming together!
I still don't know what I'm doing!
-This is the official test.
I think it worked, yo. I don't want our neighbors to come over here. Cause we're technically using their pole.
You hang on it,  you hang on it. alright? He's lighter.
See if you can hang there for like a couple seconds.
-Oh!
-It's good, right?
This landing zone, is like so, like minimal
Bro, it works really good.
Yo, one of you should go first.
you go first, you're lighter.
-no
-no you're lighter. Alright fine.
-Why can't you just do normal stuff instead?
-well this is more fun. How do you say, "back yard, zip line"?
- buck yahrd zip line
-Oh no!
Are you from London?
-No.
-?
-no. I'm actually originally from America.
-No you're not!
-A lie!
-Alright, so we shortened this handle because the weight, if you like pull your feet up, brings you right above the pool.
-Oh yeah. Okay.
-We are just about ready to do this. But, I'm gonna have my friend here go first. To see what happens.
-Three.
Two.
One.
 "I believe I can fly"
 -She did.
-I think it worked.
-
-Here we go!
-
-okay!
-Home made!
-Back yard zip line
-In three,
Two,
One!
Aaaah! yeah!
-No way!
-Yo ho ho!
-It was perfect!
-Oh my God! It works so well!
-Perfect!
-Yo! That went-
-Yo, high five!
-Yes!
-It was literally perfect. Did it break, or can people go? You wanna go?
-Yeah!
-Let's go!
-Yo Jake Paulers, it's everyday bro.
- hopefully our neighbors, don't come over here.
-Alright, Amelio is about to go. Yo bro, I don't know how many runs we can get out of this
cause every time you do it, it like starts to sag more. Are- are you ready?
It feels safe right?
-Three, two, one...
Go!
-Yeah?!
-Yeah!
-It's fun right?!
-it's perfect!
-You like, barely missed this, bro
-You almost didn't have a butt anymore, call him Nicki Minaj, cause that s*** is fake!
-That was SICK!
-Alright so, our zip line was only good for two runs. it broke. it's like, just kinda like sagging now.  
I'm gonna try and fix it, so that we can do it a lot more often in the vlogs.
What's next?!
