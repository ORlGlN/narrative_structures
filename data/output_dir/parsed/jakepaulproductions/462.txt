aha my head is like really all right let
me see what happens at this stage in the
caffeine intake you can survive
taking 400 milligrams of caffeine an
espresso shot has about 60 to 63 65
milligrams of caffeine so that's like
what a eight already passed a limit your
sin I don't want to tell you I really
died it's kinda I feel fine now though
that's a caffeine talking that's the
coffee zone the amount of caffeine that
you've already drinkin which is
approximately like what 500 milligrams
of caffeine yeah 600 milligrams
you should start experiencing mania and
Huson ations at this point in the
challenge during one more the better
shot all right one more this is when the
mania will cook them this will be 13
