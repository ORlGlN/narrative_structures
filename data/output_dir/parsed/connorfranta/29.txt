photographs fly down where we used to
lie down removed by the same hands that
used to hold my hands we pack them away
in cardboard capsules behind closed
doors memories stay and decay and the
grace of Queens and Kings to the land
where dreams are made now hidden in
darkness an empty row of nails lines the
wall my eyes sting with pain his White
T's stained with a cocktail of Tears we
wish to hide beside them to stowaways
capsized in the present below our melted
hearts blood drains from our veins as
the door closes one last time on
everything we used to know our eyes shut
before midnight no words break the
silence wishing for an extra hour hoping
for a better day like the ones depicted
behind the wooden frames
you
it does honey
