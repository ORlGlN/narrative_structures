today I said for the first time in a
while inside my chest I felt that they
mean it and deep in my mind what a
strange thing it is to feel a feeling
you nearly forgot existed this vessel
moving through your system like a boat
down a stream like a balloon floating
through the sky
drifting effortlessly finally found but
quickly lost in the horizon like an old
friends voice familiar and calling
it's nice to see you please do stay a
while we have some catching up to do
just you and me together again through
my bones wrapped around my heart this
sends some warmth it glows so bright and
like the Sun in the morning it's nice to
finally feel like the old me again
we stay a while
