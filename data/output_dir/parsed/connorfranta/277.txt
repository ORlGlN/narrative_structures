hey what's up you guys it's Connor and
lately I've been realizing people make a
lot of different facial expressions so
naturally I thought I'd make a video
about it you know but yeah so there's 25
different facial expressions that I know
ok here we go 3 2 1 go Sarah yeah yeah
where's the party
what is that over there
so hope you guys enjoyed the video if
you did make sure to give it a thumbs up
and leave a comment on me which one was
your favorite facial expression but
other than that I'm gonna go okay as
well I was really good I mean it's just
like my 20 fight even last one with his
idol
