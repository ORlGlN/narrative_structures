I'm a private person I'm in the business
of public disclosure and yet I keep so
much to myself it's more by choice than
happened much like most things I guess
here's the directions and decisions we
choose to take and follow blindly I'm
leaning to light others spiraling down
into the dark to pitch black ink I think
too much I feel broken at tiles could be
for my breakup
could just be for myself at work mental
health doesn't really matter it's there
this is getting dark let's open the
curtains a little bit you know I've been
in love God have I been in love like
that after punch to the gut head over
your key people only thing to talk about
I've grown into my little present-day
self by sharing everybody else but here
I sit like nobody even knows me edited
curated calculated and that normalized
laughs it really scares me
I think it's time I short my inside show
you my light and hold your hand in my
dark take you to my highest tides and
write down my lowest lows I want to show
you that person my first book a
work-in-progress was a reflection of my
external lifeless bar
this follow-up is a reflection of my
internal life right now
this is note to self
and listen to me
