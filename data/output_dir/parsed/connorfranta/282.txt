hey what's up you guys it's Connor every
sup guys it's Ricky and we're in New
York now we're in New York and while
we've been here we found on a bunch of
things you shouldn't do in the city so
we put together a list of 10 things not
to do in the city but here we go 3 2 1
nope don't draw too much attention to
yourself
don't touch random people
no matter how tired you get don't take
naps in the sidewalk
don't text her walk
don't announce important personal things
because no one cares
don't fangirl over celebrity unless you
know it's them
don't talk to strangers
don't bother being nice to people
don't eat food up the street
don't spend all your money on souvenirs
because then you'll have to resort to
street performances
well I hope you guys enjoyed the video
thank you guys for watching it was
really fun to make and by the way we
made a music video on Ricky's channel so
make sure to go click his face and
