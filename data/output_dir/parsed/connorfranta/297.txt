hey what's up you guys it's got her and
I got a fisheye lens it's super cool and
I'm in my living room and in my house so
many new things hello you've reached out
I need a tissue take that to play bitch
random swag I love that song songs have
you realized song rhymes with so many
bad words think about it have you
realized potatoes come out of the ground
think about it have you realized we all
poop think about it these are the things
I wonder what to put those birds huh
I mean they're always chirping chirping
chirping turn what's up a Twitter huh
Birds no Twitter or tweet or do they
and what's up of hair flips huh are they
really that attractive no they cause
neck injuries I could have choked on
that and died pure talent but I'm in the
hood I'll roll with gangs
I do drugs hello my name is Connor and I
am 19 years young damn straight

and a cat you ain't got nothing on me on
a scale of one to ten you're an 11 damn
girl you fine finer than a dime drinking
wine honey boo boo Paula $4 honey boo

Connor Franta and you're watching Disney
Channel why didn't it light up sheds a
tear I'm going to leave you with this
never eat the fortunes inside of the
cookies never eat the carton after you
drink the milk and never I repeat never
go through life without as much random
swag as me okay
