so the other day it's cleaning the
dishes and I cut my finger safe to say
I'm never doing that again
hey what's up you guys so I decided I
haven't done a Q&A in quite a while you
guys always have so many questions for
me so I need to give you some answers so
for this Q&A I decided to take it to
tumblr and sub to Twitter
no offense Twitter but tumblr is a
little bit better
so if you're not following me on tumblr
you're missing out just saying let's get
right into it what would you say is the
most important thing life having a good
tumblr blog duh why is your tumblr so
hipster why is your tumblr so irrelevant
I'm kidding I'm kidding
don't be a hater dear what is the last
picture under camera roll oh god let me
see this could be interesting Oh yep
it's born food porn yeah look at it what
do you used to take and edit your photos
they're all really cool first off thank
you uh can I use my iPhone to take all
my photos and I use afterlight to edit
them that's 99 cents I've ever spent if
you could be a different person for
every day of the week who would you want
to be let's see here
me myself myself again me me Zac Efron
and then myself wearing a hat if you
were stuck in a room full of spiders
would you cry or would you cry have you
ever kissed a youtuber mm-hmm
well how many youtubers have you dated
God what's like the weirdest food you've
ever eaten clams because you're
literally taking a rock-like object that
has been at the bottom of the ocean for
its entire life and then you're sucking
out its insides pretty weird do
you believe in hakuna matata hakuna

now go oh yo we're sitting on this
bed my face is getting red because I
can't rap get me a hat to cover my face
cuz I'm a disgrace

good as pitbull do you think I'll ever
get a chance to meet you hopefully you
get stressed out really easily
unfortunately what would you do if you
were invisible for a day touch your butt

the creepiest thing I've ever said quick
