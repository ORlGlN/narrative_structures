today I'm going to review our Radio
Flyer scooter a nice fluffy handles and
it can you can adjust the height to
three different levels the handle hutton
right yep I'm gonna show me how you
write it

what I like about this scooter is to
turn just lean left ER
this is the best scooter I've ever
ridden but I'm getting a little big for
it so stay tuned to watch me test out a
bigger scooter
