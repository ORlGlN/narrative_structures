this is a breaking news update there are
prints of dinosaurs appearing in local
backyards in this form of fossils
footprints and even eggs we have some
footage showing these findings caught on
home security cameras let's take a look
and this seam right here you can see
that the dinosaurs are having some sort
of meetings it's hard to tell what
exactly is going on but the t-rex seems
to be in charge in this clip the team x
seats have discovered the security
camera
perhaps he is trying to tamper with
evidence so no one can prove that the
dinosaurs were here and now interviewing
local resident Lex Burke I found this
