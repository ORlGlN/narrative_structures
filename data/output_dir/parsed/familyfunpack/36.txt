store and all my kids are asleep and
Chris is tired so he's going to bed so
they're not here to answer questions but
I will answer a question a lot of you
guys have been asking everyone's
wondering where we moved and I thought
mommy Monday last week gave it away but
maybe I need to be a little more blunt
we did move to Hawaii we're loving it
here everyone super welcoming we've met
so many amazing people already so we're
loving it I'm wearing a listen set band
by the way I think that's the main
question everyone was asking they're
just curious about that some of you guys
are asking why we move so in your word
suddenly and I don't think it was sudden
we planned it for a while it's just that
we were kind of keeping to ourselves in
December we wanted a little bit of
private time some family time so we just
weren't posting as much and we were just
kind of doing our thing so I think you
guys could understand that so it wasn't
decided really it just probably felt
something to you guys cuz your hadn't
said anything about it and then suddenly
you're like wait a second they're moving
so that's all thanks so much for
watching today's video
