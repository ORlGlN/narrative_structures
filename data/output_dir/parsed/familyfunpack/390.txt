Mexico parts of Arizona hey buddy how

one of the coolest things we've ever
seen

other one you guys was one right over

sleeping in the car he's going to miss
out on these cool cactuses maybe a
cactus was down in that hole
look you can see the thing on the ground
like maybe it fell right here along the
ground look right here there's a dead
cactus on the ground that's too bad

hole because look see the sticks that
make up the center of the cactus
