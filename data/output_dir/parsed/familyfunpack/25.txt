we're at the park and we are about to
set up some giant swings you can tell
these things are gonna be massive and
awesome because three kids are needing
to carry just one of them here look at
this awesome tree we found you guys just
like the best tree yes I like crazy
oh and just loving watching you guys
okay they're gonna spin and swing the
super spinner is cool because you can
attach it to an existing swing set or
put your weight it which is the tree
really only took us like five minutes
goes very easy you just make a little
knot on the top and then hook this metal
thing to it and you're done
I haven't swung like this forever and
getting to hold my baby they don't make
anything big enough for parents
check out all the cool stuff we have for
sale on our website
