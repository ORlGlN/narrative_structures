hi everybody welcome to mommy Monday
before we get started I wanted to make
sure that we send our love to everybody
who's been dealing with the wildfires
and the Hurricanes I know it's been a
really hard time for a lot of people so
in today's vlog we're actually going to
be making some pillow cases and we're
gonna be mailing them so they can be
part of the relief efforts you want to
say hello to say hello everybody how you
gonna be shy but one was just sleeping
and then he woke up we should show
everybody your handprints when we were
doing our 24 hour video we did Owens
handprints and we never showed you guys
how they actually looked after their
finish so I'm gonna grab one real fast
and show you here's one of Owens
handprints we have made I think it's
just so cute and we're gonna show you
guys the other ones in his nursery tour
they're really cute too so what happened
with the Children's Choir guys yes they
both auditioned for the children's choir
I mentioned that a couple weeks ago I
think and they both made it well hello
are you playing with the baby I'm glad
that two babies can fit in there oh
that's so cute it's funny holding toys
we're here at the fabric store looking
for fabric because we're gonna make
pillow cases for our people that have
been in the hurricanes and the fires
lately
oh that one's nice okay let's put it
under the cart oh that's cute I like it
oh yeah it brings out to the blue and
rainbow in your eyes oh what's wrong
listen II put under the crafty that's a
good deal can you go there we go oh
don't be sad he's debating if he wants
to wake up or try to stay asleep
are you watching Owen for me but what
oh yeah it's really long who wants to
try this all right you're on David you
were try it yeah okay
so heat up the iron and then start
ironing out all the wrinkles out you
asked me if this was hot and I told you
I would tell you a story about what
happened when I was a little girl
they're very hot one time my mommy was
fighting and my brother was chasing me
around the house do you know like
brothers do and he chased me past my mom
who was ironing and right when I walked
by she went like this with the iron and
was putting it down and just like where
Alyssa standing my arm was right there
and I got burnt right here on my whole
arm and hurt so you always have to be
very careful when you iron to make sure
there's nobody beside you that's gonna
get burnt right we've got Michael over
there squeaking goldfish okay he's good
all right Alyssa
when my grandmother or the little girl
based put the irons into a fire to keep
them up and they were very peppy if you
come to my house and remind me I'll show
you her irons I have it as a doorstop in
my bedroom so just feel like a talented
yep that was my grandmother's iron
he says don't circle because I have a
pirate
I'm gonna stay here with everybody else
while daddy's gonna take this is
actually something much needed what is
that guy's hat cocked Erica they've got
some crazy long hair going on right now
I know if he put one quarter in them
gumballs or whatever you want hmm let's
see I do see that in your hand right
there but you should not spend your
money buying things out of machines okay
well I can't wait see how can you guys
until you come back
go have fun with Daddy bye
David accidentally put a little too much
steam and somehow got some brown stains
on our fabrics so I'm just washing it
out by hand here and I'm gonna try it
then we'll be on our way
all better
nice that looks great yeah I like it
Happy's for ironing open the steam so
the pillowcase will lay flat when we
fold it it won't have a big round spot
in it and then take a little chop and
shake it right looks good
Michael really wanted to turn
are you okay
Oh
because they make it go faster right
how does that was that feedback
are you taking me is that to my court
and you'd seen your aggression right now
that's a lot of work good job buddy oh
my super girl and I'm a person that iron
stuff don't touch those okay go ahead
and try again
what Michael oh-ho right that's true
so we've got Iron Man working with irons
and spider-man working with friends over
there I'm gonna run outside cuz I've got
someone here to get our remember
that I told you guys rebuilding a
while back well the news isn't good on
that we are letting it go today

to be so anyway we got the shed and it
was just too big of a project we never
got around to doing it we're just too
busy I had a great idea though I have
bought rainbow paint I was gonna have
the kids paint their hands along it and
it was gonna be so cute
but I think these people ability isn't
more than we would anyway so I'm just
kind of glad to have it out of a yard at
this point and they fit that whole shed
in their truck talk about amazing okay
