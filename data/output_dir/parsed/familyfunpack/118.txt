hey everybody we're here at the park and
we have some games and some pretty fun
stuff planned for the cage let's go my
boys love garbage trucks so today we're
turning trash into treasure and throwing
a garbage Steve's party in the park
you

just best time
Oh jumping jacks ready

on your mark
we're going to play tug of war you guys
are look at your teeth color and if it
crosses the tone the other team wins on
your bar go
next we're going to do the rubbish relay
okay here's how it goes
the first team member puts on the best
and then you run down with your trash
bags you pick up a balloon and put it
back in when you come back you trade the
vests to your other team members and
then they go down and get them all and
come back then you trade back until use
on all ten balloons
Oh

guys have to take these balloons and try
to throw them into your teen waste trash
bag
this last piece is trash mess you guys
are going to try to smash a pinata and
also it hit us back at the same time
they're bowls up there okay first one
breaks first
Wow
