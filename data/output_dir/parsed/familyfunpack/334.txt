to be making up okay now before I open
my gel I'm going to show you some other
things I got from MC squared

lava lamp with Mikayla if you haven't
seen that video then be sure to watch it
I also have this cool composition book

journal and look at my cool ring

zipper where you open it tada

book and even a real working microscope

tablespoon of baking cakes
