accounts from do well al Lawrence who
asks why one the kids can play the piano
now first of all if you don't know I'm
an accountant teacher for the last 15
years
so piano is just my life I had to be the
Korean college and I've studied music
also since a child and when I married
man he was musical both of our parents
are musical so I should kind of like our
family pink there's also a lot of
studies that have shown that brain
development in your hands my early high
school tree so we like to get our kids
to get this kind of care even walk up
some you know really
so we really like me it can also I feel
like it's something that you can enjoy
to put your my grandma had arthritis and
when she wasn't raised at ninety she was
still playing to help with arthritis she
said it helped her fingers and let them
feel better and I also feel like you
can't really play basketball on your way
now you need but you can definitely
enjoy music and showing my leg at the
cottage so make sure you live long I
think our kids can enjoy it's something
Meghan enjoys and family as a group
singing together playing music together
so overall I'm just here supporter of
music in the arc where do we get hurt we
got caught up when David was like 9
months old she was so cute we looked up
someone on Craigslist that had puppies
because we decided randomly one day
because our spontaneous that we loaded a
dog so we just looked her up that with
someone that have puppies went to their
house
and look at the litter and
little white puppy she has a smallest
head of all the puppies in the litter
and she had been widened to suffer even
I have seen look she was so beautiful so
we picked her out she obviously was the
perfect dog for us because she is the
best cop I've ever met in my life
so that's Kona and then some people also
were asking about her puppies and we do
have a video of the puppies but the
puppies have all gone to their own
families and we still keep in contact
with one of the other puppies they're
doing great they're also very beautiful
dogs just like going out of course
