taking a video because I came downstairs
and I thought this was hilarious I was
laying in the box that we used as an
incubator for all the puppies and I
think she's just sick of nursing them
all the time so this is small for but
that's kind of a cage that she hangs out
in and this is her whelping area there
she is
apparently really comfortable in the
incubator
goodbye color do you see cover it's you
silly silly huh
next time island will go single again
cool maybe she will sit back and say
bye-bye
look at the camera say bye bye bye bye
