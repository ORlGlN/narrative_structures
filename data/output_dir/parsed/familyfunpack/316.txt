all the toys and presents with his coat
in this hat I look just like Saint Nick

like Saint Nick mean mr. Grinch you
really are a heel you're as cuddly as a
cactus yours charming as an eel this

Grinch your heart and taeho your brain
is full of spiders you've got garlic in
your soul mr. rich I wouldn't touch you
with a thirty nine and a half foot pole

the tender sweetness of a seasick
crocodile mystery hinge given the choice
between you I take the seasick crocodile
