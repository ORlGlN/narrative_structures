imagination putting on the shelves in
the dream case and one of the dreams was
something I always wanted as a kid which
was a wrap gift that could be a birthday
present or some kind of a present with
graphing in a boat and before I opened

questions you guys submitted on last
week's episode one of the questions a
couple of you guys asked was how deep is
our pool and our pool is I think like
eight to ten feet deep it's pretty deep
I don't actually know the exact depth
the next question that a lot of you guys
were asking pads do with the kids
favorite fruits and vegetables so I'm
going to let them answer that right now
so tell me your favorite fruit and
vegetable I think my favorite vegetable
is definitely cry about this sweet night

proof one that's our pineapple cherries

in pairs watermelon what's your favorite
vegetable
what do you like peas whatever he just
said no there he goes I'm watermelon
because it is really good and
cold-hearted you guys all love corn Jeff
Barker asks about the terrible twos with
Michael and I have to say he really
didn't have the terrible twos Michael
was a really really good two-year-old
and I personally think that it's more
the terrible threes I think sometimes
three-year-olds are a little more
strong-willed and a little harder to
deal with and two-year-olds cuz
two-year-olds are syllable babyish till
at least in my opinion and from my
experience with my kids anyway thanks so
much for watching everybody don't forget
to leave us a thumbs up on the video
leave us your questions for next week's
episode and have an awesome
