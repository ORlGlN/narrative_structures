hi everybody
it is Monday morning I just dropped off
the kids at school I've been home
cleaning the house and I decided I would
film my first episode of mommy Monday so
basically what I'm going to be doing in
these episodes is kind of showing you
guys some of my tips and tricks I'll be
showing you my favorite products I'll
just kind of be blogging about what I do
during my day a lot of you guys have
asked about how I keep organized so
today that's the first thing I'm going
to talk about is my organization so I'm
going to show you guys my garage
this is the side of my garage let's see
if I can get an angle ticket Seattle
this is like most of my kids clothes
from their whole lives
Kate clothes can get expensive so I've
saved all my kids clothes since they
were born so that each cake can wear the
other kits hami downs so these are
clothes it Chris Zach and David all worn
that Michael's going to grow into here
are some of the other boxes and then
down here I have stuff that I've gotten
as hand-me-downs for David to grow into
this is how I organize my kid clothes
and then in my garage over here I have
shoes so these are your gold shoes the
kids boots in that box we do soccer
cleats because they're right by the door
for the kids to go in and out and grab
them real fast and then here we have all
the rest of the shoes and then more
boots in a pen I'm actually about to put
some more labels on these bins I got
these cute little dogs
and I label the outside of the drawers
with the children's first initial so
they know which drawer has their shoes
since you put it away
oops try again there it goes so I've
been going through the boys clothes and
the seasons are kind of changing so I'm
pulling out some of the summer jammies
and I am put them in the box
there's my label and I'm going to take
Michel on a walk
