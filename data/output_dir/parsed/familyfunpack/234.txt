okay so we're gonna answer some
questions that came from you guys this
week the first question I chose was kind
of interesting one it comes from and may
thank you and she asked if there's ever
something I wanted as a kid and didn't
get but I got as an adult so that's like
a question I would say that there's not
really anything specific that I can
think of that I got for myself as an
adult but there's things that I got for
my kids that I wish I would have had as
a kid
one of them is letting them be in sports
we put all of our kids in soccer and
that's something I wish I could have
done as a kid I never did sports because
my parents couldn't afford it so um
Michael's making me lose my train of
thought um oh the other thing that we
got for our kids that we both thought
would be really cool that we would have
loved to have a we were kids is a ball
pit so our kids have a ball pit do you
guys have all bit trampoline Oh
trampoline do you know how much I
believe as a kid no I always went to my
cousin's house because they had one but
that was like three hours away so I had
a trampoline that we got when we were
like 12 I thought of us all and my
siblings were all younger it was like my
favorite toy ever so yeah our kids love
the trampoline oh I guess you love the
trampoline with your younger self the
next question comes from a ton of you
