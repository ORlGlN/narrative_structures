well that was pretty fun and we've never
celebrated Chinese New Year before so I
think that was a cool cultural
experience for the kids
it was extremely loud but very cool I
didn't know that they threw the lettuce
I asked someone afterwards why that
wasn't she said it was kind of like
about prosperity and the earth growing
and all those kind of things and giving
back and I didn't know that they fed
them money this is really cool so that
was fun
now we're off to the carnival we're
doing what we do best
you getting some cheese on the top
some money on them
okay
today
those are the free games I believe it
good job
we left the carnival it was fun the kids
had a fun time getting free stuff and
playing games and we decided to stop at
that Dole Plantation they have some good
shopping and we didn't really buy much
last time we were here so we decided to
come back
putting a picture

we're waiting for them simple motion
really excited with a really yellow
tongue

Elissa made a video about hiding rocks
that she's painted and we hid one here
at the Dole Plantation and she was
excited because someone came out and
nobody had found it yet

we're gonna answer some questions for
you guys the president comes from angel
who wants to know what kind of pet I had
I think what your question is and
possibly Matt when we were growing up so
I had a lot of pets
I had hermit crabs I had a ring neck
parakeet I had other parakeets fish my
dad brought a snake home I had turtles I
had a dog lots of dogs different dogs
got my ears just lots and lots of yeah
we told the kids about our turtle Matt
had an iguana he had a dog and Matt also
had a turtle something interesting is
that my mom had a pet skunk when she was
a kid so that's good ting wants to know
what is your favorite movie
sorry whitehurst asks if you can invent
something moment I like that
to fly why don't you Michael what would
you invent a li sweep he wants to know
what time do you guys usually go to bed
I think you guys usually go to bed
between 8:00 and 9:00 but if we're like
out and about the kids bed about a
little later so it kind of depends
oh my gosh that makes me so nervous oh
he's getting it too okay well that was
crazy here you guys a little nervous I
don't like that sound anymore
