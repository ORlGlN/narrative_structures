hi guys today we're gonna play Tonka
climb overs
we're gonna assemble the ripsaw summit
in the Buller rough sketch
we've got dowdy helping assemble these
he's good in cars we're making some
progress on this but these are
definitely a little tricky to sniff
together
look at all these cruel cards
yeah that's for film in the family
ownership magazine
oh the green guy fell off
oh this track here is the full set plus
we had a couple on the starter kit set
so they can build a ramp
Damon how did you like the tongues of my
mortals
definitely cool with their climb hardly
yeah like what like like when you push
the button you've done the Australian
they kind of a fall off the ramps as
well yeah so do you highly recommend
them or not recommend them at all or
just kind of recommend it
