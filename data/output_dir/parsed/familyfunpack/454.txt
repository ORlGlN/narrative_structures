for a quick easy dinner that anyone can
make try Peter Brad pizza first put your
bread on the tray Peter Brown is really
good for you because it has a lot of
protein next put your sauce on my family
likes ranch red sauce and barbecue sauce
next you add your cheese let's Michael
over there playing with his fridge toys
almost done
the last step is to add your toppings my
family likes pineapples and olives is
easy it's okay to sample while you're
cooking for the last step you might need
a grown-ups help to put it in the oven
make sure of it is 375 in Fahrenheit
after 10 minutes your pieces done thanks
for watching
Michaels or in your region the pizza how
do you guys like pizza you want to make
it all the time pretty good huh
