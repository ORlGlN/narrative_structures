and he just got me the newest toy from
LITTLEST PET SHOP I can't wait to open
it first I'm going to open the style set
all you have to do is put the birch
together tell me muffins
they're like smell a little bit you
could stick in the holes I come like
this
look you could even decorate your pets
I finished the front of the cat shop and
look at this cute doggie door and
putting the flowers on next I'm going to
decorate the curtains they have a dead
fish but I'm not going to use it
you can combine steps in right now my
two sets are stacked on top of each
other so this piece right here is
double-sided is the finished project
there's a bookshelf back there and look
she's crying because she lost her
icecream
and there's you see that there's still
more stickers to decorate with
