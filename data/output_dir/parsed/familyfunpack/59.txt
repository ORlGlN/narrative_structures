what they are cuz I'm gonna get them
twin kids for Christmas but if I can
very carefully show them there we go
that's all you get anyway it was like
$10 to get one of the movies that I got
I don't know if I was really worth it
though because we were in there forever
the lines were super long and I feel
like I kind of wasted my time but I mean

time was probably more valuable punish
