cream / I love fudge me too
here's everything you need to make this
recipe first we're gonna crush some
cookies put the cookies in the bag and
smash up looks good
makes together three cups of sugar
I choose the jump a cup of evaporated
milk
last add 3/4 of a cup of butter
heat it to a rolling boil stir it
constantly
it's boiling three more minutes and
we'll take it off the heat that looks so
cool
three minutes is a long time to stir add
one jar of marshmallow cream
add two cups of white chocolate chips
smells delicious
add one teaspoon of vanilla add 1/2 cup
of crushed cookies stir it all together
whoa it looks really cool I think we
should just eat it right now looks so
good put your fudge into a square dish
stop first cut wax paper sprinkle over
cut the cookies across the top
use a knife to gently swirl right in
chill it for an hour or until it's firm
it's all done let's see how it turned
out
for loosening up the edges here we go Oh
