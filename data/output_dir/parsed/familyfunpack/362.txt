as most of you know my family loves
Disney so you can imagine my excitement
when Disney reached out about their new
show pickle and peanut it's a new show
on Disney XD about two teenagers
celebrating the small wins from their
funny adventures and the show they build
a toilet paper board we showed this to
our kids and of course they fell in love
with it any port anywhere is right at my
kids alley
okay I heard by other girls
