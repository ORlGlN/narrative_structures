okay okay okay gotta wake up in the
morning man's pasty third time this week
oops either running late or walk slow
like I'm only 22
P sounds better than your passing out
see the money I can't even count them
love what you join it strive for the
best beer right people who you never
feel the need to just
the first day of comic-con is always so
exciting because they're like I wonder
what new stuffs gonna happen and then
the first thing that happens is all the
old stuff oh is this more this is like a
modified you buy a bunch of passes that
you probably don't even need because
there's so many people that they're not
gonna be able to check everyone and all
that happiness and excitement over the
next four days slowly turns into a smell
of nacho cheese and someone says a
hundred eighty thousand people are
coming this year that's terrible
another reason I love comic-con is its
mop people it's a bunch of nerds but
unlike VidCon it they're not
specifically there for youtubers so I
can actually enjoy stuff and then see
people five or ten at a time
and then of course because it's Comic
Con I just love seeing cosplayers
and also there are parties
or for Darrin unfortunately there are
parties and even though I know you
should just drank a ton of water before
he went to bed my heart went out to him
because the only thing worse than having
a hangover is having a hangover around
180,000 people what's cool about
comic-con is they're all these places
where you don't actually need a badge
Nintendo had a place I went and I played
Super Smash Bros Wii you go into
Microsoft to get my hands on Madden 15
and utterly destroyed a 12 year old
asian boy then of course because I loved
it so much last year I had to do the
Walking Dead zombie run which was so
much harder this year there's so many
more zombies piece of meat can i it's
extra creepy as I eat my house I hung
around Joe and Steve's booth so I can
meet every landline
I haven't organized
I've gotten two hours sleep in the past
three days right now just do a quick pan
this isn't even the bad part we're not
even in the hole right now this is just
the back and there's a moment every
comic-con where I go okay I'm done I
think it was at the Suicide Girls party
which was really cool to watch until you
saw the audience kind of being skeezy
that was my moment where I was like okay
our Comic Cons don't make me feel the
end of the day just do me
see
everybody
see you
boils down to good people good times
you impressed by that bark or what was
the painting
