hi oh my god there's way closer though
that was gonna be so I just got a new
vlogging camera it is an rx100 mark 5
which means maybe nothing to a lot of
you something to some of you and for me
it's just it's the name of the thing
that I'm holding my hand which is cool
so I I got this camera because one I'm
gonna be out of the studio for a while
so I'm not going to be around Joe and a
bunch of the guys and I want to I want
to go a little bit just with a just to
feel it just to feel it out editing
again myself just because I know that I
have a lot of fun with it
and then too there's something there's
something about the way that I talk to
the camera that I talk to you that's
different than sometimes the stuff that
I do around the office yeah oh it feels
good feels good
it probably looks close to the same but
come on I like I like certain constants
in my life my hair is one it's good oh I
think I want to get some Buffalo Wild
Wings and go see a movie that's what
that's what I'm gonna do cuz I'm a
grown-ass person with grown-ass money I
can do what I want until five eacher on
this this this camera I keep wanting to
say phone because I've been filming with
my phone's one feature on this camera is
a really good slo-mo apparently so
I see water gonna test it out it would
be more interesting than like seeing me
slap myself in slow-mo because I'll get
it later they're bitter my favorite
little black here let's see
we're like one day this is gonna be much
wither icon you
so quickly review manchester by the CEO
most upset Manchester United
loved him I've no no if I've ever had a
movie made me both happy and sad at the
same time but that's what will be
accomplished it's amazing
also you probably can't hear me I don't
know why I chose to I mainly chose to
film myself here so that I could I'm
slowly I'm slowly getting more
comfortable holding a stupid camera out
and public okay I'm gonna go now I'm
gonna stop talking I promise

surprise oh really
hmm that's so cute
it's amazing this is like yeah it's
perfect one love coffee too - anything
with pictures uh-huh this camera is so
stable was that fun what so final
takeaways from this video one I have
learned that with this camera
especially when I'm shooting 4k it's not
recording for like the first two seconds
I think it is which is also why some of
the editing is weird because I had to
edit in a way where I was cutting out
stuff that I thought I was already
saying but I wasn't - why is this spot
red why three in case anyone's gonna
leave comments no I was not sponsored by
anyone that was featured in this video I
just know what I like and I likes what I
like ro finally for in case you forgot
