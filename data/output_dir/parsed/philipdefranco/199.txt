through my vine today because if you
haven't heard mine is dying it's going
away eventually in like a few months or
maybe a few weeks I don't know the
timeline doesn't make sense the most
part 90% of my vines were just like Oh

scrolling through I realized that
through six seconds at a time I got to
watch my son grow up which is this kind
of amazing beautiful thing I get that a
little bit out of vlogs the family vlogs
