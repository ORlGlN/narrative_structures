dear cell phone I don't like the people
judge me for having an anxiety attack
when I don't have you in my hand you are
me rather an extension of Who I am I
mean stomach acid and bacteria are
technically part of me but stomach acid
nor bacteria ever helped me get laid I
love you cell phone you connect me I
love your you're angry birds i love that
you have a front facing cam so i can
stare at myself while I take a picture
of myself I love that you have an app
that lets me play flash video so i can
watch non html5 porn and even when i
turn you on airplane mode for eighty
percent of day because i actually hate
getting phone calls and that's what your
main purpose used to be no i love you
your's always philip defranco
