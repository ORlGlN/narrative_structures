movie and it came out before I was born
how much of it have you seen hold on I
will tell you I have seen the first 12
minutes and 35 seconds I would have had
a heart attack when the horse comes out
of the closet the doll is thrown into
the darkness is lame and the parents are
assholes wait we're talking about the
movie with the little people yeah I'm
happy that they use little people actors
for the little people yeah but that's
Hobbit that's the only reason I'm
worried about you
