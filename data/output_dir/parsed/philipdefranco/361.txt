sup guys I decided today to play draw
fool with a few friends which if you've
never played is actually fantastic game
not a sponsor just wanting to play games
pretty simple everybody gets a thing
that they have to draw they then draw
that thing on their phone and each round
we get to see one person's creation
everyone except the creator of the
picture then types in what they think
that it is slash something to trick any
of the other players then everyone has
to guess which of the things on the
screen is the actual drawing you get
points when you guess correctly and you
get points when someone picks your
answer instead of the real thing if it
sounds confusing it usually is for one
round and then it's super super easy
ah
yes the reason I turned around is it
said you entered the correct
oh say I'm just using it's not that is a
crazy way to people ro Jack and Jill
oh my god well thank you for watching
whatever the hell this video was also
I'm gonna sink the video and two
programmers alright
shit sorry
