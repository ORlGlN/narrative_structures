I remember though I'll I completely fell
for that during this bullshit man
that's Jason Hervey from Wonder Years
and back to the future write down the
first season was so good well that
they're the Ghostbusters costume
David Harbor with that shovel hot
ah that's it that music gets me
let's count them as I peek at my peak
most underwhelming part of it is the
fact words like Halloween which is such
a you can have to wait a fucking long
time that's like 10 months from now way
too far away that needs to happen now
stupid I want to know why they're
wearing Ghostbusters costumes when no
one else around them was wearing
Ghostbusters costumes yep looks like
more stranger things I absolutely love
this trailer I'm going to be honest I
watched it like eight more times last
night when I got home it's amazing what
a 30-second montage of a show that you
really love can do for your heart rate I
don't really care if it's first season
hope the rocks and it though that's cool
I've pretty much feelings about this I
was pretty happy with season one I think
it wrapped up real nice
I'm pumped I'm one glad that I didn't
see barb I know that some people love
barb I don't give a damn about barb the
first season is so good that I wish the
second season was something different
like an anthology it seems like the
upside down is now not the upside down
anymore everything is when the first
season ended I was like I don't know
where they're going to go at all from
this like it's just been encapsulating
and amazing but I was pretty satisfied
with season 1 I feel like season 2 is
going to be them stretching things out
or doing bizarre stuff I don't really
know what it's about aside for that
giant monster which I want to know what
that is the giant monster and like the
sky I want all of the whatever that
crazy thing at the end is I want and one
more fact I'm watching whatever that I
want to know what the big creature is it
looks like world's world but my favorite
and / least favorite thing of the
trailer is the fucking monster in the
sky I hate War of the Worlds the Tom
Cruise version and it looks like that
fucking monster alien in the sky and I
fucking hate that movie because I hate
Dakota Fanning I get it but I'm excited
I guess I'll give it a shot
I'll give it a chance oh fuck this is
going to be like a huge big thing I'm
sure it'll be fine little kids are fun
no one should bring up barb I'm glad
oh you want a buzzkill hey can we have
more of a buzzkill on the show I
understand that she was written boring
that's fine as a current flash a
part-time boring person I got to say
whatever
done don't need you
