hello interwebs I'm currently in a hotel
room because I'm Latin Tony fell out a
blackboxtv at my house and so a lot of
people been asking Phil show us videos
of when you were overseas well I have
been posting those videos for one reason
or another Lindsey said you had hurt me
and so Lindsey's been posting those
videos to her account and I thought hey
let me let me show you guys one of the
videos so this is gonna be a part two of
Venice if you want to see part one or
any of the other videos of myself
overseas or there's there's some stuff
of Lindsey by herself overseas link in
the description below
watch click that after this video but
here is a video of myself and Linds hoy
in Venice Italy not California you'll
notice considers less homeless people
but it still smells like peas so there's
that also I've been asked to inform you
that Lindsey edited these videos and I
had nothing to do with them which is why
they're better is that is that
everything that you want me to say what
is that a really go crazy salad and now
we're gonna go on a grande cow
the one to the right side is one over
the school we have a high school in
Venice so since that we may don't have
but we have the fact is that may be
awesome an official school because they
were converted world private policies
once upon a times that's why you can't
recognize like an official school
because they were converted there was
he's not saying here but they'd be like
okay
yeah we're not a we're not flooded
look at the last night and this makes
you bridges pretty cool kind of like
stages you have a jump okay and then you
have to jump this gap I believe it yeah
they're like it's cold dude really you
want to be on the water okay how do we
fun to see we can't get footage of us
hold it against different ways
Thank You Oprah scared
I see how it goes a little nervous no
that's pretty
all this stuff with lights that's gonna
look pretty at night we're gonna be able
to see okay it's not our faces
which I guess is dead he's now on death
none of you can see us when we decided
to make basis for the people comes by
that want to take it
pictures of dad put your face in a bit
okay you can't see Oh sucks
another opportunity to pose it was
really eerie at night I liked though
like cuz we were going out today right
whenever going out today it was like
everyone was out like everyone and their
brother and their mother and the sister
was out so much so that even tourists
went but tonight there was like you pass
maybe three gondolas it was all couples
it was awesome
not the gondolas and people on Nautilus
which is the eerie myth that seems like
no one lived in the building right but
he was telling us our gondola person I
found earlier our gondolier he's telling
us how in most buildings no one lives on
the the ground floor and that's because
the water you know often floods the
first are the ground floor so it's
really creepy you know going by the
ground floor it just seemed deserted let
me look up and there's some lights on
but I don't know what do you mean me on
it doesn't come up with all our ideas
oh wait wait no no you have to do
another head turn you do the head turn
then you walk away can I do you it was
good
that should be your own yeah your own
where in the world is Matt dance how you
do it again
