hello I'm about to film the film buddy
buddy buddy buddy with room the PDS and
right before I went into it the new
trailer for the new x-men movie came out
it looks awesome I was into it and then
I realized I can't tell if it's as epic
of a trailer and I'm as excited or it's
purely the music not to fully take away
from it but sound is such a big thing
for movies and movie trailers I mean it
look for look at a requiem for a dream
like that movie is amazing but it's
nothing without the score that goes
along with it and so I was like what is
this music that's making me care and
giving me goosebumps and then I realized
it's actually from the the movie
sunshine which if you have not watched
should it's awesome it's beautiful but
it's a song called Canada's death part
to Adagio in demon might've
mispronounced that but who knows
you probably ah but I want to see if I
could make something that made me feel
something that is about nothing and so I
wanted to see that now and this could be
a failure or it could be decent
there will come a day
a day
not far from today
or a man would come
and knock on your door
and that man will have cookies
and you'll let him in when you put out
the cookies
you know pour milk
and you will dip that cookie you will
let it soak and you'll put that cookie
in your mouth and it will taste amazing
and you'll have another
and another stopping just before it
feels like you're too full
and it's more than you dip in cookie
it's more than a group of people dipping
cookies it's the idea of a man dipping a
cookie it's the belief that one can but
a man can do that people will look back
on this day they will look back on this
day as today everything changed this one
man tried you I didn't download the full
song because you have to buy the album I
hate when I do that I might download the
entire album well yeah I don't know I uh
I kind of want to I want to try and do
that several times I want to see if
other people can do that so maybe
challenge to you if you want to make an
epic speech it's not epic to that song
send it to me
