hey Phil so you working always always
working yeah it's just it's just
non-stop I'm I try to be playing some
play around now on battleground
oh you like you'd rather be playing
right now Phil well too bad because
today we're just working it is a busy
day I feel like I feel like today is
like the day with the least amount of
downtime in the past we go out
yeah but let's be honest still we're
having so much fun every day even when
we're working we're having a fucking
blast I feel like you're leading me
somewhere I feel like you're going down
a road well I got a lot of comments so
just go to the comments a lot of people
saying like you guys have so much fun
and want to work here and they should
want to because it's true I can't tell
if you just like what you're talking
slow like that if it's because you're
trying to think of something or you're
trying to think of making sure that
you're not saying something it's a
little bit of both here's the thing like
the people that make this office they
make their office the office in between
down times or when people are working on
projects but a lot like 85% of this job
is people like me needing to be in a
room by myself screaming or people just
like working behind a keyboard so yeah
have a fucking blast
well good luck good luck hope to you for
making and you for whatever ride you're
about to be honest
