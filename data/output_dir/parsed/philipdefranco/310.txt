just finish the show instead that I'll
take ten minutes the last if I took a
cab it's gonna take 20 minutes more so
I'm just walking I've never been to New
York comic-con I've only ever gone to
San Diego we've gone there like six
seven of those interested to see how
it's gonna be interesting because I was
born here but it doesn't doesn't feel
like home anymore but there's someone
that's so terrified of a
being enlargers people I sure do
yeah yeah did you yeah this is an
interesting way to start
it's like unlike San Diego there's no it
feels like there's no buffer straight in
Oh
Triforce you ever seen like an evil
but smaller things or like really large
things like that
large things from the office they made
them make sense a boy
that's the guy that I most awestruck by
I didn't even notice over here
you know your regular cosplay photos
yes my name it's Shay said Shay what
Shay Carl's so why why did you give me
this present I don't think it suits me
I think I'm good thank you for summer I
was about to shove my hand in your face
that I realized I'm only allowed to do
that with my employees
Oh we'll say while I miss Lindsay and
Trey there is one nice thing about being
on the road and that is I get to wake up
the way I like to wake up ain't got no
shame when I'm home because I'm on the
west coast I wake up so early that I end
up having to like turn the lights off
before I open doors and sneak out but
that's really it that's the only that's
the only real positive I miss I miss my
butt but as for yesterday was really fun
as you saw I walked the floor what you
didn't see a lot of was me meeting the
nature knows because I try put the
camera away so I can actually be in
people's pictures and it was great
meeting so many of you guys I love you
faces decided not to go back today I'd
rather just walk around the city and
just enjoy the weather which is really
really good right now enjoy just
actually walking around so many people
and feeling like a part of something
which actually you guys made me feel
yesterday I thought yesterday was gonna
be just a shit show of a video and
everyone like crushing me and I still
like to post those videos even though I
have those fears because sometimes even
if a video doesn't resonate with some
people it's just good to get it out of
your head so that like the shitty thing
can get out of the way so that the good
thing can move forward but I'm I'm glad
that so many of you guys like really
really enjoyed it I think that's to know
that I want to end you on thank you for
being a part of my family we may not
always agree every now and then there's
an asshole that comes over for dinner
but we're family that's it I love you
faces remember you can come back to this
channel it's going to be around 7 p.m.
Eastern 4 p.m. Pacific there's gonna be
that live stream that I was talking
about the other day so enjoy that but
the main point I have a great fucking
day
I have to share with the world the man
that just terrifies me holy shit I love
