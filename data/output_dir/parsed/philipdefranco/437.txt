come here my baby my annoying little
baby
it's Wednesday's are exceptionally fun
because the neighbors have a garden act
that I feel like I feel like comes
around at like 6:30 737 7 o'clock
because there's nothing more refreshing
than the sound of a weed whacker seven
that's seven it's a nine a.m. activity I
think I think so
no but apparently over the course of the
past two months
that person has become aces mortal enemy
and so they well they he barks so that
we all know that the enemy is near and
then we wake up and then we say no
that's good I want to take credit for
this
that's a that's one of the things you
don't get to see a lot of pussy times
I'm like what the camera can film you
have to take
but uh is good you're not perfect pretty
pretty good kid sale on the last but we
got through a spotty time as fuzzy Tiger
tonight fortify them again yeah
and he'll go to sleep
bring the car seat originally even
though we did Jim Jim kept saying he's
like you gotta bring will see so try the
treacherous time Economy Comfort pretty
green oh do it
mmm baby drunk baby like a new serious
drunk baby account he had a really hard
day of work that's his dead sleep yeah
it is anyway is two two sleeps yeah he
has any little sound wakes me up then I
have to stare at it and like the whole
plane could flip and he'd be like good
you ready grandpa if you had 20 seconds
to say something - tre what is it
beautiful
hey so Lindsay yeah one second there's a
Papa DeFranco behind so if you have your
20 seconds to say something that's very
well to be hi tre I love you and they
think about it makes me wanna cry a lot
I think about it I think about how much
I love my god I believe that pension
wait what is this you it's like thank
you what's the first meal you're gonna
make in 20 seconds what's something you
want to say to tre on your first
motorcycle with your dad on his first
motorcycle and we're just
so grandma on this spot 20 seconds
oh it's time to do something with you I
think about you when I'm at Target to
cry there it is
Wow easier than a baby yeah just a
little bit 20 seconds to say something
to Trey what would it be right now
like automatically you are so loved
you have this big wonderful family that
will always embrace you and always just
be strong and be brave and go experience
life follow your heart
nation I'm having a lake date with
Lindsay tre Lindsay's parents and
they're uh they're just relaxing in the
shade so I thought I'd steal their
waverunner and then do it myself because
that is what you do when you see a jet
ski you have to take it if you don't if
you don't take that opportunity that
should probably be more illegal than
actually stealing it fun obviously
there's the fun part of just going as
fast as possible but what's interesting
is this I have a slate guy hit by a
tornado tornado the house he rebuilt you
can see in like a tree line here and
there it's kind of crazy but that said
you have to the fun part
and back to work
