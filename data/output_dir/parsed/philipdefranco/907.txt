hey guys so um it's Monday and we got to
do the show but we can't do the show
unless we start with an amazingly I was
going to say good but it's not really
good had to Franco breakfast which
involves four things he got the griddle
the Canadian bacon the cheese and the
eggs you want to make sure that we don't
get
so right now we're looking good looking
like an aborted fetus so once you're an
aborted fetus stage go ahead and move on
with Lady and bacon let me have a
regular breakfast now if I was smarter
we used a smaller plate it would look
like a really good meal but I mean you
know so eggs cheese clay make it
it's good it's lokar me out if you want
carbs you don't put all on top of a
bagel obvious
