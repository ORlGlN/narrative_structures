blob is now walking around almost person
blob married almost kind of forgot that
one don't tell Lindsey I also just
turned 30 which is what I'm gonna use as
a reason for why I just forgot that it's
weird with time everything seems so
close yet far away before we jump into
the New Year I want to just kind of
remember this year so we made this
I was born on the same Road my heart I
find my home
in a dark sky falling in my way tonight
and there's you
I want you to say
hi I will wait for you
I'll never forget the moment Phil
realized he was gonna marry Lyndsey it
was just you and me hanging out at your
place
Lyndsey was out of town and Philip
mentioned to me he said I'm really tired
and I was thinking about something ah
tough tough day to play an xbox but he
was tired why you tired
and he says because Lindsey's out of
town any time Lindsey's out of town I
never get a good night's sleep may God
bless your family into a long and happy
marriage

honeymoon so I'm gonna go enjoy this
