nation I made a terrible mistake last
night I opened up a box of cashews and
it's a fancy profession so it's probably
like $137 that's a very specific
reference to me now it's gonna be an
obnoxious amount and I regret it I do
also question when you're at a fancy
hotel why is the internet worse than
normal hotels and or sometimes shitty
hotels why that makes no sense to me at
all it seems like you know everything
would scale upwards but no not true
yeah why not live it up live in hey
what's up mail how are you I'm so good

this is the best anniversary party you
could ever have cheers to you

oh wait I don't know what the hell
you're doing now what I thought you were
going to do the split I didn't know how
did everyone we just met become flexible
what is happening what is happening none
of this makes sense as a impressive
because you're so bad you want to come
party with but then we did not party
because I am an old man I'm an old man
heyno not even a young man's body
anymore I'm just slowly becoming an old
man I uh I had a bunch of clips that I
was like I kept thinking like I want to
make a vlog and then I make one thing

by itself so just putting this together
to say hey I love your faces I haven't
seen in a while but I've random uh but
