Sup you beautiful bastards I hope you're having a fantastic 4th of July
I kind of just wanted to throw out this this random video
today because I was on Twitter this morning and I was doing my my
morning thing where sometimes I say you know "what stories would you like me to talk about?"
I like to at least try and include one story
that the audience wants to hear.
This morning when I tweeted it
out,
There were a lot of people saying
How about you don't work?
don't work today, why would you do that?
My response to that is well I give the entire team
the day off I I ask anyone else
if they want to come in you know you're more than welcome
we, we, can figure out if there is something
monetarily that makes sense or maybe you could get a, a day off
later in the week you can do any whatever you want
As far as me, I mean understand that I am
where I am today uh in part thanks to happen stance,
lucky timing, luck in
general the algorithm whatever the hell that is and also because
to help my chances working when other people
don't right? Doing, doing what other people
will not do, that is, that's what I do it's not like
this is a crazy
sacrifice for me it's
me doing a job that I love
right so it's easier there but,
that's really it I work when many others don't
I  I I don't ask of my
team anything that I have not done in the past
or would not be willing to do
one second
I mean I still take off my end of the year stuff you know
Christmas Vacation, things like that but it almost
feels for me for my personal
life, it, it almost makes sense to
work on July 4th if you really think about it
241 years ago the forefathers
of this country just regular people
regular people who are born
into this world, who decided to, to sign
the declaration of  independence, they
they separated  themselves from their past they
separated themselves from control
and, and they, they forged on
into a future they forged on
to create a world that they personally
wanted to live in, to a much smaller degree
a less scary degree that's
what I'm choosing to do today I
I am an independent creator
choosing to work to
build a future that I want to build
Or something like that I just kind of wanted to ramble to
a camera outside The Phillip DeFranco show which is going
up later today, that said have a fantastic 4th of
July unless you don't celebrate in which case
have a baller Tuesday, baller Tuesday's a thing
I apparently say now, okay
bye bye
