a first I have never played a finger
board game of skate but I realize that
no one really finger boards other than
me in Cincinnati do you know anyone no
yeah I am I asked Casey I was like you
go to hand board and I'll finger board
and that's what's happening God what do
you what are you working with Casey's a
hangnail board that was sent to us like
last year some time and the only time I
play within is one my mom films oh oh
well there you go okay so he has a
hangnail I have a revive tech deck it's
a little wide I'm not used to so I think
Casey might actually win this because
I've been watching him warm up that's
really lame to say warm up but my
fingers ready you get in my hands I feel
like a penguin when I hand more like
that we're gonna two or three four on
four just use those first we each get
three tries to make and match does that
make sense yeah cool we'll try to get
warmed up Casey dang it dang it ha

conversation like that all phone call
should be react quick I mean

gifted you go okay try a nollie bigspin
frontside bigspin is just dumb with
impressive on finger boards it was hard

last letter gets four tries so you get
one more try I do I'm dead I lay on that
though dude grip we're really good front
