piece of paper print a brick what's in
your hand right now fantastic roots by
the way thanks man I appreciate that
it's like 15 things 1660 I think there's
16 you have to do 16 tricks did you make
a trick less boring no it's like open
for interpretation okay how you wanna do
these tricks okay but you got to do a
trick on every obstacle and I think I
listed them all okay every obstacle in
the park gotta do one trick within ten
minutes okay they got to be admirable
tricks okay Craig has got to give a
thumbs up okay so if you go doing a
front board in the flat bar I hope it
gives you a thumbs down you like that we
will fire Craig and Craig we'll never
have that that job no matter what I do I
just drive no I'm scared
no no I mean what I'm just saying you
know we're like we're like the the
producers okay he's a director producers
