my name is Andy and this here is the
skateboard
so what do look three flip and this does
not rhyme that was ridiculously hard
does it have a strap
pretty sure just broke my body saving
the guitar dude I think everything is
broken apologies
told you what three flip and this does
not rhyme so if that was weird I'm sorry
but that was one of the hardest things
I've ever done and I'd like to thank
this tude for going through it and
filming me it's like just in the sunlit
sunlit that's I'm in a word sunlight hat
goodbye
