the trucks off your board I'm gonna make
it more scalable in a different scalable
kind of way let's do this I'm going to
cover his skateboard with these very
sticky foil stickers that's horrible
should probably make us kickflips easier
it's like skating a plastic board that
was the flicking foot I know but I'm
gonna I'm putting these vinyl onto the
vinyl ones right here horn accidents
like a builder for you buddy it's gonna
be great it's gonna be great I try to
get it so you know sell your little
grippy areas are perfectly you know
flickable for you try to make it as not
helpful as possible pretty much doing

have strong skateboards gzhel Pete's a
bigger drill bit this better work

skateboard
