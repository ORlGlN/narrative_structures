alright guys this is an empty Dorito bag
and for some reason my kittens really
wanted Oh wasn't that just adorable you
know what my favorite thing about that
wasn't the fact that he got stuck in the
bag it was the ninja punch that he
delivered to it after he got out of it
like you punched that bag and walked
away as if you had won the battle but in
all actuality I think that you were
stuck in that Doritos bag for like
thirty seconds so explain yourself
because I'm voting on the Dorito bag
right now for the winner you got
anything to say for yourself nothing
that's what I thought
won't you go pick on a freaking Pringles
box or something I'm just kidding
Pringles on the becomin boxes subscribe
or die
