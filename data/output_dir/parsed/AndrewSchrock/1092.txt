there is not enough max Mayberry footage
on my channel so I'm really psyched that
doug said this over to me this is a max
of course doing what he does best and
that's casually destroying a skate park
or whatever is in his path but yeah Doug
and Max met up and they filmed this and
it was original Doug's channel which is
right down there the bottom link so
click that to check out more from Doug
he does awesome awesome content and then
I am the top link I do daily videos here
myself but mainly check out Doug and if
you see max tell them dude you should
skate board from the camera often sent
to andy because you're part of the
revived team and people want to see ya
hope you guys like it though check out
Doug until next time which is tomorrow
because I am done
