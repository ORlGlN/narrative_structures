alright so plain and simple that was
just good old-fashioned skateboarding
done well at a skate park in California
and all these dudes were filmed by Mason
Miller and this is from his youtube
channel which is the bottom link right
there so click that to check out more
from Mason he puts out a lot of awesome
content and he's a good dude I do daily
videos here myself so hit the toppling
for me but mainly check out Mason and
then after you do that go get some sour
patch kids ones i mean honestly when's
the last time you hacked you know you
treated yourself to some sour patch kids
I don't know maybe this morning here it
is but I'm gonna go goodbye
you
