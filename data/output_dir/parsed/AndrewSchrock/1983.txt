welcome to team bud
YouTube what's up guys so two things
really quick because this video is long
enough as is I know a million who you
guys are going to ask and answer is no
we are not accepting open sponsor
submissions just yet well for full
information you can go read below the
video but real quick summarize you know
we're just getting this company started
most of the team including myself are
still paying for skateboards like I pay
for a board I want one so we can't just
go giving a bunch of stuff away before
we've made money we would go bankrupt
and that's not good second I just want
to say shut up Facebook third I just
want to say Josh congratulations and
welcome the team it's awesome to have
you please show that Facebook you know
guys I've been watching Josh gate for
the last two years I'm seeing progressed
so much he's put a lot of work into it
and he's earned this I think he's going
to have a great place here on her bench
unfortunately do I have a lot of time to
get all mushy so maybe I'll say that
from an X F date video there's a link
down below and a link at the end of this
you should go watch some recent raw
footage that Josh posted and after that
make sure you subscribe to this channel
and that's it so cue the outro music and
I'll talk to you guys in the future boom
boom music
