alright well that was palin and his
friends over in sweden all around having
a good time on their skateboards and i
love videos like this because just
captures kind of what it's like to go
out and be a skateboarder amongst
friends you know you're always goofing
around then you haven't serious times
and you go back and forth and this
captures it awesomely so they know what
they're doing over in sweden if you want
to see more great skating mixed with
some awesome hijinks head over to
