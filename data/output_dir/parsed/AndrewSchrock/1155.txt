that's a wrap catch it whoo
47 hey guys
YouTube what's up guys so I'm gonna be
honest with you okay this is me telling
truth to your ears this video was not
supposed to exist today
I won't do an update video because I
haven't done one of those in forever
it's literally been like 17 years okay
since I've done an update video and I
went to go film to the warehouse it was
super loud it felt like b-boy building
transformers outside the warehouse like
Autobots new Transformers okay and I
couldn't film it so I did this video
instead this was the internet we are
miss 47 but a lot of people would
physically came out to my face okay
there's like face to face and they were
speaking at me and they were saying hey
that was an awesome intro you should
make its own video because it was
impressive so here it is
I hope you guys dug the outtakes and all
that it was definitely cool to put
together for an intro and maybe since
people liked it so much maybe we'll do
another one the next season we revenge
but we are a mensch 48 comes out
tomorrow I think that's the plan at
least
and then we are wrapping up filming
where image 49 so that'll be out within
like a month or so after this next we
revenge so hope you guys like that I'm
sorry for the absence of update videos
but I'll do a new one early next week
that's the plan at least I have all
these plans hopefully I don't suck at
them because I do sometimes do that Joey
say goodbye to YouTube alright
