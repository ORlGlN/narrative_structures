YouTube what is up guys this is a dark
video and you know why it's because I'm
playing him in a game of skate it's not
gonna go well I do have one shimmer of
hope he has to skin a target board I'm
gonna skate my normal board but he's one
of the best game of skate dudes that
I've ever seen in my life like it
matters but ok it this is one of the
nicer skate boards when it feels from
Target
Sam Tabor broke one of these this exact
deck on a board slide no if you break it
you lose okay and I'm not gonna feel
cool if that's the way I win but you
can't break it like how they're just
that worried about people skating it in
target which that's which I've done a
lot of times
no one did this ever stop you it didn't
know but the speed demon used to be like
a legit branch I know you were
interested in skateboarding get a real
skateboard go to go to a skate shop that
are online skate shops makers sells
actual skateboards what does that how do
you get that oh I don't know it wait
this you just leave it on well and the
whole thing's plastic oh yeah new who
needs grip team this is a nightmare I'm
living my worst nightmare I had to buy
that and I was buying a lego with it at
the same time and the girl like that
said goodbye when I was leaving and I
was like what do what I mean it told the
Lego of us for me there's spoiler alert
you go into a Lego store it's
straight-up adults that have a passion
I've never been to the Lego store No so
on for two out of three one two three
shoe yeah okay dang it I'm dead he's a
piece of monster Ollie on this thing
did you get that kinda goes first
that was the crafty
yeah that should not count I'm gonna do
that again
every time I play game escape people are
trying to convince me that I'm good
enough if I don't think I'm good enough
that should be a thing I'm doing it
again
that one surprised me
backside look
I guess O'Brien is the adopted referee
and he said do it again
it's like rattling oh it's like oh it's
like loosen the you want to tighten your
kingpin well I don't know it almost just
seems disconnected period maybe it might
just suck
I did a little nosey let's see before I
popped I was like you're writing this
right okay
ss I've got this
the wheels are sitting I think I'm gonna
just shoot out
let's
that was a miracle that's like the first
time I've done a nollie heelflip on film
I think I'm gonna lay enough Hagee three
foot one day that was like that was just
as beautiful if you had a normal board
thank you it was really good I'm just
once
like I wasn't going that slow I just
didn't roll away and he has done two
tricks today that I've never see him do
in his life he's now I've never seen an
all hear from him and I've never seen
the backside Bigfoot on the ground you
see me doodle on the hip I can do it on
the hip and all this skate park I've
seen him do on the hip not here yeah I
don't got it on this one really you're
done at night on it just making things
up and I'm making things up a nollie
heelflip but I can't do a fakie 3 flow
that's how because that I needed to do
with that
let's get K yeah that's a new record for
me my feet are gone for good
thank you yeah I can do fake it was bad
I don't know
apparently I just need to skate against
shaundalyn black on trees
I need to do a switch like I don't know
why I did I threw down not knowing what
I was gonna try Shirley was sure
how about okay see
that was a little weird I think
I'm gonna land the Swiss flip but look
at how my knees it's like they're
magnets and they can't stand each other
my knees not the trick I cannot stand
that trick that's just how I have to do
I love I love that video there's old
people they're probably gone now
you know if I you are but they're also I
have to pivot to make it roll I here's
one here's one
this is the light at the end of the
tunnel I told you this is the only way
I'd ever have a chance of beating John
Hill
I still stopped completely
t2t this is where I'd die now reason to
panic I can do this way the game goes
off this is so weird
if I land this I'm gonna give Casey ten
bucks that's how sure I'm not going to
land this although I kinda wanna give
Casey ten bus this is a good guy
that was a good game a very good game
the boy class that's good it did it
survived yeah the trucks I don't think
did I think he actually yeah you were
smoother on that board than I was on a
real yeah right I don't know a single
trick solid at all that's how I felt
about mine but his channel just popped
up right there click it he does so much
