you're the batter I want you to go over
there in the corner there's a bat and a
ball okay go get your go to use there's
a cheap bat well you're not batting I
won't go well we need a pitcher and we
need an outfielder Alex for the
outfitter L food
you're the outfielder I'll be all them
okay so go out there your job is to try
to tag him out umpire slash base layer
katie is going to go lay the basis yeah
lay it down the hello you wants the poop
to be home base work cut down right here
yeah flight one first base over there
second base somewhere over there and
then third base over there
so now only only Justin was on a
skateboard now that I think about it
because you got to get only get one home
run to pass this challenge
hey you have to grind into home on base
just a little secret you want to hit it
that's why I'm right for someone to be
able ground into home we got to do two
verse two all right it's Casey and
Justin
versus you two all right all right three
outs you guys win if anyone gets a home
run you guys win and then Kenny is a
higher
umpire yeah it's the alarm whoo Kenny
Powers yeah Justin you're the first one
because ideally you'd be the one
grinding into home ok everyone
understand the rules alright first play
first pitch
I get abate yeah you get to go I mean
that could just be oh boy oh why do I
have to know on the keyboard - yeah
today I'm not ready oh yes okay Casey
ghost on first you go back well you had
no idea what to do you didn't even get
to hit the ball that way you wanted that

just go tag him out there's two rounds
on third right because there's two
people on third you have to yeah I'm
here the bases are loaded the bases are
loaded so Lana Kirk third base I don't
know if you guys are following
everything we're talking about so he
missed the boardslide
therefore he got tagged out but he went
back to third base there was a ghost
player on that favor now Lana Kerr took
the ghost players place and two outs
