uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
geez where how's Wednesday it is
I got faced by a ball yeah we've never
done that with an intro no never not
what I like I like the this as on it
though is good this is what the harder
acting it is so hard to get hit in the
face when you know it's coming over and
over again - so whose turn is it it is
your turn it's mine
your turn yeah okay well then here have
the camera somebody today your your flat
bar man today I've been skating flat bar
so that's good that's good some beers
they're gonna warm up with five tricks
on the flat bar and then mr. challenge I
have no idea what challenge I have no
idea it's gonna be no clue all right and
then we're gonna mate we're gonna set up
this ridiculous rail situation okay you
have 12 minutes if you boards to light
it it's like a gap tre like what that
says nothing I don't know we don't know
yet I don't know I don't know so I'm
gonna have to do a rail situation you're
gonna have the board slide it if you
cannot boardslide that you're going to
be drinking a spicy drink that we do but
boat but bonus gonna do it out here and
you're doing your boxers you can get
past that and make it to the front board
in the same 12 minutes Thomas is gonna
do sing and dance and do a song for you
oh really singing again let's see the
best reward I could have again you've
done this oh yeah yeah well I haven't
seen you dance though that mean I hope I
do it amazingly I made it to the entire
spiel without you interrupting me why
would I interrupt how would I interrupt
you honestly like there's some weird
spots right there like an animal came by
let's go little Pete I know I talked to
my cells you should probably watch the
intro hey can I pick my flat bar no what
why I was excited that the answer be yes
well just keep the red one terrible
like no I don't want you to skate that
one dumb race - but yeah we're just keep
the round I'm gonna drop it down it's
new it's fun
five trick straight oh I was a listening
this whole time Brian's never here
you said five tricks right okay five
from blunt to regular which I did that I
usually do to go to fakie I was going to
go hard on you in here legitimate tricks
and you were starting off honorable I
appreciate that
I tried to be I'm gonna have fun isn't
this the warm-up it is the world but
yeah but you come out here some front
board gonna be like now
that was a quite proper boom two in a
row
kickflip front and board he says rap
that was good perfect
no hellos now in those boys
proper proper proper what's for this deu
is like those months should be like that
it's an ollie Meadows blood it's a warm
up fourth trick I don't think I can do
he is making it hard on himself he's
gonna go for knowing nosegrind not easy
in round rail
that's big spin front board the right
the right way
I've never seen him do that trick before
that's good he's a dumb person for
trying to do it and there's a warm-up
because it's hard I think it should be a
role that if you're sweating this much
at the end of the warm-up you just don't
win I think you're sweating that much
after the warm-up you've warmed up
oh yeah but I'm like I'm hot I'm too
warm you're not too warm you're perfect
anyways I've set up a trick shot we're
keeping in the holiday theme here it's
Halloween time so yesterday was
Halloween when this goes up yesterday

week for us I'm gonna make him do trick
shot pumpkin off of the trampoline into
the garbage can you can fall okay

good mr. chance for for him next time

time what is the challenge you'll make
this Flyway

Nikki that doesn't work that's not gonna
work boiler alert from Ford is not
happening that would be insane I guess I
don't lose anything no if it doesn't I
really want to see him dance though what
do you get if you want if you do this I
would just have a pat on the back
like I just I don't have to I have to
give I don't water slide I have to be in
my boxers in the field and drink hot
sauce it's impossible front board oh
gosh I have you boardslide it at the
baby boy slide round one lip slide round
two it's not possible from wow I want to
try from work
get your magneto boards on 12 minutes
and three seconds
bonus three seconds starting
I'm gonna rebuild that rail if it is aa
bit more than half of the way and it's
been paused for 30 seconds to drive 30
seconds yes it's fun you should do this
no it's fun I will not do this since
terrifying yeah you're gonna have to
like fly at it it's scary to go fast
it looks cool
I bet you wish the round one can be at
the end what I bet you wish the round
one can be at the end yeah it's weird
going flaps around 2 flat 2 round flat 2
round round round round flat around
it's so hard he needs to just go fast
yeah that's all this that's all it is
you can do it ever try this this is so
hard
alright I'm pausing it right now halfway
down six minutes exactly look like
there's like I don't I feel like I'm in
a different planet great when I get here
so do you tax it more no pausing five
minutes and 50 seconds what happens now
I'd literally just it just I was the
right standing I just stood up and I was
there the stars aligned what was hard so
what happens from 40 the Delian you
trying to punch your face
I'm not gonna lie he's getting way
farther than I thought he's gotta get I
even think it better from
and he said he was like motivated
because he want Thomas to do this and
Thomas is like I was hoping you guys
would forget and I'm like why would we
forget it you would have to do two and a
half minutes left he's gold it
good breath I was thinking about Thomas
the whole time I'll clean it up my
problems Rob its chances of him landing
that to me where zero didn't even get a
chance and he just did that that wasn't
you just have faith that you couldn't
stand on a skateboard and you'll job and
it minute and a half left about
super-president yeah I did not the board
side I feel like was harder because when
I finally just committed to the pro
board I did did you forget that Thomas
had to dancing south still aa reason why
I had the energy to commit you didn't
forget that you had to dance you know
throughout that I was on a V all right
