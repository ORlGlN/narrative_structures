where is it all right here just hey hey
YouTube what's up guys I'm back at
Beechmont park with this small tiny
skateboard when I did a setup video with
this last time I was trying to 540 flip
but I ran out of time okay
time you know when you're sitting in
school when you see that the the hands
let's go up hands but they're really
just sticks in space that it's time all
right I get written at a time now I have
more time and I'm gonna try to lay in
the 540 flip so I'll warm up and I'll
show you the tricks that do warming up
but uh I'm in a battle and I'm sore and
it's windy because it's always windy at
this park but I've done way too much
talking so let's get the skateboard Greg
is gonna be nice enough to film okay pop
test okay
I'll switch sides I don't even know I
gotta keep with this I'm just gonna do a
kickflip I was like this dude I'm like
this is my day on this board right now
geez I swear this board gets smaller
every time I skated here it is this foot
where Phil will ferrel this is where the
real will fill wherever he is I'm
leaving but I'm on it
I was gonna make you do a trick for this
video man he's interrupting my warmup
which by now is on a warm-up because
I've been trying the backs of him for
like 15 tries he's gonna do two tricks
before he leaves
that was pretty impressive dude hit that
hard it's not easy is it no it's done
all true donkey snoring funs a game
sound all Lucky Charms okay not always
sitting a toast crunch oh that was
perfect was cuz we were singing into the
song and the camera me and Hamish rock
I'm all sweaty now doing some promise
stuff oh wow okay yeah no I feel so
wrong even the three club is amazing huh
yeah that one was really good really I'm
glad I waited oh yeah okay now I gotta
go thank you for seeing hugging me sing
hug and so wipe my sweat on you yeah
that was a look at me and up the thing
here's my hand no look at me
no look at me let's try this again
so I'm gonna do the tries I'm going to
try the 540 flip and the hardest thing
about this Bank is that it's rounded
clearly skateboarders didn't build the
skatepark girls they would never put a
round top you know you want like a crisp
but I'll deal with it and I'll try to
we'll see what I can do I'm freaking I'm
out of weight out of breath why do I say
wait I always felt so good and then I
just was not on my skateboard I want
some blue moon when I turned my ankle
and that's exactly what just happened
how long have you see it in the footage
but wow that like really went 90 degrees
once again I failed with the 540 flip so
that bad but I don't want to it doesn't
feel good
so I'm gonna I'm gonna film Craig to do
some tricks if you would like to and
then I'll have to come back once again
to do this dumb 540 foot I've done it on
flat ground if that counts
now I'm just making excuses my stupid
legs that do not work right now we're
gonna film Craig my hand works out
looking like this videos a lot of the
fisheye doesn't sing justice it's big
did it first try now
he almost ate it on the hip he was
looking at me he's like no I'll do it
again and he hit the kid the corner of
the hip and all as well I shouldn't be
telling the story Wow
