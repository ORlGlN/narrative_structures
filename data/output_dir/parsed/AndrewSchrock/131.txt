take over the world
sophomore skate video and also I hope
you enjoy dramatic lighting cuz we got
it going on a couple things want to
share with you about this part one
there's a funny clip that you may have
seen where I introduced myself to Luis
Mora and it clearly never heard of him
before that was a very very old clip and
he had actually just started his YouTube
channel back then and he was interning
for Nigel Alexander so he was just on
the scene and you know it's crazy how
far he's come because he's killing it
these days so there's a really crazy
throwback clip their second huge time
range in this part started filming in
2013 when I was a senior in high school
and a lot of the clips are from Boston
or a few of them and a few of the clips
are from Boston I took this what was
vaguely disguised as a college tour but
naturality it was me skating and
partying with all my college friends and
getting some clips which was awesome and
third thing I'm really really hyped on
how international this part is Paris
Puerto Rico Florence Barcelona and of
course a bunch of US states from North
Carolina to California to everywhere I
took a bunch of road trips so I'm really
so to have a part that's kind of all
over the place I'm super proud of it and
yeah it's definitely my best skating to
date except for the new footage I'm
sitting on for battle stations the third
revive video so yeah it is a huge honor
to get to ride for revive and Andy thank
you so much for for posting this and
letting me be a part of all this anyway

so much for watching actually I should
probably let Andy conclude Andy say
goodbye to everyone goodbye
so before watching this full clip of
Josh I recorded like an intro or outro
or something of me talking and then I
realized he talked during it so I didn't
need it that's my story but I knew got
this little basketball shot thing going

yeah I can do it that hurt to flick a
golf ball
