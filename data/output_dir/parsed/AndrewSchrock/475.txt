you skate tighter trucks yes you're
gonna regret that that's just the right
way to do it take tighter moody I'm to
tell you there's no good way to do it if
you have an opinion that's crazy
so I saw you do a line there so they
want you to do so the warm-up davon
Iranian get it on the warm-up okay you
got you bud yeah you guys both got to do
five tricks okay any tricks anywhere
for any reason and then you got to do
your line you're gonna have let's say
we'll say seven seven minutes to do your
line Ali impossible up and then three
foot down the three if you land that you
get $15 which is more than 14 and then
we're gonna loosen your trucks up okay I
guess we'll try this either way even if
you fail at it you still have to try it
with Lu structures that's the point of
this you guys if you do it again with
loose trucks you get another 15 how long
