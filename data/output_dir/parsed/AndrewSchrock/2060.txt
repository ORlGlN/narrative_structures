up and we're warmed up right now
and here is a Tropicana orange juice
bottle I'm gonna go throw it at Alex
midair I still hit you midair dude got
me good that's what's up guys so we're
gonna go skateboard today and it's like
22 degrees outside and a lot of people
when we when they hear us complaining
about like the weather or a spot or
something they're like oh
least you have a spot or oh it's like
negative 50 degrees here you don't don't
complain it's like you know what I'm
allowed to complain because say I broke
my arm and then my friend went and broke
his arm a lot worse than me I'm still
allowed to complain about my broken arm
you still have a broken arm you know
that's ridiculous so I know we're
grateful that we have spots to skate and
that is not negative 50 but it's still
cold and it sucks and dude put a jacket
on go put at least the hoodie look what
are you talking about dude are you
smoking something no I'm not I'm not I'm
messing with you put your board in the
trunk and let's go I was gonna ollie up
the pardon curve and I was like that's
not happening
watch
dang dude and is trying to find a new
spot for us but I think we're just gonna
drive forever you're gonna drive forever
now we're really I think we are gonna
drive forever all right what's up guys
we are at the new town benches and let's
see what Alex has to offer
he's got a cookie grind porn attack Oh
missed haha
little does he know that I'm gonna throw
a rock at him
these benches are like shoulder-high on
Jase
what oh alright here's the story
he's been trying I don't know what he's
been trying weird stuff and I randomly
filmed him in a fakie 5050 big spin out
or something what was that big spit out
give me a high five yeah it was good I
don't care I don't care at all all right
you guys rock today hey bud thank you hi
myself kind of skated like a squirrel
with a broken leg but uh you know be a
lot better though this is this we want
revenge just kind of missing something
you know who that is
it's max Mayberry all right max may vary
so uh let's just imagine he's back for
the holidays and we're filming him at
Ollie's all right down for that we're
gonna imagine that let's get that out of
my face dude all right all right what's
up guys so we're at Ali's skate park and
Wes has joined us we won't revenge 11
and the park got a new rail let's see
what Alex has to offer on it
nothing what are you gonna hey max max
your friggin back yeah what else first
riding
what
you you
how do you feel about that
ah double wammy double I don't have a
head anymore what I don't have a head
anymore hope that doesn't have to make
sense anyone my shoelace already ramp
videos over second days
let's go hug max goodbye and a lot of
you guys didn't see that would coming
that's because we were not planning on
doing it we want revenge this winter but
max is back in town flick week or two
and we had some dry weather and I was
like alright what the heck we have got
to do this so we just winged it and the
street skinning kind of came out and
because it was like 20 degrees outside
and for all you Celsius people out there
that is below zero so it was really cold
our bodies were like frozen stiff
in fact my skating the whole entire
video is kinda and I was behind the
camera most the time but uh you know I
just wasn't on when I was in front of
the camera skating so why should go down
there and give this video a thumbs up to
bring back the warm weather and so we
can do some more impressive tricks for
you but uh I was really psyched on all
the guys skating they did they shred it
as usual and I really want to see Wes
hit that Krueger on the back lip because
that rails not long it's kind of short
and I was really impressed that he was
even sticking at that solid so uh maybe
you will see that here in the future but
rock on max is going back to Arizona so
make sure you wish him a safe journey
and I would like to point out that no
Alex's were harmed in the making this
video that was the magic sub editing
guys to a hero of chapstick hey Alex Wow
tape Wow
heck I can throw nothing exactly
so on that note subscribe or ow
really
you
