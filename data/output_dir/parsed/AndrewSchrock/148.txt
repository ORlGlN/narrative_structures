warm up to get warm okay even though
it's very warm out here you only need
two super hot and it's really hot or
where else right now anyways and that

three insane obstacles that you're what
we're going to create three deadly
obstacles and you have to survive and if

bucks if you don't I have no idea if you
yeah if you don't you're gonna be hurt
beard now we're not gonna like baseball
about your legs or anything like it's
not like that it's not a threat no or
maybe is it it could be you agree I
agree
we have you one of these it's pretty
much that up that challenge is not to
die pretty much but you do it with
flying flags of colors let's go awesome
hey will you drink out of there hey a
door I wish you could reverse kick it
open hey why is it foggy with you it
looks so weird like we're in a dream
right now so there are no rules with
warming up okay but you have to impress
him so he could say no do a better trick
okay so I can take my time and build
something yeah you take your time I mean
I want to let me check my bracelet yeah
I don't want to be here for like two
hours but right now sure yeah
proved checkmark he's gotta do two more
he does did you see that I did the tyre
is fun
one thing that I've been meaning to do
that you should do is kind of we just
did you should grind and then ollie onto
it and roll out yeah
all right so it starting to grind to no
comply roll out he's crazy
that's weird everything every shot looks
like it's in a tree-like because all
this I'll bid to dry ice in there
on a scale from one to ten eleven
sanely good that was very good she's Oh
Pete's he's putting on top of the ramp
interesting oh my gosh like that please
do that and don't don't hit Doug and
Aaron over here yes scary not unless I
hit my head on I know what he's doing
and you did it first try thumbs up
amazing absolutely he wants to do
another trick that's insane
I didn't that was good it was such an
honest appreciation right there since
your warm-up was amazing and your main
challenge is risky you got a very easy
mr. challenge you just have to try to
juggle three skulls even if you can't
juggle and I hope you can't because then
it'll be fucking amazing yeah well one
of the dudes the stage tough at Ollie's
with the clown College before I was
juggling balls all the time so I - it's
so big and hard I just forget how to
start get to one hand right don't break
them no I'm kidding I mean they're
already dead I think you're supposed to
start with the one that's in two hands
yeah like I can juggle I just don't
think about it so you throw this one up
and then throw this one and then you
catch that one with that hand and you
just keep the cycle going or just try to
throw in the air and make it happen okay
that didn't count faced that was good
that was really good
very you see that was appropriate is
October that's good yeah one skulls and
we're gonna flip this around so he's
gonna grind drop down and grind up this
okay I understand that's part of the
thing no no that's that's amazing we
wanted the tip right dude yeah
terrifying
come on he's excited for I like this
okay yeah that is fun
he wants to go slow enough that he hits
that and has the time to adjust balance
to make it it's uphill it's also
backside right well yeah but to make it
uphill as the party's gonna get harder
look at the lead sake how it looks you
get your tea kettle out no I'm good
all right whenever you go is when he
starts the clock six minutes of skating
or like when we're moving stuff around
it doesn't count
oh yeah Oh is it scary not really he
like yeah you just face that he must
ramp fearlessly he doesn't need six
minutes he needs like six tries I just
touched your boob
you want to five-o it yeah
you're done I'm gonna go get a seatbelt
for him you saw the seatbelt it needs
one that's Gary
gosh that was good I like this I think I
want to do it one more time before we do
the fun alley okay
so let's drag this over there oh yes
so you're gonna have to do the kind of
reverse thing ollie up grind take it
down and grind okay I think it'll tip
faster because the most of the weight is
over there or you know or like vice
versa dude if he falls forwards gonna
suck yeah goodbye advances space
Armageddon clock stay back on okay okay
whenever you're ready man
first truck I know it did scare me
though when he didn't lock in I was I
was really scared
oh my god that was a quick one
whoa Shh
so he almost died and my camera just
shut off that's I think in my panic I
like hit the button or something that
sucks that was crazy
oh I like the we got a bonus I was
tricked out there I like it just trying
to make it through that was good the
same okay so off time he wants to do a
bonus trick he wants to tailslide of it

way better I got a quick fakie heelflip
