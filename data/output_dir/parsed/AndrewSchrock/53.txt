horrified and I feel like if I clip I'll
actually die I'll be a dead person I do
three tricks I can take a wonderful
manual know it's got a manual it's gonna
be three manuals Ringo three manuals
yeah he wants all interred is this off
clock yes it is off line
this first coming up with a death manual
goes I think we nailed it oh yes
I'm just you know I haven't pressed I
don't know if you do three manuals
all right as soon as you go he opens up
the Tabasco sauce and it's game on game
on that was scary yes it was scary in
between thought processes this is a
thing so he's got six minutes and five
seconds what he had six minutes to start
all right Brian six was 18 seconds oh
wow okay he's getting way too playful
with his extra time it's the next trick

seconds left he's got some time you've
been causing so much letting him rest
no I have nothing that what he's gonna
go over there dilly dally was he going
for mani 180 I think I think he can do
it too you think he might be on to
something but that you know if any idea
how good that trick would be it would be
pretty cool
that would be so hard I would rather
like build a street spot for you to do
that we have we have a panel of judges
over here he wants it he chooses to he
knows many of us that's it that's it 2
minutes and 43 42 to knows management

tries left too chewy

motivation landed
