YouTube what is up guys I have a Walmart
skateboard right here and I'm an escaped
what about today I'm gonna see how many
tricks I can do on this before I break
it I did a video a couple weeks ago and
that where we skated a little bit and
then we just physically destroyed the
thing which was fun that was fun maybe
you want to make this video and actually
see how much this can take before it
stops being it would be skateable so
let's open this up and talk about it and
then we're gonna skateboard on it
weaving let's open up the skateboard
yeah that's the not art it first off you
shouldn't have to open up a seat or
maybe the deck you know the deck should
come shrink-wrap to the first but by the
time you grip it plastic should never go
back on your city board look they how do
they do this this would be so hard to do
they put the plastic on and then they
put the hardware on that's it makes
sense take David gripped board they put
the plastic on least they're trying to
keep your wheel screen no they're trying
to leave skate it and try to get that
off oh you got to take you get dude
there's way too many steps like you go
to a skate shop the way you're supposed
to and by a skate work you get a
skateboard you're gonna walk outside and
skate it ya know go to Walmart my
skateboard which don't do that you walk
outside you got like basically Xindi set
up your skateboard this it's an
experience should I go get you a tool
we're gonna need it eventually sure yeah
okay I just put myself on it gosh would
you whatsoever first ride right here I
like how you're filming with coffee by
the way all right
very terrible I got here one push no
that's good do this first try maybe
maybe okay Oh Oh
makes you feel like the worst Gabler
alright so what are we doing burial
annex Mira here's a trick that you
can absolutely only do it at Walmart now
you can do gnarly bores the ballerina
alright let's go
a new flat spot the wheels already it's
comes from that thing I think it sounded
oh you did I did one-oh it's there I
could one ballerina I could one
ballerina oh I did it I did it
yeah do you dream of this yeah I got
this suit
take it mm-hmm
I thought I was going to see a skit
rebel beginning right but it's meetings
you're not metal on plastic oh maybe
aggress great let's give this look juice
no I would never ever try a slide on
this board that whacks him first
coffee break
true story I one time owned a baby
giraffe true story I lied about the
first story what happened there I'm a
real life there's no rules and I'm not
rolling away from this hey do you
remember that brand no rules
it's so it's so awkward because you get
on your you're rolling it is the worst
thing ever and then you get on and the
slide feels real going at a normal
momentum and then you get back on the
ground you're like all this again is it
actually grinding this is dangerous
does it work though like it's the girl
crying it does grind so we will give
plastic trucks that is there's a mark
oh my gosh I want to thank nobody that
mean I just want to thank anyway that's
just a heath hurt or thing oh yeah he
did that not to rub it in or anything
but I just grew around this that's a
good coke it's good you never ever can
mess up talking without friends make a
deal better now it's always a big deal
what was that
gentle attempt at a hard blow that's
what hard clubs for me look like I'm
real boards though shine oh great
kickflip fakie on the bank you do that
all the time I don't know about this you
got it this see he's trying to kick them
to fakie on the bank this is you be
interesting
listen impressive first try
even breaks my board I'll be so mad but
my board oh that was just he rolled away
Mikey look he's still mad well not
really anymore
all right no slug box no slide to show
how you do it we ready we're gonna keep
it rolling and let me say something
did not slide Oh Walter well I push
really hard and he loosened the bolts
you seen baby miles worth
that's what JLo just said Eddie yeah
she's on a wrecking ball right
you wear I just waxed the wrong thing
that was tough dude you have to try
three times as hard with Walmart or
unneeded ly trying to get on the stairs
it rolls so much better on the wood you
know the the gooey stuff in Mario and
you get any walks love I tried to fail
and I actually almost wrote it away
look how sweaty idea
oh my gosh this is terrible so I'm gonna
try to three flip it but first Manali
the five
sad easy but then a kickflip is hard to
roll away from I have never felt like I
can slip out and smash any part of my
body more than I do right now Chinese
I am impressed I give all credit that
land to my hand touch how do I got it
done without just a big round I'm so
worn out double flip
let's see it doesn't bring going down
the stairs and when I fool try a flat
ground double flip over there it snaps
complaining take the worst of the
beating do down the stairs now the
series was falling behind on stairs the
trucks take all the beating and you even
get it on film I'm not do another one of
these videos look this is the most
frustrating road if I do another Walmart
war video it'll be different
let this be a reminder to you that these
are not safe skateboards ok there's
actually a weight limit like I'm totally
not supposed to be riding this clearly
by the trucks but it's not safe these
are not quality bearings if they're even
our bearings I don't know what they are
they're chunks of plastic all this stuff
it's just you could get hurt because
it's not meant for actual tricks on
skateboards so if you're looking to get
into skateboarding oh than just rolling
down the driveway on your butt go to
your local skate shop and get a real
skateboard I know they're way more
expensive than these but you know do
some chores shoveled lawns mowed rive
ways do whatever it takes and support
you know an actual skate shop you don't
have a skate shop I do have an online
skate shop but wherever your money goes
make sure it goes back to actual
skateboarding and uh not other places
but if you like this give this video a
thumbs up and I new daily videos here so
hit the subscribe button if you want to
see more from me and I will see you
tomorrow
I'm gonna go skate on a real board I
hope it's not shocked shocking like oh
it actually rolls
counseling I do this first try I'm gonna
give you five bucks Justin okay what I
meant mess it up he owes me one
that doesn't count
that does not how that counts me five
bucks
