now that is board control that is Johnny
Geiger and it's kind of the Santa Claus
of skateboarding to be honest with you I
mean like he is a session and then he
brings you presents and then you open it
up it's a half-cab late flip down a set
of stairs I'm sorry who does that if you
want to check more Johnny out click the
bottom link and you'll love his channel
he has even more insane skateboarding I
do daily videos myself so click the top
link if you're not subscribed to me but
mainly check Johnny outs ok and i am
going to start talking in a action hero
esque voice and the music will cut me
off momentarily and then well i will be
fishing I
you
