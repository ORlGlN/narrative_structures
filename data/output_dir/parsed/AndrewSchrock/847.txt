ah ugly
well if you needed another reason to
like fabien there it is it has to be a
world record that was ridiculous and it
looked like you could just keep going to
like like endless skateboard combo yeah
that was Fabien if you like what you saw
you better check out his channel it's
the bottom link he does me like he's one
of the most talented skateboarders I've
seen with my own eyes skate he's awesome
and he's really down to earth nice dude
I do daily videos here myself so click
the top lane for me but mainly check out
Fabien somebody L&R somebody getting
measuring tape and get his book of world
records in here though that was insanity
that's it I'm done
check out Fabien good bye Cat Cat why do
