let's just land this
YouTube I feel like we should have an
honest relationship again right now I've
got a complete into UK I had the idea
for this video like six months ago
and I've just been putting it on the
back burner and I was like you know I'll
make it someday
and then finally six months later or
seven or eight or a hundred who knows
how many months nobody can actually know
the video is out okay here we are
oh yeah I got this idea and I want to do
it and I'm finally I finally done it and
I'm gonna be honest I wish this box was
taller it's only ten inches tall
stony we got in the park so we make do
with it but when you go to an actual
street ledge you're like this is a
little bit taller than I'm used to is on
yeah because the box of the part is ten
inches tall but I'm thankful to even
have a box of skate and I have learned
quite a few tricks on that and the best
thing about this is that I'm not even
done yeah I'm gonna learn so many more
tricks in this box so I look forward for
more and go down to give this video a
thumbs up if you wanna see around to one
day in five years from now when I've
done another thirty tricks on it or
whatever but I hope you guys dug this
video I'll be back tomorrow and the next
day on the next day the next day with
more randomness skating or whatever I
come up with because their daily videos
so subscribe if you're already not and
on my way out so what do you say when
you're scared
some of you got that out there and for
those of you who did you are awesome
