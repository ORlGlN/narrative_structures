wait audio that was really weird how the
world broke for a second what was that I
don't know what's today

Wednesday yeah okay this actually so
it's been two years since we've had snow
it's so bright it's also like zero
degrees which what is that in Celsius
okay I don't know negative like 15 like
that Brackins going today
Brackins going today Bracken yeah all
right warm up you have to do three
tricks don't care if they are doom
anywhere you want go anywhere for any
reason after that you're gonna do three
bottle shit you're gonna do three
chi-gong trick shots you are a trickshot
guy that's what you do look at your face
and you're gonna prove that you can do
trick shots okay get up two ways then
you're gonna attack the hip to hip
attack you have to do tricks on the hip
you seven of them we're gonna give you
bearings you have ten minutes to do said
tricks if you do ten tricks you're gonna
get bearings and you're gonna get wheels
if you do not do either of these things
you're not gonna like it but if you can
accomplish it you might get a secret
punishment on Brian - oh maybe your
punishment will be dealt is the point
okay okay let's do it
all right it is really cold it's I think
it's zero degrees outside it was
negative five and I was driving to work
yeah that's what I'm not holding my
skateboard my hands before hey you guys
got big bubbly jackets your mom would be
so proud I feel like Christmas right now
yeah it feels so much better to be
inside like I could feel like my hands
and come back to life it's like that
Evanescence song like in our warehouse
is bringing us back to life don't say
that you think you're gonna be able to
move your skateboard like after coming
out of the cold yeah
people 50 the rails a hand rule the long
room yeah black just just a warm up the
blackjack yeah how many times do you
think he's gonna try before he lands it
he's gonna try it once and then do the
second track do you think so
he doesn't even move does he
you might be right Wow
oh you western stallion I fell out there

mrs. wheezy be super hyped on you have
shoot that was good
two more tricks although you're probably
warm already um I think maybe like a
front flip on that me Graham what's he
doing right his front feet crook I'm
gonna film it like it's 2002 he asked me
to film not as close so it's not gonna
look like it's from 2002 I think I was
actually the problem one more trick
kickflip manual job knows man you can

you've got to do you got to do some
trick shots okay blasts blasts that with

wheels and bearings no Ollie's or 180s
like half cabs no it's a 187 minutes and
12 seconds he's 10 minutes I'm giving
them 10 minutes and 12 I'll just say you

bright side if he fails you get to the
secret that was pretty that was very
good well what's the damage he's got

guard he is took it out no no it's
pulling back he's no that's not how this
