how many things have you done 1000 times
your life I've lived 1000 days pretty
sure you have to and if you haven't you
probably understand what I'm saying
right now I probably had 1,000 tacos I
like to think that I would hit 1,000 she
pull at burritos in my lifetime but
1,000 YouTube videos not a lot of people
get to that point okay and that means
I've been making videos for a long time
now Ben years and I don't know if a lot
of people are expecting some crazy thing
from me but I'm gonna do two videos the
first being what I do every single time
I hit up 100 mark on my channel and that
is show you a recap of the last 100
videos on my channel and that is gonna
happen in a moment but later today I'm
gonna do a video of just talking about
my five top videos that I've done here
in my channel I'll give you links to
watch them so once again you guys are
the best I can't thank you enough for
watching my videos like I you know I'd
be doing this for myself because I love
to do it but knowing that you guys watch
it and are entertained by me acting like
an idiot on the camera that is priceless
