YouTube what is up guys I have a new
idea for a video maybe serious I don't
know so I'm really excited for it I have
eggs and I'm gonna make people skate
with it while holding in their hand and
seeing if they can do enough tricks or
whatever it may be a time limit without
breaking the egg let's do this
Alex commuting what do I have here looks
like a half dozen egg and a friend
I'm afraid that's you I've got eggs and
you and I'm gonna make you skate holding
one of these in your hand and if you do
it for ten minutes doing tricks the
entire time you get you get $15 to
Chipotle which is the greatest gift
anyone can give anyone will ease here
for no reason but you dude you want to
warm up for a second just like to do
that yeah I'll hold the props yeah free
rein you just got to be honorable about
it okay it's ten minutes I have my
stopwatch guy right here and you have to
do it you can't do the same trick okay
twice oh cool oh this is a new idea I'm
really excited to go down there yeah
boom high drop that's ready that's it oh
no no surprise it's an egg it's gonna
break how do we clean it I don't know
what gets another card all right
the picking of the egg my dude what to
pick how about this one
perfect all right okay look it around
make sure that the one you want is a
great a large egg if you drop it it
doesn't break you get to keep going okay
okay what do I don't land any tricks but
you have a break if I can't do it one
trick in ten minutes then you're gonna
do something new yeah okay yeah you're
you lose all your sponsors if you don't
land a trick I probably will what is
your first art obstacle the box okay you
can I'm gonna be not liberal with it and
commit skateboarding manual I'm calling
it yeah you ain't Rick you're good
stress is over he's rocking it so far
yes
Oh scary it is when you start to almost
die think of other things I was trying
to think of other things I can make them
hold like a cake okay don't drop the
cake do that video Oh where'd you want
to go I can feel these things hip hip
hop I suck you're like really good at
this aren't you eight minutes exactly
you got eight minutes dude oh my gosh
that was risky Wow
it's been seven half minutes that's
pretty good dude I would be so mad if he
dropped it off camera like casually over
there I can see that I could I can
totally see you totally good at this
this video is just like he's unbeatable
we're gonna make you do it again with
two eggs like one in each hand so he's
got left a 640 left the worst would be
falling down and smash get it into your
hand or body that'd be terrible pulling
on to it or actually throwing it across
the park and it hit somebody
AP's hips they're like so vague when
they built this oh if I ever really need
to bestow something upon somebody to
keep it safe I think you're my guy that
was not the proper use of the stove
right kind of it that is a dude what
time we got 450 - all right you got four
minutes and 52 seconds prob yeah
what next they do that left and the
whole thing all right please do that
I might break if you do break it I get
15 dollars of the Chipotle so I'm happy
with that
well no it's stupidly easy yes Beck's I
put the stairs or something
do you 180 out on this one did you grab
because he would smash the egg don't
break yourself eating the quarter that
was the wrong hand oh my gosh you did it
yeah nobody the stairs you're jumping on
these
