this is terrifying we are playing a game
of skate where Brian Ames gets to shoot
us with a nerf bazooka
that's where did you find it I don't
know I don't think it hurts as much as
just like it's a big ball flying at you
when you're doing a trick it's terrible
I fight it's a decent dog it's a dog toy
dude look it is yeah that's what it says
nerf dog
yeah see so he's even loaded oh it's
loaded that's terrifies we're looking
down then it says never look down the
barrel because you could blast your face
off so it's me versus Alex and Brian
gets to shoot us he's going for the
Wiener don't I don't I mean literally
the first few trees I'm trying holding
my wiener no eyeballs no broken noses
the only only wiedersehen only rule okay
let's see who goes for attacks yes No
I don't want to be the first so I'm just
like that was shooting union he got get
over there
there's no way we'll get used to it but
the first five tricks are getting
terrible it's gonna be great fun Alex
I guess you'd be the referee that was
too sketchy you almost hit me in the
face are you going for the face Alex has
s much fun great time
paranoid because I feel like we like
ducked down you're gonna hit me in the
nose like with my head you're aiming and
my face will just go where my wiener was
that was a bad thing to say
he shoots really late on Alex
we have been another pop it's like
amazing how much of a ball you turn into
let's get a cold duty
and such
that's it that's a good trick because
anything 180 is he's odds he's likely to
hit in the side sorry he's just our
aiming for feet like didn't I kick flip
the other way like I try to kick Floyd
you he'll flip the board now he's DK
okay
I'm an ass I haven't nollie heelflip to
know in a year or six months I don't
know definitely I gonna do it with a
ball flying towards my face right
stomach stomach
who's that switch shove it what a dumb
prick k2k
and hit the board
I have a new strategy new strategy I'm
gonna go for the foot I can't
switch foot jeez
c√≠mon game harder
they can move the board sorry I can't
believe I landed that I haven't landed
one of those in like two years
Wow
I am at a this is amazing
you just landed a hardflip getting hit
in the face with a bazooka it's true
sorry
then mean in face I'm a tea I have to
give up the stupid switch look good very
good like the way I was doing the trick
I've no idea
you've got it into my groin region
growing vocab word of the day
that's the Andhra I'm dead I'm never
doing this trick in my life got it
already do I look at it
do it again okay little sloppy he's for
his foot came off I would have died
oh god I almost killed him
I almost murdered him
you can even though in though the thigh
bone the thigh meat like that I'm gonna
leave the fat felt like in a woman feel
again they look like a him during the
week
