you too there you guys go hope you guys
like that little montage what happens is
when I edit it we are avenged I have a
lot of extra clips that didn't end up in
the video because they were sloppy or
they're just they just didn't fit
properly so they go into either a bonus
clip video on my channel which I've
already uploaded or it goes to a scrap I
caught scraps over on Alex Channel it's
just unused Clips what you just saw is
the first batch of some scrap clips that
were on Alex's channel um so if you want
to stay up to date with these definitely
check out Alex channel because when I do
what we want revenge you know he has one
up relatively soon
showing unused footage so his channel is
right down there
make sure you check it out and also he's
avoiding a lot of interesting funny
videos all the time he does daily the
video so it's a channel you want to be
subbed to but I have one more batch of
these of not all the ones that are on
our channel but I just like kinda like
the best of for these videos coming out
in the future so you'll get another
batch just like this I didn't leave it
here myself so click the subscribe if
you wanna see more for me but mainly
check out Alex down there and that is it
