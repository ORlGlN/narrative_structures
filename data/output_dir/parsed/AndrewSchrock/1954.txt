it is raining right now I fell into a
puddle on my first go the lady didn't
look and I'm icing everywhere and in the
footage I look 40 pounds heavier than I
am because I'm wearing two sweatshirts a
t-shirt and two pairs of Polly
jolly Holly let's do another one already
this cake is like fights back it's like
hard like I'm pushing on it like a punch
to the face alright let's do it
that's not even it really didn't fight
back there's like a face print in it so
guys we only had 20 minutes to do this
all right when it's raining but I had to
do a Christmas video for you so I
dressed up and really awkward Christmas
clothes and I found this so next year
hopefully it'll be a little nicer
weather or snowing or something festive
but I'm out of here guys hope you guys
have a Merry Christmas or whatever you
celebrate with that said punch dude
I think it's got knocked out
icing on my car dude alright guys here's
the demo of this shit I I like I didn't
clean my face off fast enough barely and
this stuff's not coming off unless I
take a shower
we're gonna have to stop caring okay I'm
done caring I'm gonna go out there about
four cakes my face let's just like
bear our let's go
