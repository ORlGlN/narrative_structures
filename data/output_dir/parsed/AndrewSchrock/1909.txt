all right guys so I'm house-sitting my
uncle and aunt's house is sweet which is
awesome because they have a crazy dog
Rita who's insane and I love hanging out
with her
give me your blanket give me your
blanket Rita oh but what gets me is he
left me this note
Andy thanks for watching the house I
love your videos but please don't ever
do a music video because it would be
horrible
don't even try you know what Uncle Bill
I'm gonna do a music video in your own
house how about that one that's going
down right now
boom take that Uncle Bill we're out
really run you just sit there and hog
all the camera time live it up you
supposed to walk away in slow motion hey
I think your uncle was right that was
pretty stupid
want to see the unveiling of the
eyeballs he's asleep that's the only way
we could get this shot you're cute
