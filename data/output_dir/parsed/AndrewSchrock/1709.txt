okay that was probably the weirdest
thing I've done in one of these end of
video kitchen scenes but that was Doug
desert ELLs and you guys most likely
know him if you do not you need to go
check out his channel or it'll be right
down there in the info and then at the
end of this video click it watch this
stuff and subscribe because he's one of
those talented skateboards in the world
and he's probably the most talented
skateboarder named Doug in the world
like literally like he is so good so
check that out and if you don't I'm
going to throw a big bouncing ball at
you in fact I'm gonna do it anyways so
you better get clicking okay camera Phil
