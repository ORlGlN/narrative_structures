so I was messing around with this trick
though did the skatepark and I haven't
done one in years and when I landed it
decently I was like you know what I
should just make a video of this because
I don't think anyone's seen me do a
kickflip noseslide on YouTube so there
it is her because Doug that the feature
video right there is another episode of
life with pard Regas this one is the day
leading up to his showdown with Tom asta
and Battle of The Berrics it's pretty
awesome and this is awesome game of
skate so definitely check that out
subscribe a network' if you haven't
already and tell them I sent you that
would rock I'm gonna I'm gonna go though

see eventually take these guys good bye
