from the moment I set foot on a
skateboard everything changed
I mean you don't look at the world the
same steps handrails patches a grass
sidewalks like it's all different
because once your escape or your changed
and it's never gonna go back to being
normal which is good too because growing
up can kind of suck I mean you go
through crazy relationships getting
stabbed in the back by people you
trusted it's just rough sometimes and
one of the only things that was by my
side to get me through all that was my
skateboard you know when it comes to
life like what am I gonna do with my
life I think the better question is how
I'm gonna live and one thing's for sure
I'm going to skateboard until the day I
die
ah man go
how are we going to this video if I get
hurt how am I going to do this video I
guess other people can just watch the
video when it comes out
just watch it even if I get hurt watch
it going to your face man
cheese dude I'm the easiest person to
skip
you
you
