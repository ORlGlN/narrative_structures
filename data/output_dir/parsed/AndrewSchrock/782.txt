alright so that was some footage from
Doug DISA tells and obviously was good
skateboarding you saw it through his
eyes actually but the other angle he
uses it's kind of like what the
skateboard sees although that was really
cool I hope you guys doug its Doug does

he also does a lot of videos on this
channel so if you like what you saw

videos but mainly check out Doug goes
home to eat a corn dog or some mashed
potatoes on one of his videos I don't

meantime goodbye
