YouTube what is up guys it is time for
ultimate paper toss trick shots - second
one we're do the second one that went in
right so a lot of these most of these
are probably be using our skateboards
because we're skateboarders we like to
have fun with it where we have rhyme
bracken here yeah yeah that guy he's
back again I'm gonna have some fun
all right I won't he's on fire the first
thing I want to do is try that three
flip one that you did last time so sorry
to redo one but I've never done it and
now we feel good about myself
are you ready for this yeah the rock no
I'm landing it don't do that so I
literally just put it on my board and
free flip I'm gonna try it my way I like
how he gave me advice and I just ignored
it like I have to try it even though
I've never done it you
oh I didn't land the three flip gosh
do it again yeah by far the hardest I've
ever slammed on a flat ground grief
you
it was a sloppy beautiful bump taken
good I ate way too much on that to not
just take that one I got now it's his
turn which is a great time for me
Brackins do a kickflip manual here have
a camera miggy's got this
Wow that was a solid couple man you just
sucked at the paper paper paper paper
not to make fun of racket or anything
but how easy this is like it's just here
there
though so I was generally starting I
think if Stannis just a good word there
that was good my turn right
nollie lip bigger Hey
now here's the question should I
backboard it or does that not count
you backboard it you didn't
Oh
duck what's the next one
rocky I know - I'm gonna do it HIPPA
trick half-cab frontside flip hip cars
hey hey hey your bottle flipper don't
don't tip it over

preachers armor breaker
I threw that one in I just go hate it
too I guess

one's gonna be a momentous one I don't
think momentous is a word yeah I made
some
Timur swamp

moment to appreciate that I said

do it almost almost empty first try he
didn't land it you thought he did I saw
I do
did you see it so you guys can see is
that I stole my boredom a to go and if
your hand was right here because I put
it in there
so that you could see it when the ball
goes down in there hey Brittany what did
I say well okay so what is it
paper ball but you don't specify paper

simple thing concept
