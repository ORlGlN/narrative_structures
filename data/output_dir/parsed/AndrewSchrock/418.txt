YouTube what is up guys I'm doing a flat
ground tricks video I don't know if I've
ever done one of these and if I have I
don't remember so we're gonna do it
right now I'm gonna give myself 30
minutes I'm not warmed up I'm gonna
start from scratch
I'm gonna see how many flat ground
tricks they can do Eric's gonna film us
and to film me Wow I have issues but
first we're gonna ask Brian Ames how
many tricks he thinks I'm gonna do my
things how many things tricks I'm I do
tricks I just did this Friday on the
phone
he's over here gosh I bet she's in there
I'm gonna say 22 will use Katie
oh well that's Casey - I have 30 minutes
to do as many flip tricks as I can like
Jeopardy's yeah we think I'm gonna do 27
okay
27 let's see what Brennan Casey
I have 30 minutes to do as many filters
as I can do how many thing happen to 100
you can't give me an honest answer
really 30 minutes 30 yeah 30 do you
think I'm gonna do 30 that's what I said
so apparently my friends think higher up
me than I do because we got 30 and 27
and a hundred but that doesn't count I
think pointy - oh yeah thirty - okay all
right can I get your phone
naturally oh he's gone
to
I can't get my work new shoe backside
lifts are the worst you're gonna see the
real struggle how much I suck sometimes
a foot race or I'm gonna do a great
you got a brake shoes in the back side
foot
my front foot every time just slams the
girl
all these are so bad 2620
you just told me kick flip varial flip
three flip backside flip he'll loop give
us up to five and four
thank you
I said this before I'll say many more
times because I talk too much best way
to get exercise just to flat ground
that was 20 minutes left and I'm
struggling on one of my best flat ground
tricks how does that escape work in a
nutshell
just keep going
nerve hook three flip back set foot heel
flip frontside flip fakie flip they'il
half cap flips for ten ten in ten
minutes we're doing good
I'm so happy to this first job
what times 16 minutes we have we have 60
minutes yeah he's got a lot longer than
I thought though I said that Lister's
time on my side
I'll take it
what times
oh just says you got nine minutes take
Ariel
take each other
everything is way harder where you been
skating for 20 straight minutes outside
yeah I have no idea what I'm at like it
might be like 18 might be 17 but I'm
gonna try this my sex changes to boost
my numbers because I've got no time
ticking section
can't believe my later their first truck
thank you for sex change put it
how am i tracking my brain now switch
sex change
what are you doing oh yeah all right
well let's keep going no Lisa
oh yeah
13 seconds
thank you flip fakie heelflip half cap
heel 1/2 cup front heel and switch
varial flip so I think I think I did
exactly 22 and if we didn't we're gonna
have to edit this and count them in here
we got a roof film of talking I'm really
disappointed and that's okay to be
disappointed but I am because when I
started riding them off I was like dude
this is flying by
then I got stuck on like the easiest
tricks in the world and then landed the
harder tricks just like another way and
it way easier if you do
big big spins and like full calves and
180s and stuff and I'm good flip tricks
so that's the challenge
if you whoever you guys want to see do
this on my channel next write down the
info of the comments and I'll see some
of the guys here I can do it that's it
thank you guys for watching Casey's gone
we can't even talk to him
Brian's here yeah I want to talk to
Brian cuz he gave me a sarcastic answer
he's it a hundred he didn't even do a
quarter of it he's an idiot
I mean yeah he did no one can do it if I
want to see someone do 100 different
flip tricks in 30 minutes there's so
many more tricks I could do - that's it
I'm just really thank you guys for
watching I do videos here every single
day so hit the subscribe button you want
to see more and then bail bail me if
that's a thing it's so dumb to say and

argument--fall Friday but the very first
time Casey was going to skate this he's
like I'm gonna backside 5050 this and he
did it if I did it means he didn't do it
