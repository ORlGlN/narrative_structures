trickery died
hey go grab my first day misty continent
I'm gonna push that Wow through my
shoulder out lining it up and then I
realized I was like if I punch me was
gonna hurt but I didn't hurt my shoulder
that's not good what's up guys this
week's featured video is of Nico a Jonin
he's from Finland he does ten tricks in
LA and he can shred on a skateboard it's
actually kind of hard to tell if he's
regular or goofy footed but check this
video out he actually skates Hollywood
High in it and as a skateboarder when
you see a video on youtube that has
Hollywood High footage in it you just
click it you don't even think subscribe
to network a and make sure you tell them
I sent you that will help me out take
these guys
