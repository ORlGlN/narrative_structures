warm up by doing five flip tricks off

what you're gonna do is you're gonna get
you're gonna throw down at the top of
the stairs yes and then and right before
you like kinda room free pop oh wait

we'll start with that okay is that
that's not so bad
okay 10 tricks 10 minute depending on
the tres yes well the thing is is that
well Brian you can get to tell map now
after you throw down Andy's gonna let
you know what the trick is like as
you're rolling up so you're gonna tell
me the position have to throw down in

creepy okay I got super creepy uh
hey who's gonna clean this up oh not me
we should um we should sell this a
baby's again you'll do it you know
you're willing I wasn't even gonna go
there because I feel like i joked about
that you often hold it that's a lot of
stuff yeah that was the best it was a
kind of like a sequel sequel yeah
outro or a sequel door kick after
watching that montage from last week
what Casey's cleaning up how are your
nerves right now how do you feel about
what's happening I'm actually really
excited I'm not nervous what are you
writing
what are you like it's soaking wet
outside you know I don't know it's like
your mind pushing like I'm gonna do
great
this is how I skate okay um five cool
tricks off the ramp five tricks off the

you failed no one will ever know and
they'll be so mad at you exactly but if
you succeed people will know and then
