hi frickin warehouse Wednesday today
sabres is running away he's running the
wrong ways must be over that way oh my
god I got the blue tape on my foot
speared it's like hard to tell it's a
festive time Brian you got to have a
festive things yeah
who's down here we have a special
episode for you guys it is cold we're
lit up we have a guy that's used to
being in warm right here Jason I'm gonna
hug Jason I like Jason a lot now let me
see your face Jason Marquis we're gonna
miss your face you're off to such a
great start because you don't even know
what the challenge is today I think it's
maybe similar all we did last time with
him it is similar but there's a twist
you got to claim your throne so your
goal has become the weirdest
skateboarder alive so here five minutes
okay pause for a second what does Sabre
doing serious must be with us he's just
sitting in the Mustang is that kind of
weird that he likes Mustangs so weird no
judging but I'm just saying so so we're
gonna give you five different items you
go to five minutes you're gonna use
those four items in the most Jason Park
grade we possibly can after five minutes
I'm gonna decide I'm going to decide if
you've deemed yourself weird enough
nothing is correct you saying you're
gonna walk up I will tell you how to
warm up in there then we have a mystery
challenge which I don't know what that
is I'll come up with that on the spot in
there and now you have ten minutes I'll
use four five you have five there's five
items he's in five minutes I'm not gonna
make him do a meta item a minute make it
he's got he's got there's five random
items we're gonna give him he's gonna do
a trick on each and at the end of that
he Bry names has to be able to say that
you are genuinely the weirdest
skateboarder alive okay i-i've all
around weird though okay okay weirdest
it doesn't have to be the weirdest
tricks you just have either weird escape
with her life okay is this Scott is the
world crumbling thank goodness and I
genuinely think he could need to make
this happen you absolutely have it I
have if I would put my faith on your
money if I could I will do the best that
I can but if you do to that you get
thirty bucks
hey you said dude and if not and if not
you have to just fill them up five
tricks on a rip stick okay yeah yeah I
don't even know which one you want to do
more this is gonna be fun dude I like
this I like you I like Brian I love her
still just sitting in a Mustang yeah you
were supposed to be the wingman
protect my friend Sam
oh you've got zippers on your bag you
guys how do we want you to warm up I
know there's so many options of J
support whoa okay no I got the idea you
go over the stairs with that he's gonna
hold that you have to ollie
under that but down the stairs under it
but yeah okay
limbo where'd you even get that is it
yours Brian no you got a ollie down
beneath it yeah you get Hurley grab oh
it's a warm-up it's a warm-up that was a
breezy
he's sorry it looked cool I
liked it
alright two more warm-up tricks since I
know that you're a talent this ramp
inside Brian's stomach you're going to
gap out to nose manual to nose manual to
nose mail in the box over there and then
just land okay yeah you got it get warm
hi
yeah oh yeah
see you didn't get one did you out uh
see that's not a warm-up trick I was
gonna say blunt kickflip I can try it
yeah that's what you think you did that
easy oh he's got that it these are the
first try
get out of here
when I have grandchildren they're gonna
be smiling cuz that trick I'm gonna be
smiling when you have grandchildren okay
yeah I'm gonna name a few
good this is just going the misery
challenge is that you have to take that
orange cone over there and do whatever
you want with you don't have to use it
but you just have to take it with you
and you got to make Casey say what are
you doing three times okay okay okay
however you whatever it takes to get
that without actually saying say what
are you doing okay all right okay this
is gonna be amazing
yeah it's gonna be so baseball it
doesn't even involve skateboarding no
mystery challenge is free Rain Man we
had we had Casey say don't stop hey I
remember that three times three times
okay I feel like I feel like twice would
be too easy yeah let's go for three
even really like what are you doing you
see the world with the hardest thing I
know just the warm-up I said it's not a
journeys all this time ok ok we'll call
it one word in it cross your mind out of
what he was doing I thought this is the
warm-up is by it if you sort of like
slapping him really hard
what are you doing oh yeah yeah you
should have used him either way that was
good feels get out my house the basic
that was amazing thank you I fail no
yeah but is the mystery challenge it you
don't have to you don't have pass that
cool if as long as you give it like it's
like a truth or dare you just got to
give it your effort Brian let's pick the
obstacles say I did not get a little
film did you your head oh man
ever since that Jason oh to be weird you
have do tricks using this this this this
and this this this is this the weirdest
skateboarder alive I mean let that in I
could just drain into your body and be
you that's the first one I guess 10
minutes and come commence
I don't know if this is going to hurt
what dude don't get hurt what is
happening
Wow why did that happen
well that took a long time first of all
