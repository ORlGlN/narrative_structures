you too but what is up guys today we are
doing a tire tube game of skate this is
a bike tire
I caught it facing the camera - is that
good so what we're going to do with this
is we are going to put this on our
skateboard so it kind of creates
bindings like a snowboard we tried it
years ago and we kind of sucked at it
yeah so we can do the whole park it's
not just a flat ground or a box or a
rail but we're gonna get these out put
them on skateboards and see if we suck
this is cool if you like it this is he
sites you just go to like any store that
sells bikes and you do one of these
butterfly in my face I can go to figure
out how we did it you remember this I
don't recall it being like we're gonna
make this happen one right well you can
just wrap it on the truck so many times
you want so this will be easy to make
happen song stuck in my head
it is absolutely how it goes I really
hope this doesn't come off and hit me in
the face now what are you doing Alex
yeah
somebody help me up you're not using the
come on we can do this yes this is the
most di this is way more dangerous not
those I'm gonna bring back don't we have
another video to film after this this
must be the crap out of Hannity you did
where is he going
that's pretty good
gonna go right here
I'm gonna keep going because I can't
stop we literally just turn them into
snake
50/50 right here
dang it
failures over here that guy they got it
though and easy
50/50 back 180
that guy's got this
you stop
that was hard unbelievably president
we got to be creative and we're gonna
kill each other I would be very bad at
this
he's got to redo it not good enough
I just knew it was Brian's and he
wouldn't care was it a nollie backside
360 briefs back back backside 360 he did
it that was super good
I might have actually yeah there's a big
thing underneath it
that's so terrifying over over Rhino
back 180 out you got to really get your
foot on them this is hard
it sucks that you can't stop
as weird fells I'm standing here I'm
gonna front
that would be so Gary died
he's just over there pointing his finger
at me I'm a king that was gnarly
like jump into this chat
shocked think everything in life I'm
shocked to do not do gosh that would
suck wow that was super clean
I really hope
sorry are you alright
I literally just walked right in front
of the camera
the trick is to not actually put your
weight on it and just kind of press down
and then pull up before you fall he's
doing it
it shouldn't was your heart
do together
I put my wrist down one time okay hey
that guy is at an A and I have no idea
what to do
alright hey let's do a stall in there
there dude how am I gonna get up here
it's hard to get to the top of this
I don't know if it seems longer legs or
his here town but he's better at moving
like going faster this I'm just trying
to go I'm trying to get somewhere that
wasn't in
yeah I think you got to redo that I feel
like we could just check the footage and
see if I was writing out the reusing
footage
100% private
we should give him a review on thumbs-up
defense it's okay it was sloppy
defensively don't care
on your tail
word to the wise don't try to tell side
rubber
I was so difficult
I've never done a front sign here in my
life
I'm getting out of here watch out
definitely got to redo that
fantastic
it's a try
take me a second to even get
and touch don't care
how's good yeah that really
shouldn't have counted zero video what
why are you so low
it was like it wasn't a hand touch it
was like that's why I rolled away is
because I had touch it's okay it's okay
dude touch exists
I can't do it that was very difficult
that's good because I didn't die I will
take a letter any day other than die on
that
that was insane
else yeah that was it I don't think was
feebly
now I misty Steve
maybe that would be so hard
how do you get there
oh you roll up and go to fakie
the feds he has do a front so an ad
immediately before makes it in so it
hurt
we are
perfect
that is unworldly
no no you do do a half cab and then will
come out I can't do that that's it how
was good how's a good finisher
unbelievable
it doesn't suck actually I'm happy that
was terrifying I was dangerous that was
difficult and that was sometimes easy
fun to watch but that was a lot of fun
at the same time yeah so have you guys
do this it's like 10 bucks for one of
these tubes be careful but it's a lot of
fun
