there was that was pounding friends the
third installment of the footage that
he's recently sent me and I just want to
point out that was great skating and all
you guys clearly knew that it was
enjoyable it wasn't entertaining it was
awesome but those were some of the best
skate spots amber-like that long
halfpipe mini ramp thing in the woods I
would skate that I would suck at it but
I would skate it so if you ever in
Sweden ask Palin where to skate because
it's amazing but yeah that's it go check
out his channel he has amazing footage
good friends and he's a good dude bottom
link right there click that if you want
to see more from me I'll be the top lane
but mainly check out Palin and that is
it goodbye
