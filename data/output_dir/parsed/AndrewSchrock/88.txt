YouTube what is up guys we are about to
do the hardest trick shot video we were
filming so the story is is that I was in
target somebody came up to me said they
liked my videos I love your trick shots
in the warehouse you should do a soccer
one that was like that's impossible
other than just kicking the soccer ball
around I think we've incorporated
skateboarding you'd be really hard but
it could could be fun so that's what
we're doing today we got this mini
soccer ball we got Brian Eames chasing
without beating space and we have my
face it yours you're watching this so
yours is included in this goal is to do
two each okay I'm gonna start out with
the three flip the classic put up the
ball on the board three flip into the
goal good luck this is the hardest one
for do you think so no way I got it it
is noon what's your guess 1240 used to
be 40 minutes wow that's high
I gotta go that way but Brian I didn't
land the three flip you the land the
three go to 12:42 I didn't land the
three flip but Brian Eames do I go to a
chalkboard and write I do not know
anything you didn't land the three plus
100 times where these guys have a salt
forty minutes might be accurate I'm as
good at this as I am real soccer
so bad
that was fast and exciting I'm going
straight off this is seven minutes
I felt so many more than seven minutes
worth I thought this is gonna be a very
hard to make video and we are like 35
minutes better than Brian Eames brain so
he's up next zoom the old 50/50
footballs kick that's really early
I thought it was gonna take you 42
minutes how do you think first rap Wow
he cheaped out all right Alex mama
he's just set the ball over there he's
gonna tail slide and bash you into the
ball and make it go right
I still missed it
like with a basket you see it go in
you're like yes with a soccer you're
like how cool I did it it's just it's
just kind of in a box now I'm gonna do
the old boardslide watch I'll show you
oh all right my thoughts are this or
like this like see maybe maybe see if I
just hit the ball we'll come up with
another option we've been getting some
wax we'd be having some wax
I'll get it we'll make it happen
I almost keep going into it I'm gonna go
crying because the boardslide is not
working
you want it going in now you wouldn't do
don't know why but you put a soccer ball
on a rail and it makes a basic trick
very hard did I just mess it up myself
don't think about the ball after my
career
yes III go get him Brian was that better
I still didn't judge completely during
the trick dropping head it's gonna be it
could be the finale that's good
I think he's gonna do this way easier
than I thought
that was so good dude Supermarket you
should do a skateboard trick shot hockey
I will I will that is definitely I will
play played hockey for 13 years so Alex
I know is skating this and you just set
the goal all the way over there
it just looks like a piece of trash
because it's by the all the other random
crap we have like it's 12:42 we've been
very good about filming this video so
somebody's got a screw decide well go
ahead
not thank you you were gonna do it that
common collected right because when your
chicken was like like not free feed like
never just a normal kick he did it I
think I think I like your banging on the
best though that word out way better
than I thought it was going to be I hope
you guys enjoyed it I think we're gonna
do hockey next right so do the hockey
skateboarding trick shots for sure yeah
that makes me feel special we'll use the
toy hockey if you want a body I hope you
