you too what is up skateboarding guys
guys let's try that again
you too what is up guys there you go hit
down it is can we shred it episode 2 the
premise was to go to Goodwill and find
something random but this episode the
thing is coming to us ok do you know
what it is
how do you know it is we even went out
there together yet it's already here I
told you it alone yeah because we talked
about it I'm inside of this episode
because I think this item is not going
to last that long so we're going to get
creative while not destroying it I want
skated would you agree I've seen it you
if there was a scantron right now would
you agree yeah ok
these dudes boobah are all here to help
them you know Alec okay see but you know
most of other dudes too but specifically
the demented guys ok are nice enough to
bring this to us so I'm not gonna tell
you it is we're gonna go out and get it
we're gonna bring it inside the
warehouse we're gonna skateboard on it
yeah probably
it is probably the thumbnail and the
title and everyone already knows oh hey
we're suddenly outside aren't we we are
yeah what do we got here it's a big TV
this is going to be fun dude yeah
look at that it's like a boxes - oh my
yeah it's really short how oh wow let's
not get cut on the screen tailslide but
why can't that be a no slide Brian what
he got to do that because it's my tail
over you just get the truck all right
off the truck no I was kidding I'm
kidding
that'll be an entirely different episode
I got hide this is like the perfect but
TV to skate well I wish we have medium
sized RAM because we have a tiny ramp
with a big ramp I'll make it happen
though
oh I was just seeing if it would like
let me go stop it okay
oh we should try it is that a bad idea
Brian get the back I try to hold on to
this and they don't not do that yeah
it's a great idea but it's not I know
it's one of those things I get on a dog
like ever I shouldn't do I was just
hoping somebody else told me it was okay
to do it but so I could just do it like
conscience room I'm going to cut up work
you know put the TV on the cutoff board
you to wield over there that's a
horrible idea
they want you to set it on there
sit down there this is amazing right all
right
No do not write it so just set it down
we're fine
this is one good cutaway skateboard now
that we set the tv down we're moving
into the other side of the warehouse
- here's an idea
yeah I don't think that's that crazy we
need a gap though it's going to be short
but I think it'll be good and I'm an
idiot right before I started filming I
was like I'll have a skateboard for this
day for together great timing huh can we
get like an actual channel anything they
do right and plugged it in all right in
the meantime I'm going to ask you guys
