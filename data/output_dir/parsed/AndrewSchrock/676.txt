YouTube it's skate time and I'm playing
it I last I told you that I was playing
with Brian Eames okay it's cruiser skate
okay we're gonna tricks on that and see
if the other guy can land it hopefully
it's not like four so you guys are there
hurry with that let's skate with lane
Brian Eames nine brick two goes first
two or three on four okay get wrestlers
shoes okay ah great are you ready I'm
ready
okay so this is what a cruiser looks
like it is way skinnier a little bit
longer I guess I don't know it's just
it's kind of like a toothpick it's not
skating a to thing right look look at my
feet they kind of dominated I think he
flips are disrespectful I know you can
keep for the 9k but we're done I'm
probably gonna do it's like doing 180s
and you escape no one is once you're
past a certain point you don't need to
do anything
you buddy is gonna kick definitely gonna
he's gonna do 360 Club
the mamas kickflip I've ever done in my
life though this gets away this was
better than mine
I'm gonna check this out a mid trick
see where do you really wanted that K on
them did you did you fake Tigers
yes the temperature is rising in the
room for Andy you move you move you did
you forget that Peggy Biggs one of the
dumb tricks be missing a game skate that
well you trying to go over like oh my
god let's look at the last two faggy
flips that he's done and see the
difference
at an art show yeah it was good well I
wouldn't you in gradually
vocab flip was a animal that was a story
that's an actual metaphor no that was
like a giraffe that doesn't have much
long
oh my gosh YouTube wants you to play by
the rules and do to each other but since
everybody would comment along thank you
guys for watching that was really good
skater please please for me
see you later something to do that but
we'll do we'll keep having more games of
skaters and just so we don't forget the
winner is

freaky
