Jason Hanson this is your room
give us a story your room but I see a
huge tech deck poster that's pretty cool
I was like good story for that too good
job there isn't there's muggle crazy dog
crazy dog crazy buddy all right dude
this Mario is the best thing ever
yeah that's probably the coolest thing
in the room to be honest with you you
want all these trophies yeah
amongst other things right and
basketball dude you're just you trying
to be modest here man there's where's
your Justin Bieber poster huh you know
you don't have one of those no you got a
freakin play round of darts let's see it
and yet the third vote not even go oh
dude it's like a magnet yeah yeah that
sucks no more well that wouldn't was
just horrible what were you trying to
add some style to it you have like three
feet away all right what'd you say we go
do what you're best at in the skateboard
all right oh dude hit it
you tubers what is up
so that was JC's bio video if you like
the idea when I got going here and you
want to see the other guys on the team
spotlighted give this a thumbs up and I
will get to work on it but a little bit
about Jase he should probably be here
telling you about himself but I didn't
film it so you got me I've known Jay
since he was five years old he's 13 now
like so I've known him for the greater
portion of his life his whole family is
kind of like a second family to me so
he's like my little brother
when I was getting her revenge together
he actually asked to come to the skate
park with us and like he didn't really
even know how to like kinda Ollie and
roll around but he didn't know how to
skate and he started progressing really
fast and I was like I thought it'd be
cool to have a you know younger guy on
the team that you could see his
progression for the whole like
throughout all of the videos so what
I'll do is actually I'll find the first
video that he was in and I will put a
link at the end of this video but um
he's an awesome kid you know he's he's
got he's a ball of energy he's always
down to skate and he doesn't you know he
just like has honest fun out there on
the skateboard so it's really really
cool to see him like just grow like as a
skateboarder and whatnot um but he's
pretty cool pretty cool little guy and
if you see him be sure to give a paddle
back and tell me he's doing good because
we are all proud of him
but I'm gonna stop talking it's like
four it's four nineteen in the morning
and I'm still up making a video but rock
on so I'm sorry about the lack of energy
I have here but I should be in bed
sleeping I'm not so so I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna say subscribe or die there's
some extra footage at the end of this
and the link good bye
