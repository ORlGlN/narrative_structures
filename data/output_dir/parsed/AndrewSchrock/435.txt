skateboarding is lost it's less
seriously what happened to it it used to
be so different growing up we used to
just watch skate videos and go out and
have fun that's it we didn't care about
the biggest handrail or the biggest gap
or even if a trick was good enough like
we just skated and had a blast and I
want to get back to that like I want to
bring the fun back into skateboarding
dude Andy I don't care just do your
trick just even good enough I'm not
doing this dude you got full padded
protection on the point this is like an
Arctic breast saver dude you got it you
