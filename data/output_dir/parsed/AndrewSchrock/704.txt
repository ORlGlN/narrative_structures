hey what's up other guy here it's me hi
nice to meet you we're here in
Switzerland and snowing outside but we
gotta go snow skate so that's actually
not a bad thing and we got to go to my
local park and try to do some tricks my
garden is fully covered in snow oh oh we
get a blue shovel and that's my car and
we gonna get rid of this snow
I can get it this is how it looks inside
of this beautiful car and we gotta go to
my local park now
so we are at my local park now we got a
blue shovel
we got a snow skirt
we got a railer revised deck that I was
skating for about one month and we got
some fancy gloves
dang so my friend Martin is about to get
warmed up a flat bar nice try that was
pretty close so the hardest part is
always to run up whatever you want to
skate the hardest part of it is always
to run up because it's like really hard
to keep balance on these snow skates but
because it's going for the bar side
right now oh that was so good
that was so good preparing this but
right now
see that
I am so scared right now
this is really sketchy
we're gonna switch sides
maybe it's gonna be better this side
because the snow is still fresh
all right so you see the snow was fresh
and to run it was technically seen okay
that was it
believe it or not I didn't know press on
the thing yesterday
because there's no wasn't a bad day
yesterday yesterday all right let's go
yeah I guess it was the last clip of
today so gonna go home now there you
guys go that was a sort of a mini day in
the life with Johnny Geiger apparently
it snows wait too often in Switzerland
during the winter and you know when you
can't skate you got a snow skate so I
hope you guys dug that if you want to
