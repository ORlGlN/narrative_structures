alright so that was Jordan hunter and I
could talk this dude up for so long but
I'm gonna try to keep it short he's part
of the force team and he is a one-man
demo these were casual clips he filmed
on a cell phone for the most part if you
ever get to see him in real life he will
literally put on a show for you without
even trying plus he just started a
YouTube channel and he's been uploading
content on a regular basis so you need
to check it out the bottom link right
there will take you to it and of course
I do daily videos here myself so click
the top lane for me but mainly check out
Jordan he's an awesome dude and I love
what he does on the skateboard so check
him out that's it I'm gonna go hey cat
oh wait you can't talk
