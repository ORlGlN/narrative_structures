all right that was Drake Johnson guys he
was down in Florida recently throwing
down all of these tricks as a pretty
awesome watch is a cool bag of tricks
and he is very talented on that
skateboard it's actually from my buddies
Mason Miller's youtube channel and he
posts content pretty consistently for a
while now so if you like what you saw
definitely check him out as the bottom
link right down there and if you want to
see more from me I do daily videos here
so click the top leg for me but mainly
check out Mason and that's it I am going
to go clean my warehouse now it's going
to suck so make sure you're doing
something better than cleaning and if
you have to clean I'm sorry I feel your
pain goodbye
