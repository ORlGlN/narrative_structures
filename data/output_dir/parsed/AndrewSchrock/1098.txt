what's up guys this is a day in life 30
my 30th one it's been it's been a time
this is a little different this extra
weekend day I thought I would do it not
on a workday so it's not the same exact
thing as I always do and yes I totally
need to take my Christmas decorations
down but by the time this video goes up
they will be gone so at least there's
that right first thing I'm doing is I'm
meeting a sabered shred quarters today
to film the rest of a skit that I need
to put up and then I'm gonna meet up
with some dudes and go skateboard so
that's the plan I'm gonna go kiss my
wife goodbye because I'm leaving that's
what you do when your husband hello
yeah run away goodbye bye hello I love
you let me did you know that thank you
cuz I tell you all the time hey we
should move to Turkey he drops or
freakin go down come on
ridin actually stay the night at his
grandma's house because uh the wife and
I had a date night last night so that
was awesome but that's why you're not
seeing him in the beginning the video I
will meet up with him and after
skateboarding and be with him for the
rest the day which will be awesome but
right now coffee and then meeting saber
at red course let's do this
thank you
Oh weird sound effect for lights turning
on but hey that's what happened alright
so I'm here and a saber is late because
he always is I really should have told
him to be here at 10:30 rather than
11:00 guess if I would have told him
10:30 he would have been here at 11:00
that have been amazing and that's what I
want to hear so I'm just gonna clean up
because I left this place pretty messy
when I left here on Friday so that's I'm
gonna do right now
