YouTube what's up guys so this video is
actually for you guys this is for my
wife it's our anniversary today and I
want to make a video just telling her
that I love her and I want to put on
YouTube because I want the whole world
to know that's I love this girl so much
and this is a song I played at my
wedding she has not heard it since then
and I did mess up a little bit but I was
nervous you know I was playing for the
most beautiful girl in the whole world
so I know what everyone probably thinks
that I would ride a slow and sweet song
for my wife at the wedding but it is a
wedding I wanted to be exciting for
everybody so I kind of wrote it more
upbeat and catchy and the words are
still sweet though and for all you
youtubers there's a skate video coming
out later today but there you go babe I
have to do this once in a while I have
to sit on top of a mountain and shout to
the world that I love you and I guess
the Internet is my mountain today but
seriously I love you so much and I meant
every single word I wrote in the song
and I can't wait to spend the rest of my
life with you or continue spending the
rest of my life with you because we'd be
married but there you go
first time that I saw
but still I had to stand and I knew
right then
Machu Picchu
let's go
cream starter
but
be my
and seven roses later
honey
you my arms you can say both their legs
for you instead and josue walk this life
remember this - not as long as I have
breath forever forever be my bride
the unities
and then you thank you everybody
