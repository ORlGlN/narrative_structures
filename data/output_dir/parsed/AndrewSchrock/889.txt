okay so not really the question is is
there anything Fabien can't do really
well because it's incredible you ever
tried carbon boarding a triple flip is
not easy
I could even double flip it I'm that bad
at it and he can triple flip it and then
he gets on an actual skateboard he's
doing huge half cab he'll crack runs
Fabien is awesome and he's super
talented he's a nice dude and he has a
YouTube channel the bottom link will get
you right to it so click that to check
more of Fabien out I do daily videos
here myself so hit the top link but
mainly check out Fabien have you in go
try to triple clip a cardboard see we
can do it it's really difficult I'm
gonna go ride a roller coaster that's
not true at all I lied to you
and now I can't be trusted good bye
