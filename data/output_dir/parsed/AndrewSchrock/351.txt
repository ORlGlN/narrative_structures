feeding the cream is not going to love
it's not going to last long at all but I
mean go back add some fragments may
exist so I want you to be very clear
that this is a broken iPad I got a deal
on a broken iPad on lines now this in
continuity it would cost less to get
working iPad a pressure because this is
the first generation applications doing
work on this thing anymore
technology is stupid and they make
things they become obsolete and this is
super obsolete there's no point to this
doesn't work so we're going to destroy
it
we're going to toss it around do some
durability test and then we're going to
skateboard on this which we have a
surprise for you guys and if you tell
that's on now let's not surprised at all
we're going to skate it and then we're
going to go to the destruction phase and
turn this thing to duck give me fun
