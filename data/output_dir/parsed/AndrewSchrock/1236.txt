how are you gonna do a one-footed knows
man I mean if I tried that I wouldn't
get very far I definitely wouldn't go up
a bank and back down it that is some
board control right there that was Chris
Parsons and he is completely talented on
a skateboard apparently you can make it
do whatever he wants to do and that was
filmed by James Weber who is a
skateboarder himself and he shreds he
has a youtube channel and that's the
bottom link right down there so they
want to see more from Chris and James
click that and like what you see because
he's really good at producing content on
a regular basis I do daily videos myself
so click the top link for me but mainly
check out James and then that's it I'm
gonna go pet a cat and i'll see you guys
in the future goodbye
