what we find right if you took shapes
and you had a big hand and you pushed it
into the ground like as you turn it yeah
two-thirds of the way and then aged it
by 110 years this is it here's the New
York version of shapes Doug I will give
you 20 bucks if you three flip nose man

you're gonna roll up this okay I will
give you five bucks if you do a manual
careful about within three tries the
roll up wasn't happening for the through
who knows man I give him that I will
give him that
Oh one try that was 102 it's tough isn't
it
this is just a running jump or is it the
fact that we just skated across
Manhattan
