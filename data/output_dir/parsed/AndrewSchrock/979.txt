you
boom guys that was I Andrew Oliveira and
he can trick his skateboard that was
Phil my Mason Miller and you'll never
guess what they were doing today and the
reason you'll never guess it because you
don't know and I don't know either
because I wasn't with them so if you
guys like the amazing skateboarding the
bottom link rides on there is Mason's
channel he films a lot of good
skateboarding content including Andrews
so check it out I myself do daily videos
here on YouTube on the top links to
click that but mainly check out Mason
and then you know if you were those
people that happen to know what they're
doing today you better be their friend
that's weird check out Mason goodbye
