pool because it is hot you won't believe
it
Eliza is actually standing up I'm not
holding her she's standing on her own
and this is awesome
but it doesn't mean she's getting bigger
that kind of sucked mommy mom lies and I
got out you're doing really well in the
pool Liza yes you are it blew my mind
when I put her feet down at the bottom
and realized she could actually stand I
was just like wow cuz last year you know
last year she was way smaller she just
grown up really fast we're out here
enjoying some of the weather I'm trying
to keep the kids busy while Veronica's
doing the horse barn and I was just
looking at the weather and we've got
some really severe storms coming later a
little later so I'm gonna try and charge
up and get a really awesome time-lapse
for that I want to capture this year at
some point oh don't get your foot stuck

solid lightning strike photo and a good
one I don't know why just it's one of
the photos I've always wanted to capture
