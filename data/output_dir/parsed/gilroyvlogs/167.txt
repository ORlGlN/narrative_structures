what's up guys welcome to a brand new
year and to celebrate we're gonna have a
nice fun little challenge video but I'm
gonna need a little bit of help from my
man Dennis Roady what do you got Legos
and a nerf gun we need two more people
water bottle
Caleb and arrow perfect so the goal is
to knock down all of these water bottles
using a loaded nerf gun any bottles left
standing after you're fully out of ammo
equals a walk down the path of Lego gas
I'll bet you're wondering what the Lego
walk of death is well for every one
remaining bottle of water left on the
table after you are out of nerf gun ammo
you will have to walk down a very long
painful path of LEGO pieces completely
barefoot why diplomatic use of paper
rock scissors the aura has been chosen
and Dennis you're up first
