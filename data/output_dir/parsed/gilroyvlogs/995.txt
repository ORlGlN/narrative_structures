whole bag of Doritos the big bag okay
you know a bag you don't understand I
have an affinity for Doritos Doritos are
my favorites really yeah I'm not gonna
like you if you bash my Doritos just so
you know who's thanks I love Doritos oh

used to be pure corn they're a
corn-based thing and now they're made
with genetically modified corn which is
bad for your body so the corporation
Monsanto after with your Doritos making
them now like a cancer-causing agent in
your body where it used to just be pure
joy so I know I'm not bashing Doritos
