of our trip right here this is things
like see if I can make it noop before it

loading up all the stuff and I'm pretty
sure with my strategic planning and
packing skills I figured a way to not

on some of my editing
I got biscuits and gravy coming up
shortly after this vlog so make sure you
keep your eyes out on that I'm pretty
sure I'm going to post it at 3:30 p.m.
so it should be pretty funny you'll also
have to go over and check out James's
biscuits in gravy because between the
American and the English like verbal
iteration of what biscuits and gravy is
it's completely different that's why
they're funny so you might have to watch
both of them just to understand why

great time with the family the boys

anniversary at the beach so it was a lot
of fun all right that's what I got for
