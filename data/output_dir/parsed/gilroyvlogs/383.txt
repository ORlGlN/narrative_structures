hey guys welcome to the vlog starting in
the garage again today I check this out
look at the hatchlings no this is an
actually seedlings their sprouts
we have sprout these are the sunflower
we got a little bit of spinach popping
up here also I have my dad here is doing
some cool stuff he's actually uh showing
off his power wash stuff this was like
dark green just a moment ago look at
that looks like it's just melting away
right there we're making them like a
before and after image thing look this
stuff up here was so green before and
now it's just literally melting away
it's awesome man Mazel you got your
second degree nozzle your third degree
in your straight shooter be his number
one Zod yep got that everything's all
car oh my goodness
always oh exalted bigger squawk
with the fan that's cool and it doesn't
damage plants or anything right that's
why I precept your plants first mmm good
total plants before and after and you're
good to go
nice kind of nice my dad showed up to do
that for us today I'm gonna shoot some
clips for him to use for his business
for promotion to show the difference
between before and after that stuff
literally works it took it was like
minutes if not seconds before what he
sprayed on there started just melting
the green stuff off so a lot of
homeowners are going through that right
now where they're trying to do their
house wash all right we're gonna do this
part of the garage this is the only part
that looks like this it's awful here's
the before look at this you guys look
how good that looks
I wonder if it translates on camera
can't tell but this is spic and span
clean eyes ahh
so I'm gonna try and put together a
little something for him for Facebook
because I mean I did this for free so
well Veronica has gone to the horse barn
so why don't we have a look and see what
she's up to
told you guys I was coming over we're
gonna brush him out try and get some
more of this hair off of him and one Jim
a little bit oh goodness
the feel good Oh scratch scratch scratch
look look at all that hair yep it's
important when the warm weather hits to
help your horse get shut out from all
his winter coat so that way he doesn't
overheat
it's hard to take the little brush to
like their legs and around their joints
and stuff watch this is nobody shedding
it's not focusing oh yeah you can just
pull all the hair off of them now we're
going to go out munch and Indra for a
little bit give them a little workout
involving horses it's not going to
cooperate so much today
he just wants tough lunge so we're going
to get out of wit now you don't actually
use the whip to whip the horse it just
motivates them to move faster
and there we launched him one time it's
important to lunge a horse like before
you ride gets their muscles warmed up
it's them
if they have any extra energy or
anything like that it gets their energy
out they can run on out on the lead line
before you get on them but you want to
make sure that you lunge both ways
so that way you're warming up and
exercising both sides of the muscles on
both sides of their body so we're going
to switch sides and lunge them for a
little while the other way
another key you want to make sure you
cool down your horse before you put them
away you know or you're done so just
walk in am letting them release and get
everything cooled back down is a good
thing he does need a lot of work he's
got a long way to go don't you baby
we're working enjoy back into the rehab
program

for a minute of course some people don't
like thank you
I'll put this in the fridge to chill but
now it's just time to fire the grill
those of you who watch me all the time
you know that I cook with charcoal
because I like the flavor and I just
like the way it cooks I always always
always use charcoal let me give you guys
a quick grill tip you should try and
create zone so if you can split your
grill surface to have a hot zone and a
not so hot zone that's good practice so
that way when you're cooking your food
you have different heat zones you don't
burn everything up real quick it's nice
to have a place for your food to get
away from the heat if it needs to
oh my gosh this is looking so good can't
wait Kenya look at that we got corn on
the cob steaming on the table pop oh you
didn't do baked potatoes huh well I just
boiled them and then I'm gonna dip all
there match them with a fork and put
like chip dip on them you could there's
