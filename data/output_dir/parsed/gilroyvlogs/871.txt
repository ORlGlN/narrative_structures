good morning gladiators I am now on my
way we have a baby checkup today see how
the baby's doing all that good stuff I'm
excited I always like to hear you know
the baby's heartbeat and I can feel her
and they're moving around but it's
always nice to actually hear her
heartbeat 101 46 that's thought what's
going on
so far everything looks good baby's
heart rates 146 I'm just good it's right
round one it's been running my blood
pressure's 108 over 56 I think she said
which is good
concerning me last time it was a little
low as only 98 over 56 so came back up a
little it's right around where I run low
blood pressure so now I'm just waiting
on the doctor to come in what's up blood
hard for you I'm not sure oh oh that's a
long way back just like now I'm handing
out I was actually really only in their
half hour maybe if that come back every
two weeks now until probably I think
it's the last month or month and a half
and then I have to come weekly so they
can just check up maybe make sure that
the baby's growing okay and
things going alright um so when I come
back in two weeks you guys will be
excited I get another ultrasound and I
have to do this
diabetes testing or they check for just
a tional diabetes because pregnant women
can develop diabetes just while they're
pregnant and it goes away afterwards so
I have to drink this real sugary liquid
and wait an hour and then they test my
blood to see you know how my body reacts
to the sugar get excited I'm on the
