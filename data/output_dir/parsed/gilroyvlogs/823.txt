sent them to church this morning
what's grandma and I didn't vlog at the
birthday party just because you know

weird being around people who are new
first of all and then you're invited to
their home for birthday party
it's just impolite to be hey welcome to
YouTube you know would you believe that
the theme of the birthday party was
frozen so I just so having to get the
right card that's awesome

and I don't know this is the home
stretch of enjoying the last few days of
us being a family of four

the progress of the the hospital still
has their flu rules so unfortunately the
kids aren't going to be allowed to come

good or does it hurt

good actor you need to just sit and
relax safe against that the last thing
