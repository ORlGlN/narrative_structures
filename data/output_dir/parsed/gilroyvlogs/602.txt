pumped girls was the meet up here like
subway or something poor Eliza she's
like done done done she's she wants to
get out of this car I can't blame her
either because like imagine being a
little baby you don't know anything
you're just stuck strapped into this
harness and the seat hand and poop in
your pants I'm gonna poop in your pants
yeah sure bro hungry gosh woman crisis
averted
Eliza has appeared it's all better now
we had to stop in the subway got power
for the laptop to upload the vlog and
look at look at how many of them how
many people are in our crew
the old people don't belong the rest of
them are with us I feel bad I got these
people back here they're getting an
overworked right we got split up okay
hurry up okay they're going to super
Wings get boogie boards and don't get
for the love of Christ and everything
holy don't get any more hermit crabs

they go in there want to get hermit
crabs so I am going to take my laptop
and go over to that coffee shop right
over here that's the same coffee shop
that I go to every time I'm here and try
to upload videos it usually happens
within like 15 minutes so try and hop
over there get the vlog up meet that
back up with them and then we be out of
the beach boy other one on the books
we're back again at my favorite favorite
coffee spot to upload my Wi-Fi home here
at the Outer Banks its Outer Banks
coffee this place is so cool so homey
and I was just talking with the owner
about how he does his beans he wrote his
own beans here same no Starbucks with a
no Tim Hortons he does all his own beans
look at all those different flavors
this custom roaster manual not automatic
not computer generator it's all manners
this kind of stuff is good got to vlog
up I even spoke with the guy who owns
that coffee shop about maybe doing a
little piece for the vlog where he shows
us how to roast his coffees and stuff I
think that'd be really cool thumbs up
you want to see that everyone's riding
bikes and taking selfies and having fun
in the Sun so we're gonna rejoin the
family and see what kind of fun we can
get into today
here you're messed up I'm not I'll take
their show me it let's do it
we're dad's telling me he saw the same
kite I got 417 bucks which mine wasn't
$17 a little more expensive well well he
wasn't wrong
I mean look this is a 62 inch sport two
line airfoil kite it is the same kite
and half off of 34 bucks would be 17
it's just made a different material
it doesn't have as many support lines
and it's just not it's just not it's
just not same I'm pretty sure it's I've
kind of seen that crash yeah it's
identical so we're getting some
essential items everybody have covered a
beach house and this place is a monster
look behind you there's so many people
here what's funny is like everyone has a
list and they're all doing the same
thing going I'll get this you get that
circle house is ready they're heading
back
oh so it's time to go to our beach house
let's well I can't wait
mmm what are you doing the tire thing
already
where do you think of these awesome yeah
these are Vaughn zippers the Von Zipper
they didn't have any
I missed it Oh watch Veronica come
unglued come just open the door and
wrapped her in the head you just busted
me in the head with the door
look at those flag lasses yeah you look
like that cop from from Super Troopers
I'm just kidding
so Veronica's letting the air out of the
tire is if if you are new to the vlogs
you haven't seen us go to the Outer
Banks before when you drive on the beach
you have to let a bit of your air out so
that your tires are flat and give it
more surface area instead of digging in
just rides better you don't you don't
want me to drive see all these people
waited noobs ha-ru sided this is
probably your most anticipated part
right here here we go
this is what we live for when we come to
the Outer Banks our favorite part put
