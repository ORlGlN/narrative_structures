have you guys ever had MREs now yeah
dunno MRE stands for ya know meals ready
to eat that's the video we're doing
today oh uh yeah we should probably get
to it Oh what up guys welcome to today's
video something a little different
something hopefully a little delicious
we're going to be trying out MREs and
this is the only kind of MREs that I
could find locally let us know in the
comments do you want to see us do an
actual like traditional military style
MRE I used to have those when I was
younger and they're they're quite
different so I've never had these before
I don't know what to expect so we've got
three different flavors we've got sweet
and sour pork lasagna with meat sauce we
got scrambled eggs with bacon yes and
for dessert we've got that cheesecake
apparently all this is freeze-dried it's
like crunchy there's like been freed red
and now it's country yeah okay just as
if it were breakfast we're going to
start with scrambled eggs with bacon so
I guess we gotta open it first and I'm
okay so it says that we need to add 1
cup of boiling water do you want to try
this as it's dry you and red don't don't
soon cause good
that's a cup let's come Webster oh it
smells like breakfast good baking mix
with like yee-haa egg while that is
soaking or whatever has to do there we
will go ahead and start with the other
stuff we could get it all like Sofia
this one is sweet and sour pork
you should totally try every every bite
we select with right what is all right
so you teleport freeze-dried actually
uses one flavor pop one go okay
tartanbeat these I shouldn't try to make
it what people tell me what
comes to me that's done that's usually
did and for our last entr√©e lasagna
with meat sauce it's all pretty much the
same it's freeze-dried you got to put
boiling water in it and let it sit so it
can kind of like reabsorb to cup let's
see
you guys got to try this one to try it
whoa that looks like what okay ready one
two three
electron
just like mostly groceries because it's
dry isn't it
you're like I don't know what to think
about this because it's dry
oh the after chases really go yeah have
to dig that out yeah what's that over
there
okay first thought that seems like a lot
of extra waiting to get something to eat
like an emergency situation where you
need MRE
you won't have to eat right now right
look you're probably eat it right well
if you're at home you'd still have to
cook it and you know all that stuff
scrambled eggs you have to cook the
bacon you have to cook the eggs just
like yeah scrambled egg have percolated
long enough about time for breakfast boy
mmm don't that look delicious
yeah nothing like nothing like a good
old breakfast Ernie make a day Collins
