acquainted it was a fun birthday party
but here's the real the real deal the
first half I felt like death I couldn't

be in a barn
casual dress
clearly out in the middle
of nowhere

feel good this morning apparently you're
supposed to take antibiotics with food I
woke up and drank like three or four
cups of coffee and took my antibiotics
and then I was working outside in the
Sun without having eaten breakfast yet

so bad did it it was a really low man
