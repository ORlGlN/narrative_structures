scraped camera this guy you know what
we'll have to do we'll have to give this
one away to one lucky fan cuz I really
can't use it anymore it's got a gnarly
scratch on the lens so this one that I'm
using now could be my backup and I
really really need to get a new one oh
you could have it really no really he's
not kidding I was super excited to get
home to upload today's vlog and believe
it or not today's vlog uploaded on my
new upgraded internet speed in seven
minutes I was like whoa seven minutes it
only took seven minutes and it was like
a 15 minutes long I think so that's

just have one light and I'll set the
laptop up there and talk about I'll pick
the top ten and put them in a folder and
then I'll just scroll through those as I
talk
them it's really not that difficult

intricate the the fan art Fridays are a
lot harder of an edit than that than the
vlogs this is a fan art Friday timeline
