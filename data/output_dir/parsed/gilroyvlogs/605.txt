drive off three
damn bastard of so weird stuff on the
side of the road exactly on the side of
the road
silver annika could change the baby's
diaper
smelling some
very foul
yeah yo you see this towel let me be the
first to admit that this
it's the worst possible idea I didn't
anticipate it raining and it rained
harder than I've seen a rain for a while
and all the water just really comes
right down through here into the Jeep on
to the boys I should see if I can pull
this out and run the straps underneath
the weather seal I pass out for a nice
little nap 20 minutes
20 minutes
look at my snapchat and realize that
and get him
gotcha
if we don't pay no domes then Ito ain't
no rose Tamarac West Virginia really
cool spot and one that will clean that
up
really cool spot back there is like a
museum culture West Virginia pretty cool
this is where we eat gas up
and get back on her hopefully within 30
minutes did you just say quit flapping
around oh my Veronica took one from
Halle Halle you brushed up on this girl
she's been using backing her for past
couple days so we just ate the boys at
Burger King yeah

if you can hear wind or not I gotta get
those muffs on top everyone feeling
fresh check in at our beach houses until

beautiful dinner ready for us which
sounds great

too on the car sort of the kids we're
all done we're done we're so done done
night-night gas is a dollar 98
it's been forever since I've seen
gasoline for under two dollars that's
pretty good

point out like Virginia I like when I
travel I love to observe but the
differences between my new surrounding

this plane station steppe plantation
stat houses Virginia has a lot of
plantation-style house big yards big
houses

ton of palm or pine trees pine trees are
everywhere here and for some reason you
