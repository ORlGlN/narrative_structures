bright and early good morning guys
we got to go up to the Jeep and get some
of the stuff that we left in the jeans
last night like my coat
it's very cold oh come on what the hell
is this you say no beach you gotta be
kidding me
smart choice this is incredible Wow
buddy really evil right out there
continuously from one extreme to the
next
crazy snow we had rain last night
this is shaping up to be one crazy
vacation if you guys are seeing this we
survived if you are not then it was nice
knowing you
had to call in the crane on that one I
was so excited to show you guys like all
of the beautiful landscapes it's so
pretty driving through the mountains and
we're going over Blue Ridge Mountain
which is it's really pretty there's some
really incredible views up here but you
can't see nothing
yeah how's the drive so far Colin
the boys were playing way too much games
on their Kindle so I went ahead and put
time restrictions
on their Kindles it was so generous of
me to give them unlimited time to read
books I think that's really awesome but
only one hour to play video games
which well the rains kind of let off
which is great so Veronica will stop
freaking out Veronica's nerves are
destroyed poor Carson has to poo really
bad really really bad
this little guy back here decided he was
gonna go ahead and get carsick thank God
we have this little bucket which is now
I'm not gonna show you because it's
disgusting it's now loaded
oh that's great
now is full of
farm dog I always thought that building
looked really cool Hampton Coliseum
like a crown see a boat this is motor of
fun vote
don't touch the butt oh it's a bulb
we're about to go into this tunnel you
guys gotta hold your breath okay
there's lights in here
there you go
every time I go through a tunnel it
reminds me of that movie daylight with
Sylvester Stallone
and in the movie I think it happens in
New York and this tunnel collapses on
both ends and they gotta get out somehow
and all these people start dying because
they're retarded and finally they blow a
hole through the top of the tunnel and
then swim up to the surface welcome to
Curtin County kurtik County North
Carolina
that's where the Outer Banks is boys you
know where to add a Banksy is the curt
to County North Carolina there's a
monster truck loads
you want to ride a monster truck let me

camera likes to focus you know that's a
good thing about my camera that's well

of incidents with Carson being carsick

20 20 20 this company Twitty has the
area on lockdown if you want like a
condo rental or anything like that while
we stay in 20 is the place to go free
I made a big big mistake blew my lip
school inside the office they had those
suckers in a bowl and I was a sucker
touch the blue one blue moon that sounds
great with an orange or two yeah yeah
boy that's gonna be some good footage
I'm not gonna waste the footage once it
gets nice out like tomorrow I think or
Tuesday should be a lot nicer we'll go
we'll get some we'll get some GoPro
footage on the beach
like so you might think that he's crazy
but it's it's it's a well-known thing
that when you when you drive on the
beach and Scott really doesn't have to
because he has a bigger tire but when
you have a thinner tire it cuts through
the sand and if you deflate your tires a
little bit down like between 15 to 20
pounds it gives your tire more surface
area so you can ride on top of the sand
instead of cutting into it and get
yourself stuck it's bad news if you get
stuck we're getting to the point to
where I can show you why it is that we
love coming here and the reason is
because of where where we stay at and
it's not like anywhere else that I've
been to where you can just rent a house
and such kind of a like remote location
on the beach on the beach
it's Road boom the beach
this is our driveway

late you like the beautiful waves there
