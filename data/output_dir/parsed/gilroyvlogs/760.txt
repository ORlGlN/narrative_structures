anxiety when I know we're going out
which I want to go and I wanna have fun
and all that but I get this social
anxiety I think it's also I think it's
also there here let me philosophize you
are having internal doubts in your brain
it's the motherly instinct you don't
know that you should go out and drink
because your babies at home will not
home but at Nana's no babies flying I
know she's saying yeah but you just
gotta get over that and we're gonna go
and hang out with a bunch of people and
have a great time
and you're gonna finally be able to have

Hey
yeah
the clapper one of the many toys that we
discovered last night at Uncle Josh's
Veronica had a lot of fun last night I
just picked up our children they got
baby showers to go to
I'll bet from he's gonna be regretting
how well stuck in the mud there no but
Veronica had a blast last night she got
she got pretty tipsy let's just say so
how do you feel my love yeah just a
little are you are you gonna help me
edit this video and decide what we can
use look at me it's so cute that was you
dude when you're so little right when
you start first started talking he was
nude these kids are awesome I hope you
enjoyed watching us make complete fools
of ourselves last night I drove us home
I had my hands full with Veronica I
didn't drink anything so that's that's a
good note
it was a lot of fun Veronica definitely
needed that and I think she had a total
blast and I hope that you see through
the video that we had a really good time
and I told her on the way home
we need to go out just the two of us on
a more regular basis because having kids
we don't get to you know we don't get to
get out together very often and it's
important to focus on each other as a
couple instead of you know parents so
keep that in mind for all your parents
out there get out set a date night for
each other because it started with you
you know so I'm gonna get editing and
we're gonna start our day and I suppose
we'll see you right back here
