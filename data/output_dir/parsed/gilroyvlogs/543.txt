but I'm having way more fun trying these
tours out myself
burnout oh we're actually looking at
basketball hoops something to keep the
kids you know engaged active not stuck
in front of a screen you know which
happens all too often these days which
one is it uh I don't know we need one
that's adjustable 44-inch Pro composite
I'll backward huh Amanda's Amanda's
embarrassed to be in here with us
because we're acting like we're acting
like the coolest parents ever yeah now
we got to decide on a basketball which
one we're getting my regular one
n-c-double-a basketball we're gonna
black one I'm banking on the fact that
Carson I really is falling in love with
basketball but I think every kid should
have basketball hoop anyways and
eventually next summer I'm gonna have to
pour concrete so we can like actually
play a half quart size poker deck with
that we should concrete the whole
driveway
hahahaha daddy she's like what yahuda Oh

gonna take a nap I'm tired honey you got
all this I'm taking it now
oh crap oh all right I got this so look
I got the garage all blowed out with the
leaf blower much easier than sweeping
and look at that time of year to bring
all the bikes and stuff inside so our
garage is like super crowded yeah we
need storage space that's for sure
multi-storey pj shota stuff home boy I
got to give eka pill two of her wormer
medicine it's kind of difficult because
she has to like swallow the whole thing
we can't dissolve it she has to swallow
some about to give it to her take a pill
just put it in her mouth in the back of
their throat and then close their snout
and rub their throat till the swallow

build
echo now we're assessing the damage to
my car
look all the insides of the windows are
like nice and wet

wet I mean the seats are dried out a
little bit but back here it's it's it's
wet it sucks long enough runs not too

with so I think now I'm gonna do is pull
the car in pull off the shop back try
and get as much wetness as I can out it
just don't stop for me
don't stop uh-huh that's not bad not bad
considering how long the windows were
down
yeah and how much it rain now is
probably your cue to find me some
pictures of other people's cars on the
internet who had water damage so mine's
not that bad at all well I mean we got
it all swept out and best we can do now
is just let it dry just let her draw air
