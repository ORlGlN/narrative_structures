there's this huge debate going on right
now as to how we should go up there
because when you drive up there and you
park in the field behind where they do
the fireworks
you're literally stuck there for hours
after the fireworks done there's a spot
across from the park where we are hard
but even still it's a lot harder to get
out and then my sister and a couple
others are gonna walk from here which is
a pretty good walk but you'll be home
before everyone else you just gotta put
the work in so what do you want to hear
Oh baby oh yeah we need the Jeep you got
a point out on when word when we drive
past them okay point that Amanda
Merson right there point out him weird

crew of awesome kids Lindsey's here
