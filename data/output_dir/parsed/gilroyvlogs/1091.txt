these girls are telling me that it's
impossible to put sinan on your mouth
and swallow it basically and I know the
cinnamon challenge but I just want to
see how bad it is because we need we
need to do a challenge tonight but
trying to figure out what exactly so
let's see how bad this actually is
good
chewing it I'm trying to work up since
left I can't swallow that I can't fall
that give me diarrhea
I got it wet though oh I can't spin it
out
yeah tastes like it tastes like the
Revenge of a million cinnamon rolls in
your mouth I'm not doing that so here
I'm at the post office again send out
some more smile more orders spending
that money on the smile more merch
tonight we're gonna do another fun game
and that game is going to be you have to
put baking soda and vinegar in your
mouth at the same time and whoever can
keep it in the shortest amount of time
is the loser I'm not in this challenge
why not this one
TJ don't be a and I will put this
in the ball PJ pushing out on vinegar
and baking soda let it be known that PJ
wasn't out on this poster
yeah that's too bad because the
consequence on this challenge was a
positive meaning our Father I was gonna
send you to Cancun yeah okay still white
find her
all right the baking soda mixed with
vinegar watch creates a chemical
reaction we got baking powder instead of
baking soda but baking power still works
it's still fizzing I think this is a
consequence in itself man it is yeah
it's only a matter time for your mouth
can't stay closed any longer
so I think our little experiment here
scared PJ I was just took him home and
he doesn't want to do it like he's
afraid you might get a bellyache
okay 38 don't beep Dallas is here now
though everyone bailed who does that I
have an excuse because I'm a dad and my
kids are upstairs sleeping but that's
never stopped me from having fun before
why don't we just do it between the two
of us and see you can order it in the
longest what you would put in your mouth
you don't have to pile it just flat yeah
yeah that's half of a teaspoon that's
all that is no that's good that's good
boy son yeah just a little drop just a
little drop II
more
so here's the deal if it's just gonna be
the two of us I mean we have to do it
one at a time your first yummy go first
yeah
clog refers don't give nope all right so
just pour in almost a whole shop fill it
to the third the third cactus thing
right there okay that's good that should
be enough then half a teaspoon of the
baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon and the one
shot here we go
there's seconds it was almost immediate
no it was immediate it was with 30
points to 30 seconds
that's awful yeah alright so my time was
three point six three seconds Oh at
least I set the bar high for you bro
don't throw a lot powder in and then as
soon as you put the vinegar in ready go
oh no dude I hesitated on the on the
stop tap cuz that's just funny bro I
promise I really did hesitate on the tap
so it's probably even should we do it do
take two Oh
take two so you want more of that
in your mouth okay all right you're on
let's do it
oh yes number two it's not you time
that one was even lasted 2.61
