dunes here we are in Kitty Hawk Kill
Devil Hills I was confused it's all so
familiar they're so close together I'm
exporting the vlog right now on our way
to go to where my parents are staying in
a hotel so I can upload this vlog and
then we can continue and have some fun
and do all kinds of cool stuff
I can't wait are you guys pumped the
beach is like right there yeah what do
you think
yeah of course I do
while I upload this I'm gonna have to
definitely mom ah I missed you huh this
is vacation eh it is so windy up there
do you have any scissors I gotta put
wind screens on the old ham yeah well
you know look there's two mics on this
camera so I have to put I had to cut one
in half to put over here I hope that
works it certainly looks a little funny
but vlog is uploading it says 158
minutes hopefully it doesn't take that
long but we're not gonna wait for it
hello oceans hangin rough so we're gonna
go get some food having fun huh bumpers

okay thumpers coastal grill our other
half of the crew that were with already
here they said there's no one here
what up crew summer vacation hey Emma
are you dad happy vacation
check out the food spread fish tacos I
mean had fish stop this for a long time
I am pleasantly stopped that was good
xD I was good so now I think we're gonna
go I don't we don't have a whole lot to
do other than just kind of wander around
and just see stuff we're gonna go
there's a place around here called
jockeys Ritter just like this is the
biggest sand dune
what it's not it's not over by the ocean
it's like half a mile over that way
it's like a super huge sand dune
dude actually like
over there too
I remember we'll do that today but I
want I like camera up and do some hand
gliding and make some cool video
we might be doing angular
oh you know I just remembered something
the last time we were up at jockeys
Ridge it's very windy up there much like
it is at the shoreline and the sand
literally it's like seeing blast with
the wind just takes the sand straight
out yeah 50 miles an hour so I'm worried
like with our new camera here I take
that up there we're gonna get like a
sandblasted lens so if we go up to
jockeys Ridge I might possibly roll on
the GoPro or some b-roll BabyBjorn you
know it came up with a plan to you know
I have this I have these ridiculous tan
lines on my arms my neck I figure if I
get a couple tank tops I wear only tank
top flow I'm here and level out this tan
good call yeah yeah all right boys guess
what Colin look what I got here that has
a two line sport kite
we're gonna do some awesome sport kite
videos yeah yeah dude said this one
could potentially if there's enough wind
could potentially pick you up off the
ground so that was one of the things I
wanted to do this trip was get a cool
sport kite to make some cool videos with
it
I got it right here oh the boogie boards
did it yeah hit another one
how about this one over here oh yes
insane
that's funny
come on come on come on let's go look at
his shirt I don't know if you I don't
know if you can hear the wind because of
this thing but jockeys Ridge is gonna be
too windy to go on we're gonna try and
wait for a day that's not winning
instead go to the beach how about that
yes yes we're gonna go in there with
mommy
check it out all right we had to chill
up in mom and dad's hotel room for a
minute
your iliza ready look at it I'll get
this she's ready with her little hat
that's so cute
Liza you're like so cute you oh that is
so cool
we're gonna go down to the beach and
test fly this new kite Taylor you know
anything about these no well you're
gonna know after today okay the guy at
the store said well I can do flips and
turns and stuff but he said it's strong
enough to actually like drag me across
the same no but they similar just a
smaller scale even though I really love
to take this camera down to the beach
with the being super windy we're gonna
go ahead and rock the do press so
so the kite was awesome but I had to I
there's so many people on the beach
right where we were and I had to walk
out into the water
so that I didn't hit anybody
and I got hit by a wave and my glasses
fell off my neck why did I have him on
my neck I don't know
they were foggy from the sea spray so I
lost my glasses in the ocean after I put
the kite down Nick held on to it so I
could try and find my glasses and a
bunch of the strings on the kite got all
tangled up which we fixed so the kites
took it and we're definitely gonna pull
that thing out tomorrow but probably in
a more open space I'm just bummed I lost
my Raven I'm bummed she's not gonna be
in the vlog tomorrow what are you guys
