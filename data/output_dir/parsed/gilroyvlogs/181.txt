there are boot prints all the way up to
my front window like freakin really I
didn't walk up to that window I'm pretty
sure for annika wouldn't walk up to that
window and she doesn't have boots like
that so who's been creeping outside my
house isn't that the nice thing about
fresh snow outside your house you can
always see where tracks go look I've
seen some pretty awesome tracks in the
snow dogs rabbits deer but never boot
prints up to my front window is that not
cause for alarm who did that

warn me when someone's out there
Eko do you better do your draw bubblin
