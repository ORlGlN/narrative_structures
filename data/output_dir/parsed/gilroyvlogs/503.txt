okay let's go get tucked in
come on till the gladiators good night
so the kids stuck in bed they're fast
asleep I am going to make a breakfast
casserole that you put in the crock-pot
and it cooks while you sleep so that way
in the mornings it's going to get up
early in the morning breakfast will be
ready I'll show you guys how to do it
you want to spray your crock-pot with
some cooking spray a bag of frozen hash
browns this is a twenty six ounce bag
this is a 30 ounce bag
I seen you hash browns
and you want to spread it evenly on the
bottom of your pan so you get your hash
browns in there and you just want to
spread them evenly over the bottom of
the crack book 16 ounce package of
sausage spicy sausage or whatever a 16
ounce packet of sausage Brown it drain
it instead of the side you're gonna need
12 eggs you just want to crack those in
a bowl and mix them up slightly now that
you have the eggs all mixed up very well
you're gonna add 1 cup of milk to the
egg mixture plenty of salt pepper mix
this and I'm gonna set that to the side
now you're gonna take your sausage that
you've drained and you're gonna put it
over top of your hash browns in the
crock pot now you're gonna throw a new
cheese it calls for a 16 ounce package
of cheddar cheese
give or take if you like more cheese
more cheese if you like less cheese add
less cheese once you get your cheese in
there you're gonna mix all this up very
well the hashbrowns and the cheese and
the sausage you're gonna pour your egg
mixture right over top
and then once you have all of it mixed
up real nicely even you're going to turn
your crock-pot on for six to eight hours
hours yeah that's why you put it in
before you go to bed at night so when
you ate that one in the morning it'll be
ready in case anyone wondered those are
their beaches we're drinking no really
