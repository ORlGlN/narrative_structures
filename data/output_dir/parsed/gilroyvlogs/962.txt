all right here we go back at it again
today what's up I want to see if I can
really get you guys some footage I want
to show you guys some tips and stuff
that I've learned about doing product
photography which is essentially what
what I'm up to look how awesome my exit
is right now
it's a mess it's a mess so I had some
pretty gnarly storms that rolled through
your last night usually I want me to see
usually this little trailer park deal
yeah look
this trailer heart always floods
oh they fixed it usually that area over
there floods real bad so we broke for
lunch and I'm having a better decision
for lunch today grilled chicken salad
with egg I like French dressing I don't
do all that Ram I'm going to use just a
little bit because I know you just put a
bunch of dressing on salad it defeats
the whole purpose of trying to eat
healthy right and spends glorious Drive
home we're all done for today got a lot
of cool shots we spent most of the day
today setting up one of the pages of
this catalogue is going to have a like a
store display like it's called a gondola
and we put all the rope on it it's very
very hard it's very hard to build a
gondola hello everybody
he's just come he's taking a phone call
and I'm making dinner I am making cheesy
potatoes and some baked chicken corn on
the cob old yummy but anyways I'm going
to show you how to make the cheesy
potatoes like everyone wanted starting
to mix everything up you want just a bag
of you can use shredded hash brown
potatoes or like the cubed doesn't
matter sour cream mom cream of chicken
soup what do you want mister lego movie
okay can I finish showing them how to
make cheese potatoes and then alternate
on for you okay thanks and also cheddar
cheese now you want some of this to mix
in and put on the top so I got
everything I put the potatoes in and
then the sour cream and the cream of
chicken soup sour cream I didn't use the
whole thing I'd rather use not enough
and then add a little more if it needs
it instead of adding too much and then
we're going to put on some cheese
we don't really measure things you just
throw it into looks good
mix it up I decided it did need another
little scoop of the sour cream and lots
more cheese we see making cheesy
potatoes oh my kids don't like potatoes
the only potatoes they like are french
fries that's not even good for don't
forget some salt and pepper gives a
little flavor
sometimes I like to add like little tiny
diced onions in there I think you can
add like a cream of celery soup or cream
of mushroom soup you know it's pretty
basic and you can add as you like so
once you get it all mixed up we're gonna
look kinda like this like a stiff it's
kind of hard to stir and then I'm just
going to transfer it to a pan here
casserole dish just like that and then
we put the remaining cheese on top
cheesy potatoes we put it in the oven
and 350 for about 45 minutes
hey that was so good thanks for cutting
I'm a chicken for me honey

I'd like to mention at this point in the
next day is that it really sucks when
you when you film something and then
you're viewing your footage to make sure
you have all the points that you want to
make and then you realize that you
didn't have the last clip of the day
apparently I filmed the closing of the
vlog but it wasn't recording so so I'm
almost done editing the vlog for today
and I realized it I don't have a I don't
have a closing clip yeah I don't know
how I don't know how that happened I
don't know why I just know that we're
here right now together you and me

closing clip so we had to shoot it right
