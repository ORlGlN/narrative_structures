I didn't sleep very well at all and my
ears as you know I've been having a lot
of problems with the
I'm heading right now to the doctors
have another visit to figure out what's
going on and see maybe if if we need to
do something other than medicine because
it's it's really bothered so we're here
I'll let you know so check this out guys
I learned something new here at the
doctor's office
apparently the eardrum is as thin a
membrane as like saran wrap she says and
she looked at my ears she goes I can't
really see any redness or infection
which is good but then they can hook
these they can hook this little like
almost like a perfume sprayer the little
ball that pushes air up to the otoscope
and they can blow air into your ear and
watch how the eardrum reacts so normally
there's only just air behind your
eardrums so you should see it like go
back and then bounce back it should like
move but my eardrums on both sides she
said they don't move because there's a
ton of fluid back there so I don't have
an ear infection I just have a buttload
of fluid behind my ears there remedy is
to pump me full of steroids both nasally
and orally
they can't get me into it ear nose and
throat doctor until November 9th
honey it's official
I'm dying you're dying they said I'm
dying I'm gonna die I can't die you just
cut your ear off
you'll be okay without me well not
