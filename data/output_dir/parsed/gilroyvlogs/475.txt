what's up guys how was your day I hope
everyone's doing okay on the East Coast
with all your Blizzard snow stuff we're
gonna go try and play in some snow today
was sledding some snowboards you got
snow we're back they're just mean Colin
you ready Carson went bowling with the
friend of his for the day so we're gonna
go have our own fun as you can see the
snow situation around here is it's
pretty limited I'm hoping
fingers are crossed that there's at
least a little bit of snow that we could
sled on or something
but worst-case scenario Scott's got
Scott in his
it should be fun either way but
check this out Scotty got a trailer well
it's not his trailer someone else the
family's trailer it's the family trailer
I didn't know they had it can you
imagine driving out to your mom's in
this weather do not get the other day in
my heart oh my god I was literally
pushing the snow with my my bumper oh my
god so the plan is they don't have kids
tonight so Veronica and myself we're
gonna the kids are gonna stay at my
mom's and baby lies is gonna hang out
there for a few hours and we're gonna
just have fun in the snow as adults we
had to we had to kill fair amount of
time waiting on this girl how much like
we've got left it's time to rip and ride
dude put your boots on well I'm telling
you it doesn't look too promising for
snow on the ground we're sledding you
know what I mean
there's no snow really
Collin how we gonna sled with no snow oh
go
so fortunately we came to my mom's house
the boys are staying the night here
anyways and I mean we kind of dropped
the ball on the whole sledding thing
well we wasted enough time is the
problem Wednesday I think I thought a
woman yeah it is a woman thing so we're
just gonna drop calling off now and we
are gonna go out there mess around
I do LM a sledding trip though oh no
with the lights on yeah look at that
that is a flippin awesome scene
the moon is so super bright for all
so basically Scott and I left the house
Veronica is feeding the baby and her and
Lindsey are gonna come out after they
get some food and we're just gonna mess
around out here in the woods at night on
the four-wheeler
well it's freezing cold what else there
I know right this is back in the trailer
you guys for those of you who don't know
I I have never not a lot of people know
this actually but I have never driven a
trailer because I don't know how to back
one and I feel like I should totally do
that that would be a hilariously downer
video since you want me to navigate you
out if you back straight up now
but you should turn the trailer that way
there you go now back straight up
there you go bro that's the ticket that
looks good
that's Gucci it's way more snow out here
than there was in town and he's not that
 miles away yeah dude this is crazy
that's way thicker this is yeah we could
totally hook up the snowboard and pull
behind the quad but do you want me to
what oh geez okay oh my goodness
so many rules who veronica's finally
shut up we're all getting dressed and
we're about to go on - cool all right we
got two four-wheelers that's good you
guys just slide it down the hill just do
it again we want to see that we want to
see it come on
sure be careful watch for cars by
they're gonna tip over
yeah
so we're outside you can't see anything
but Veronica there's our taillights
we're down the road quite aways in this
little nook I don't know if you can even
see anything we're just four wheeling in
the snow with a full moon how awesome is
that bean is Oh

there we go all right so we got this
strap hooked up to the four-wheeler now
we've got the snowboard we got my snow
boots he's gonna keep going we'll just
wait I think all you had to do is hit
start where's the key the thing is like

fast

gonna be pulled behind on the little
plastic sled there like that can't see
nothing here let me get you guys some
light one corner and they're gonna be
tipped oh my god they're gonna go
straight for that little outhouse
so there's a pretty awesome like big
track that goes up and hill across the
flat down we're gonna do that right now

this dude is ready for bed yeah it's
late it is late I just made the most
ridiculous plate of nachos I still think
it goes this is happening I'll be honest
I didn't last for the whole movie I fell
asleep on the couch and then we came up
to bed at like 4:00 in the morning but
now I'm up I've got my coffee it's time
for our Sunday morning livestream and
that's that the stream is over we had
some fun I was doing really good
we played halo 5 today I played a match
and SWAT is my favorite game but I
played a match where I went like 28 and
7 was my best game so far SWAT did
pretty good I even got a killtacular all
you halo fans know what that means
but it's just past noon we've just ended
the livestream well time for me to get
to my edit it was a lot of fun to just
cut loose last night and just you know
have fun I guess as adults even though
it was only for a couple hours it's
always nice to kind of have
that break and hang out with your
friends as friends you know at one point
we were cool people and then we became
parents you know what I mean
so like we don't get to do that kind of
thing very often so I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video make sure you come
back tomorrow as soon as the kids get
home I plan to have everything done so
maybe possibly we can go back out with
them and do some sledding or not but
judging by the look of things it's quite
sunny today and everywhere the sun's
touched it's like melting the snow so I
don't know anyways thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you guys have a
fantastic day we'll see each and every
one of you right back here tomorrow
