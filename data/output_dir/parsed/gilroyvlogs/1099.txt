Christmas tree I'm not sure why exactly

don't we just throw the tree out the
front door oh we could light it on fire
I was only kidding
I promise we won't light it on fire okay
okay so I guess we won't be lighting the
tree on fire now we need the boxes that
all this stuff goes in so that we can
put it away for 340 some days all the
happiness of Christmas fits in these two
little Tupperware boxes I remember now
why we haven't taken anything down yet

happy boxes I don't think it's gonna
happen is it oh my god oh all right do
