playing with Carson's new Nintendo
switch super mario obviously the coolest
Mario game literally ever this things
cocoa keys yeah yeah we had a lot of fun
swimming yeah yeah you literally passed
out
a Power Move I honestly did not realize
that the Nintendo switch was so unique
and simple it's just such a different
thing like it's a it's a giant Gameboy
like if you know what the gameplay is
it's like a giant like the 3d ass or
something that has way more capability
