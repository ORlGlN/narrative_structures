you want to tell everyone behind us and
we're all gonna tell you what the
surprise is the surprise is super
excited we all of us don't let me fool
you I would definitely definitely enjoy
some time at the beach we definitely
need to get out of here
and reset have some you know you know
you know yeah so we waited a few hours
to get some rest before we left because
it had save us a hundred and fifty bucks
for a hotel room to just stay home for a
little while and sleep and then drive
are you ready is Eliza ready she looks
ready who's ready to go to the beach
early it's like 5:00 I
6:00 in the morning we should have left
at 5:00 so hardly an hour behind the
drive should take 12 hours but we have a
baby and every time she needs to eat
we're gonna have to stop so this could
be interesting
that's been a few hours watched a
beautiful sunrise you saw beautiful Sun
while everyone else was sleeping just
started grunting back there so
that means she's gonna she's hungry she
hate right before we left which was read
for six
and now it's almost 9:00 so she's
definitely Pro hungry
Dufner made it to the Tamarack in West
Virginia the best of Virginia what they
say that's where I'm going do you see me
switch lanes like this Veronica would
definitely much rather Drive and then be
driven but I'm the man I will drive and
this is our mobile our mobile sanctuary
boys getting juiced up where's Colin
how's the car ride so far she's pretty
much been quiet except for when we saw
the sign for this place all right Colin
wants to show you guys the penny machine

squishing a penny keep going keep going
oh there it is I want to try it says you
are very special to me
all right everyone's fed including the
baby yeah I wish I could get some of
that but to be honest needs a little
sugar it's a big mountain huh Carson
right there
Americans oh look at this look at this
boys
is it awesome you want up there
climb it put your legs up there get your
feet you can do it Oh can't you're a
mountain climber
yeah yeah barn nice
you can see a barn we had to stop and
check out the view actually when Dennis
and I came through here to go see Taurus
we stopped at this very same scenic new
spot it's awesome so awesome that was
fun
did you enjoy the view yeah I enjoyed
the view too baby
one of the best purchases that I have
ever made was that service right there I
mean you know I love coffee I made
pretty much a whole pot fit in that
thermos and it's still super hot
all right third stop always got a pee
baby's gotta eat just right we'll get
there like Thursday restroom pledge huh
you know look at this place it really
shows huh okay one whole hour later we
finally get to leave and I get to sit in
the passenger seat I've been driving for
six seven hours oh yeah that way
somewhere somewhere over that way that's
where we're going so here's where we are
at 5:12 p.m. just north of Norfolk
if we would have left at 5:00 this
morning we probably would be like
somewhere down here by now and then what
sucks is usually we stay in these
beaches up here so we have to go all the
way down here to this bridge cross over
and then go all the way back up so it's
like don't want the distance look out
the window over here so first look at
some ocean for the day
the harbor
I know that destruction you mean
construction
I think that's a coal maybe
welcome to North Carolina as the sun's
getting ready to go down we started this
journey while the Sun was coming up and
we'll end it while the Sun Goes Down by
the way I see a few people tweeting or
commenting about the way I handled to
give away for that camera and I gotta be
honest there's really no other way to do
it because every person who comments
it's just like it's just like if you're
on a dating site online and you're
talking to someone you don't know if
that person really is who they say they
are so you know what I mean you can't
really you have to take everything you
read on the internet with a grain of
salt and I feel like the only true fair
way of doing it is treating it like a
lottery of which you don't have to pay
to enter you know you just have to be a
gladiator that's all so everyone be
thankful for the giveaways there's more
to come so it's not the last chance yeah
just be thankful
that's p.m. I mean it's pretty
self-explanatory you just have to take
care out of the tire 20 psi
Thanks forever but it's cause for
celebration because we made it we're
gonna get a little lost at the beach
looks totally different totally
different nothing's recognizable
everything changes the sand blows around
the dunes change the roadways change
it's Turkish that's like where's all the
houses we didn't even see how let's get
back out of this car what are we doing
dad hey mom dad we made it we missed you
