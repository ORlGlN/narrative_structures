together took me about 15 minutes to
throw together some lasagna and I put it
in the oven and I gave chase
instructions I set the timer on the oven
gave him instructions to when the
lasagna is done take it out put the
crescent rolls in
once the crescent rolls are done don't
burn them can't have burnt bread with
lasagna and then it's time to eat
