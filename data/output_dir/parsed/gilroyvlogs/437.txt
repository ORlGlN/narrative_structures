what's up guys how are you I hope
everyone's doing just fantastic today
Veronica leaves tomorrow to go out of
town for the weekend I don't think I've
really showed you guys what happens to
Elijah when I turn the vacuum on watch
this turn the vacuum on this is your
warning ready here we go
she used to be like really really scared
of the sweeper now she's just like it
still freaks her out but she's okay with
it
Eliza is ready for a nap yes if Veronica
I'm pretty sure I've mentioned it but
Veronica's leaving for North Carolina
tomorrow to help her cousin move back
home for personal reasons so she's out
right now getting her hair done before
she leaves I'm really excited for her to
take a little trip because I I get to
travel and go places fairly often and
Veronica is always stuck at home and you
know she was gonna drive down and it's
it's pretty pretty much as far as we go
to the Outer Banks it's a very long
drive and I've almost sworn off making
that drive in one straight shot so
saving her all that hassle I decided you
know what you should hop on a plane
because she hasn't flown for quite some
time as well and so we got our plane
ticket her cousin Amanda's going to so
all the cousins are getting together and
they're gonna help amber move home which
is really good really good
Carson should be home any second and
it's also snowing again look what
happens as soon as they can move their
groove to that let's make a JIT let's
make a difference though look here boys
break the link breaking the link all the
financial policies yeah and they have a
tax have you ever heard of stick buck
yeah you saw those at Walmart yesterday
yeah stick by studio something that
Zumba Xena I think they're stuck bust
anyways my idea was that this weekend
right well mommy's away as long as we
can manage we could do a test episode
but in order for us to do a test episode
see I can't even film any of my life
reviews I haven't shot the Ronin thing
yet because the downstairs is I'll have
to just show you yeah this is the
current state of my my workspace
Veronica came down here and started
putting stuff in bins and well you can
see how far she got but they're still
sawdust over here from when we made
those shelves I was thinking about
taking a corner there and put in like a
couple of shelves like finished shelves
with toys on them and stuff and make a
little corner set for the boys to do
that like the the toy videos the toy I
guess you'd call reviews toy reviews or
something Colin what did you say
What did he say you don't like it :
I do well you're not supposed to say
that to a woman what's mommy got in
there Liza yeah you want those don't you
some graham crackers always inspects the
groceries when when my grandma she like
