and back on the pool mission so this is
much bigger than a one day chore you
have to like I'm on step three I swept
it yesterday I skimmed it shocked it
last night this morning we have to do
the stabilizer and then we have to do
algaecide and all that stuff it's it's a
process there's so many extra hard
chunks till that shock I did last night
it dissolves almost immediately so I
guess I have to wait for this to fully
dissolve
that's the leaf situation right now they
are constantly falling and I don't know
if you could tell yesterday but this is
totally green we put that stuff in last
night and it's looking way way better so
I'm going to definitely get all these
leaves out here we'll add the stabilizer
when it's fully ready and guess we'll
close the pool I'm sad man this is like
it's full manifold here it's time to
time to get cold
