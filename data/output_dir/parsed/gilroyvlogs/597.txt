sunshine look at that
put on your sunglasses kids look this is
what the sheriff's are all around in
down here these little off-road vehicles
he's talking and driving
they get mad at you too if you go over
15 miles per hour on the beach which is
pretty slow they'll pull you over they
usually won't write you a ticket but
they'll pull you over and say stop back
this is your sea turtle

popular it's probably one of the best
spots to eat around here especially for
seafood at night so we wait and we have
