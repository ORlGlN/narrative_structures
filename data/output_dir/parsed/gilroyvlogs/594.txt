don't know if there's enough but I'm
hoping the sobering reality of returning
home yesterday was it was so cold last
night

brown and that's a good sign of the
impending changes in the weather fall is
upon us

texted me Veronica stepdad taking this
like hey you're feeling brave you should
come over for a minute immediately my
interest is I what do you mean if I'm
feeling great Christmas brave feel brave
all day our day so we're gonna see
what's going on but inch wide half-inch
long about cried this is about cry this
is what Jay texted me about this little
guy right here is what they call a
Carolina Reaper and it must be the
hottest I believe it is the hottest
current length oh he wants me to eat it
I say nay
I didn't say all of it what do you just
you said you ate a sliver of it sliver 8
inch by about a half inch and you're not
dying I was for about 15 minutes
ha ha I don't want to feel like that you
feel brave come see me come on
I love the camera I'll bet you will
I bet you will I guess I'll have a
sliver on it it's that really look good
it is a good looks like a Reaper what
the heck your gloves on he want me to my
mouth is watering already
I'm supposed to have dinner here shortly
and this might ruin it you might not
taste it for a while
I'll cut it down when I get it all all
right yeah that's the size ie and you
had a whole cup of milk and crackers I
will give you well you can cut down
every you want that's about a third of
what I eat you want a smaller I don't
know well don't do it don't touch it

restroom or something and use a left
hand you're gonna pay for that

can't even imagine what was how that
would be if someone had a whole entire
one you'd be dead you just took a bite
of it burning pieces canning these jars
of this is pepper butter which I'm
really excited because I'm out and that
is so good dip like pretzel rods or
pretzel chips into this oh that's just
the bombs really my consolation prize
from being punished to my taste buds you
were warned ha ha
Carolina Reaper is nothing to mess with
if someone says try this Carolina Reaper
pepper just don't I warned you yeah you
did warn me thanks for the punishment
and the pepper yeah hi baby girl

she is so happy to be home
she couldn't roll round on the floors
anywhere where we stayed for various
reasons but she loves being on the floor
and hanging out rollro
come here yeah so after dinner I think
it's time to reclaim my bedroom if you
remember when James and Holly came over
I had to take apart the crib and put it
in our room so that they could have more
room inside a licensed bedroom
I still haven't taken the crib back
apart to put back in there so that's
what I'm gonna do after dinner and set
up the little gaming station up there
for the live stream I don't care what
you say to my house simple spaghetti is
still still on my favorite dinners I
just love spaghetti angel hair pasta
hamburger meat beef and then sauce is
questionable I like a multitude of
sauces this particular one is like
Carfagna civilian it's just mushroom

guys for today I was actually really
interested you can tell by the title of
this video that I tried yesterday the
hottest pepper in the world and I wanted
to make sure that I could title this
video that by doing some research and it
is true the Carolina Reaper has been
rated as the world's hottest chili
pepper by the Guinness world record
since August 7th 2013
and I only had a Betty piece and I'm not
only was I paying for it yesterday but
also paying for it this morning if you
know what I'm saying that is one bad
pepper Oh this week is all about
development before Veronica has her
surgery next week which very kind of
nervous about I have to get some things
done before I can't get anything done
I'm developing a website to replace as
you know I used to have a store called
gladiator stuff calm it's still out
there but it's not functioning you can
still look through all the stuff but you
can't buy anything so I'm moving the
store over to a new website that
hopefully will be a lot easier for not
only me to manage but you to access and
use and I'm coming out with a quite a
few new designs a couple designs catered
towards Legends of Awesome so I'm also
working on those graphics for the
legends of awesome that I have coming
out the legends of awesome trailer and
episode 1 is so close I I just don't
want to put it out there until it's
fully ready and it sends this the right
message get your subscribe buttons ready
tomorrow I will show you the link to go
to Legends of Awesome and subscribe I
need to get I think 500 subscribers on
that channel before I can do custom
thumbnails and a custom URL and that'll
make it easier for me to say go to
legends of Awesome to Binstead of this
stupid alphanumeric URL this generic URL
I'm just trying to get as much computer
work done as I can to make some big
waves in the YouTube pool so thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you right back here tomorrow
