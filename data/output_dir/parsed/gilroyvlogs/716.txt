you guys first day back home trouble in
paradise look at this look look at the
temperature in here 81 degrees and the
airs been running for a couple days so I
go downstairs and look and I noticed
some dripping on the black it's like a
insulated black line that comes in from
the condenser on the outside let's take
you outside so I come out here and check
this and this is the first sign of
trouble
ice ice Oh No
and then the condenser inside there it's
all covered in ice I don't know if you
can see it yeah that is not good so I'm
no expert at this and I think that that
means either the fan isn't running or
there's a problem with the condenser and
being a home owner now this is my
problem so I need to figure out how to
fix this and I remember one summer the
old landlord came over to check this
thing because they had a similar problem
and the fan could be stuck so we're
gonna take these bolts off and see if we
can't make this fan spin freely
well just as I suspected the fan is
spinning freely if I lift it up here I
can it hits the sides if you move it a
lot but the fan is spinning other than
that I really don't know what to do
gosh that sucks I know we initially
didn't need to let those lines thaw and
then we'll try try it again but I think
I should probably consult Google at this
point unless there's any HVAC gladiators
out there who knows some tricks have a
brother out
quick google search has told me that we
need to do some troubleshooting and I
can't do it right now because it's
raining unfortunately but we're gonna
have to let it fall out first so that's
gonna be at least two hours and
unfortunately I have to drive halfway
back to Cincinnati right now to meet up
with Dennis because he left his camera
in my car in the back seat so we're
gonna go for a little cruise we made it
hours an hour you know what I mean
especially when you're looking at dad's
old look at that dark cloud and looks
like a looks like a freaking play a
tornado freakin tornado found me a
