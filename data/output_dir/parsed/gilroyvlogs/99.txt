as I mentioned in the end of yesterday's
video

diagnosed
strep throat so our inclination is that
maybe Liza brought home some sickness
that we now carried with us on to
vacation so we're trying to protect I
don't want nothing either we're going to
try and find some Tylenol or sore throat
drops or something to help Veronica get
out of bed because currently her and
Eliza are back out
leavin we came here for entertainment

are entertained to me that's for sure
