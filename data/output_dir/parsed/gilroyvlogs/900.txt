what our family good morning it's a
beautiful day other than the fact that
it's in Chile I'll tell you what I'm not
looking for to fall weather
I need I'd rather be hot you know I'm
heading to Best Buy because they need to
get a pop filter for that microphone
that I just got today I'm filming a
brand new tutorial for my new how-to
channel for a guy like me this is my
favorite store favorite store nice take
out one left they must have been saving
it just for old Gilroy
you know while I'm here Veronica is
eligible for an upgrade she still has
the iPhone 4s I got her the iPhone 4s
when it first came out so now that the
iPhone 6s are available
I'm gonna surprise her and see if I
can't well it's only pre-order now so I
have to see if I can preorder one and
get her the newest iPhone so how weird
is that Best Buy said they can't
preorder the iPhone six-plus but they
can pre-order the iPhone 6 cause a
little confused and said alright then
I'll just go to a Sprint store so we're
going to my hometown sprint store to get
this all figured out
apparently select I've been with Sprint
for a long long time over ten years and
because of that I guess I'm a Prime
customer me and Veronica both can get
iPhone 6s for a hundred and twelve bucks
it's lost so gilli gonna be getting a
new iPhone 6 which I'm really super
stoked about the only problem is they're
all on backorder for four to six weeks
I'm pretty bummed out guys because
something is not right with this
microphone I came up here I'm excited I
got this pop filter setup and I got it
all hooked up but the microphone it's
not working right it sounds awful here
let me listen listen listen
these external speakers hooked up to the
microphone right this is what it sounds
like wasn't oh my god
testing testing testing and it sounds
like it sounds like game all the
way down this is the game all the way
down it's not it's not nor mmm this
isn't gonna work this isn't gonna work
I'm gonna have to send this thing back
buyers on Amazon you gotta kind expect
that sometimes if you order stuff it
might come to get a defective so don't
get your hopes up too much you know I
mean order in advance and just make sure
you it's really easy deal with Amazon if
you buy something that doesn't work just
file the submit returns and then you can
send it right back at school we're
