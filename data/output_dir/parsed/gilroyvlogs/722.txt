a dream for me to have enough room
inside a vehicle that we're filming in
to have a tripod we've got plenty of
channels I mean plenty of windows to
film out of it's all tinted - no one can
see in we can see uh
I need to get a good Town he's official
he is official good unfortunately we
have a little delay one of the walkies
that we need to use doesn't have enough
juice so we're gonna charge it up
that's no worries because we've got a
ton of stuff to film so we're just gonna
postpone the one and then move to
another easy right oh yeah wait to see

breakfast chorizo pepper jack bagel
sandwich how's that diet had to run in
Walmart really quick to get some
supplies before the videos we're
shooting today tennis balls
I need tennis balls trust and i are
shooting a couple of quick tips for the
review and how to channel yeah I came up
with this idea to use sometimes you need
to put your tripod on like a dolly or
slider and they're pretty expensive but
a cheap hack is using tennis balls on
the inner tripod to use it as a dolly
then this can't pass by one of these
things without playing it it usually
wins who you got so pissed in that
library over the machine you can draw on
the place one if it's written are those
packed on their prime you can turn I get
that
oh wow yeah you got it
no damn okay oh man that looks long
point definitely oh it's too big it's
never gonna grab it okay you could get
that counted Tom why I love the smell do
you listen this a samples of Herbal
Essences these are awesome
is it yeah man you know your shampoos
have not done it easy there
I don't know hey it's because I live at
the wood huh oh yeah Jimbo got you some
you got these hook you up huh I got some
from Walmart - yeah no it's fine you can
use them on your tripod I got a hack
that's gonna be awesome for you awesome
