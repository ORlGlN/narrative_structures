outside we're just fine not complaining
they've constantly been on their iPods
in video games we're going to try and
make sure that that is to a very bare
minimum over their summer break I don't
know if I mentioned but my my drone
parts came in so here's the shell here's
the other motor that I need and this is
the me I guess you call it a bracket the
gimbal bracket so I need one more tool
to actually complete this repair which
is like a soldering gun or soldering pen
because I'm going to have to desolder
this motor right here
inside and I think all the LEDs are like
melted into the plastic there's like
little plastic studs in there so we're
going to have to get into I'm like
actually dying I want to do that really
bad me and my boys we're going uptown
we're going to get a soldering pin like
I just said because I want to fix that
this weekend
and then you guys want some Dairy Queen

cream
Oh Veronica's too tired to move so we
left her now and I just got that saying
like this temperature and the humidity
today feels like we should have a
thunderstorm and boom right over there
there's a big one coming I was gonna go
and wash the Jeep but here's the upside
of thunderstorms Washington keep for me
so RadioShack was closed but Walmart's
got this really cheap soldering iron
it's only ten dollars I can't only
imagine how good it works but I mean all
it really needs to do is heat up and it
comes with solder you need solder you
need like rosin core solder instead of
acid core rosin cores for like
electrical components and stuff like
that and add some chords for like toys
and just random ish so this will work I
mean if it doesn't I can always take it
back we got some inside supplies and
drinks some snacks
I think this storm is going to last a
little bit so we're gonna consider
tonight
