listen here's my advice to you parents
out there don't ever ever take your kids
into the toy aisle at the dollar store
because they want it all don't you
I see it I see it the primary purpose of
our visit was to find glow sticks when
one the glow sticks for the boys ones
when it's time for fireworks the guy up
front says we don't have glow sticks but
I know you can make it at a mountain dew
and what are some other things so I
googled it all we need to make our own
glow sticks his Mountain Dew baking soda
and hydrogen peroxide so we're going to
try it

this bad boy out
Oh hit it again
now instead of just shooting wildly into
the target field we have here we got
that board we've got these paper targets
we're all gonna have we're gonna set
four targets up and I guess whoever gets
the closest it's the winner it has to
replenish everyone else's stock of ammo
no it's just for fun fun give it an
objective it makes it more fun
I didn't breathe 30 yards 25 yards all
right dad goes first
nope no go ahead all right Josh will go
first something's wrong with this game

walk and shoot with the judge I'm gonna
I'm gonna hit the target every single
time go so I guess while they're
shooting me and Samantha were left in
charge of cooking dinner and I don't
know how good of a job I'm doing I've
never ever grilled before doesn't look
too bad
they look about done I don't know what
the sides look like but that's
char grilled chicken I guess this is a
big piece sue that looks like Samantha
make sure it's done burning these these
little bright things those are like a
bride what they got jalapenos in and
watch out Sonny hey I don't know
they don't come though you know in there
when it's cold we're stuck in this
ridiculously long line for the fireworks
this is such a small town almost every
single person that lives in town it's
coming down to this really small park
and usually we walk but we thought maybe
we'd just drive this time for no good
reason at all are you kidding me
you don't remember the last tear
the year before that we rode with your
dad I parked at the realty place all in
the back of the truck yeah well we
walked across the street we walked
across we walked our street so then we
won't we didn't walk alright here we go
this is our spot in the middle of the
field well it's not woman is it blue
Oh focus it's not glowing it's not so
that was a complete and total fail
apparently Mountain Dew baking soda Russ
I do not well
the Somerset Independence Day
celebration turned into let's everyone
wait in line for food while we celebrate
apparently apparently no one ate dinner
before they came so one thing you might
not know about Veronica and she has like
a social anxiety
well she seriously does she gets all
nervous when she's out in large crowds
how are you feeling right now
they're good okay because there's a lot
of people well there's a lot of people
here the boys really want cotton candy
so we're gonna weigh in this really
short line
yeah working like a q-tip from outer
space
holy cow hold it up hold it up to your
head let your head disappear that's
awesome dude yeah just me my boys my
wife hanging out in the summers night
everything on Kandra no good yeah look
you got a you got a cotton candy goatee
bathrooms me oh look at this long line
where it goes that line goes to the
bathrooms I'd be a really bad time to
have to go pee
grandpa grandpa's getting the kids he's
light-up sores that's great we have a
fish stick not heck no we don't need no
fishes Tom and I don't want to
officially
Hey Hey look who we got what do you
think about that dude really you already
killed it all right take a picture of me
you should know by now oh geez
so fireworks are getting ready
chronica you're about to be so sick
stuck in the car look at this nightmare
oh right now is not the best time to
have to pee I'll tell you that
this is a wild this field straight up
straight up turned into a parking lot
there's only two exits ones way down
there the other ones down here obviously
everyone chose to go out this one and
it'll be at least 45 minutes to an hour
before we get out of here so it was such
a long wait there's still no movement in
that parking lot we're hoofing it we
decided not to wait any longer we're
walking it's not that far from park to
my mom's and we're walking
I'm some tequila three shots three of us
for now thank you
he was browning up
shakeela
oh I feel like dead
the boys went with my mom after the
fireworks right and we found ourselves
shortly thereafter in the in the bar we
didn't want to wait we didn't want to
wait to drive out of that ridiculously
crowded parking lot so we walked up to
my parents house with the boys and then
we went to the bar and had a few shots
of tequila I might add so Veronica was
very gracious and didn't drink to drive
us home which was awesome
but I definitely definitely feel it
today you know that pressure in your
head when you've had too many drinks
the next morning yeah I got that so I
woke up at 11 o'clock you gotta go get
the kids I gotta go see my homeboy wrong
dog before he leaves town again and I'm
a little too hungover to do all that I
will press on I have no other choice
we will see you guys right back here
today
