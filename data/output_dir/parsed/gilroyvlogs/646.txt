check out Advance Auto Parts and then
check out Zack and then check out
Advance Auto Parts now I'm trying to
edit the vlog in the car on the way to
help these guys get the parts that they
need to fix Dallas's car so you can get
the heck out of my house basically we
have to go to a place called pick and
Pole which is essentially a junkyard you
go and pick the parts take them off of
these cars yourself yeah but I don't
have the 1 inch and 1/4 socket that we
need to take off the hub nut maybe
that's what's called so Dallas had to go
in there and get it that's pretty good
timing actually we're almost there
I just finished the vlog exporting
uploading might be an issue I don't
I have hot spot on my phone but I don't
think I have good service so you ready
to do some work you ready get your hands
dirty yeah it's gonna be tough it's
gonna be tough I'll tell you what Scott
had the advantage yesterday's using
power tools air tools we don't have that
so I hope you ate your Wheaties for
breakfast right picking pool where you
can find pretty much any part you need
for a really really low price what do
you think it's gonna be like 25 bucks
hopefully so when you come in and you
tell them what kind of car you're
looking for let me give you this
printout and there's like aisles and
rows all number and you got to go down
and find the aisle and the row and
you'll see your cars good enough right
is that the one there it is right there
bro it's your lucky day found what we
need now we're going to do exactly what
we did yesterday all over again
soft shit huh your discretion is advised
this is like a family bonding experience
when you know we get to come out here
and the blazing hot Sun wearing black
t-shirts totally sweat our balls off
together trying to fix the car that
really isn't worth it now I need a
smaller what's your name
or Corey Corey hooked us up with some
essential tools that we needed having
nice thanks so much man yeah I have
actually yeah oh yeah man thanks again
take it easy
hmm all right we got the piece we need
the only problem is we couldn't get the
rotor off and you can put bolts in here
to make it pop off but we shredded the
bolts so we'll have to get creative
once again all right here's what we're
talking about right now me Zach and
Scotty I'm all invest in time to help
Dallas fix his car we spent all this gas
taking dolls around set tomorrow
so here's what I think should happen I
want you guys to come up with something
that Dallas has to do to pay us back for
helping to fix this car
I wanted to be some kind of public
embarrassment so in the comments section
I want
put down there what Dallas should do
in exchange for us helping them fix car
nothing sexual
