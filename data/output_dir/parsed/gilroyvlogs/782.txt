what's up what's up look what I'm making
what I'm making oh it's nothing but it
will be oh hey watch it lady
you're in my way you're in my way I'm
doing these stick sandwiches again with
onions cheese I'm so hungry
huh what's that you want to see how I do
it I'll show you we're not using all
those onions just these onions no butter
I'm gonna cook those first you know what
I mean so that so that they can get all
brown and caramel and delicious and put
all them flavors in the pan so that when
I put the meat in it it's just gonna be
packed full flavor here's a little tip
if you want your cut veggies like onions
specifically when you store them put
them in water they'll live longer you
just drain them out when you need them I
use hamburger buns cuz that's what I got
I'm gonna toast those in this pan real
quick before I cook the steaks real easy
mmm that didn't take long
nice nice crispy bun I will put those on
now it's time for the steaks
I'm going to use two for one sandwich
because they cook down and last time I
just made one not enough good thing
about these little steaks even though
they're frozen they cook pretty fast
shovel some onion on there
check out this flip put your spatula
under one side of it boom so you fold it
nice and easy
whoops and then put some cheddar on this
one stack this guy on top of it and then
put some mozzarella on the very top now
I'm bun I'm doing Miracle Whip on the
bottom spicy brown mustard on the top
and boom awesome steak sandwich whew now
it's time for round two
hey wait for that on the one to finish
on I'm gonna destroy this one while it's
hot good mmm

I know that lights bright huh it's funny
I just got done cleaning up dinner and
got all the kitchen and everything
cleaned and I was heading downstairs in
the basement to film a tech tutorial and
Branka here walk in the door awesome
crap so we'll get to that later but this
little girl is all I want right now
little girl
I just realized every time every time I
look at Eliza or show Eliza no matter if
I'm filming or not I always get that
high-pitched like Oh Baby Talk but it
seems to happen to everybody anybody who
comes to see the baby they automatically
go into baby talk you going to baby talk
everybody doesn't it's like the thing
huh oh girl that's right let me try the
opposite oh gosh where I baby oh you're
so cute yes you're cute so I came down
here to film a quick little tutorial
someone asked me how do you record the
screen of your iPad your iPhone so I
made a cool little tutorial on that it's
actually really easy I was just sitting
here thinking like look at this thing
that I built this set if you will I mean
it's pretty simple but it's what what
the symbolism is behind it like if you
remember a year ago almost over a year
ago I started this channel because I
wanted to
I was working such crappy jobs I was
making decent money but I hated it and I
wanted to do something that I loved and
one thing I did know was that I loved
making videos and I loved working with
Roman Dennis and we were an awesome team
and he asked me one day at beat up he
goes he goes what do you want to do
like what I want to do is is what I love
and I love filming videos and I love
editing and I love being created and the
whole purpose of this channel this vlog
channel was to help inspire you guys and
myself to show that if you put enough
work into it you can achieve your dreams
it is highly possible so like because I
put all this faith into myself and I
started doing it I was you know coming
up with different clever ideas for the
vlogs to make them funny or different
ways to make cool edits and then I
spawned this how to channel because I
love technology and I know a lot about
it and just comes easy to me
so like tomorrow I have a phone call
and we'll be discussing this new idea
for a new channel that I think is going
to be incredible
100 percent viral and humanitary human
humanitary I don't know what the word is
but you know it'll help me help other
people too and I'm really looking
forward to it and my end goal is to show
you guys like from start to finish I
started this channel just quit my job
and all I wanted to do is film videos
and then through this journey we found
our passion and I get to show you that
if you put enough work into it you can
become great too
yeah I just came up with all that I just
wanted to share that I was sitting here
looking at my lights like man we're
really doing this aren't we Harry just
called me upstairs says hey it's time to
get these kids to bed I can see why cuz
