good time and appreciate just being
alive and look look outside it's
actually kind of pretty but very cold
very cold out we got a weather advisory
is that you protect a sensitive plant
from the cold because our trees are
including out right yeah but it's
literally frigid out
hypo knee to lower spine hey guys so we
kind of skipped past the worst barn I
actually didn't even go in the barn
because Tess and I had some like
business stuff to go over

between doing that and I'm really dark
on there we go

we've already gotten Scott Lindsey here
as you can tell and we're about to start
to grill
one of my favorite things ever if you
didn't know by now all right get ready
oh yeah here's the thing
it's March the 11th should be a little
bit warmer by now
totally 20 degrees foot thank you yeah
freezing cold but we still grill them
nah just your mystery right back on the
case again today
yeah do one it up again look at it
patting him up he patted him I watched
him fatty and he put them in that
container well I didn't either look ha
ha ha
look at me I'm actually really
disappointed in myself tonight because I
don't I don't look she got she got
already patted burgers right and what
sucks when you do that is you don't get
the opportunity to put like for Chester
char
say that three times that Porsche a
chart are perfect if you don't get the
chance to like really do them up so it's
not I'm going super basic
with a Larry season so no today's vlog
is not sponsored by Larry
we went inside to get something that
came out and this thing was just like
boom because Veronica got 80/20 you got
when you're cooking on the grill you
want a less fat percentage right so when
you see the beef in the supermarket
80/20 is not good maybe for like
spaghetti on the grill it's always
ninety ten that's shirt on that's what
you need tell them stuff that's right
that's right yeah sweetie need all those
grill marks nice look at that
there we go Mike it's the cheese in it
Oh buddy my achieving it an amazing take
these two hold it over your honey dinner
is prepared
aha it was a weirdest thing - there was
this a foolish guy came out of nowhere
right she was he just came out of it
while we were grilling and talking about
our cheese stuff crazy crazy thing II
look at this beautiful meal we made I
know and Lindsay Lindsay made the
potatoes Lindsay made these bacon cheese
and or there is a ranch on it already
no look either way boom time to eat okay
so we're putting alcohol and veronik now
I'm just kidding it it's peroxide why
that's the only reason yeah it loosens
up all the wax and dirt what do you mean
she got a lot of wax in there I mean I
don't
honey let me see in your ear I know do
you have dirty ears yeah intercessor
definitely you come with me
I totally agree it bubbling Bronco can
you hear me no no I mean let's shake it
around you're just right this is good
I got this regard too much for us I
think we need to evacuate the scene yeah
when people start putting peroxide in
their ear that's when it's time to go to
another environment Brian this is this
is what our aim is for now another
around the tape leg all right so what's
up and yet we're still up there church
