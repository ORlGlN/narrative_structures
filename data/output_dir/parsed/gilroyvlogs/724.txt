gonna do this Josh and Sam are taking
off what they have to give me my
invitation this is yours guys - Scottie
I'm that guy right yep this this real
clue thing is totally happening there's
the secret information you see ya old
chap all right guys we figured out an
instagram hack so you took a picture on
your DSLR and it's too wide Dallas what
do you do you screenshot it you turn
your phone sideways and you screenshot
it yep and then open up Instagram and
it's small enough to fit you have one up
before right where it didn't turn out my
Instagram my friends doing some weird
stuff right now ha that was before
that's yeah they're cut off
so basically what it does is it shrinks
the picture and adds black bars so that
all the sides can get into the shop
pretty neat
think Liza you ready go home yeah
we've been here literally all day all
day
let's go grandma bye whoo look what
showed up this is our blue apron box we
decided to try something new which also
you guys can get in on but I'll let you
know more about that in a second but
basically this blue apron is a food
service that sends you to meals a week
and you have to you know obviously sign
up for him what an output basically you
choose the kind of meat that you want
and they send you these two different
recipes per week and what we got was
baked empanadas the picadillo and
crunchy chicken tacos yeah so they fill
this box with all the ingredients that
you need to make these recipes and
everything's right here inside we've had
limes garlic avocado onion arugula so
