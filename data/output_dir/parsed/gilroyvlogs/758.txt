a blue one the Canadian super balloons
ready look at her yeah what wait don't
worry cuz ready we got a long day ahead
of us
why don't you wish our gladiators a
Happy Easter
presents we're about to be surrounded by
women all day who want nothing more than
to just hold that little thing right
there Randy oh she got cross yard man
we're late let's roll we gotta go person
what what's the true meaning of Easter
uh-huh now that is on camera please
and gone egg hunts
face-painting
see baskets of candy
like f ing yeah
the true meaning of Easter who comes
from the Bible is that yep you'll read
about it today at church it's the day
it's the day that Jesus rose from the
grave he was crucified on the cross and
they buried him in three days later he
rose
what would they do a time
I don't know you'll have to ask your
Sunday school teacher
ah this we're on our voice turn holiday
I am NOT a highly religious person never
have been Veronica's family very
religious people and it's weird for me
to go to church and to also learn that
Easter because unlike most other people
on Easter you get an Easter basket full
of candy and that's and then you get
together with your family but not I
don't think a whole large number of
people really know the actual meaning of
Easter so I'm gonna work today just like
you are if you don't know don't pick one
Oh Nexen lucky you can't out there there
I don't even know why I'm coming I'm
coming
it's my favorite thing ever did you
learn anything honey
I don't know if I learned I didn't learn
something
but I learned that I have even more
questions and I have four story that I
got was that an angel came down when
these two women were coming to see Jesus
and two angel comes down and says don't
be afraid are you crying Jesus isn't
here
but where did he go and who saw it
that's my question
if there were guards outside too
then where did he go
that's my question we're gonna go car
sanity go out across where'd he go after
he rose in the village to the village
huh he went to Burger King he was hungry
now we're off to be
Miss Piggy's
the dinners
mr. Klump
now we're going to celebrate wasters not
about it well the dinner and the family
and being together and all that well
Oh God we made it to our first stop and

mom's arm it's a really unfortunate
story that goes along with what happened

from the beach and we pulled that we
stopped at a gas station and I showed
you my parents came in shortly after mom
came to the Jeep to bring the boys
licorice snack on and when she was
walking away I wish we could reenact
this and be so know when she was walking
away right in front of our Jeep was like
a curb two feet wide it was raised so
she steps up on her and then steps down
off the curb and she steps down off
curbs
she hit it hard fell right on her face
where's the thing where's the paper on
the desk right there this is the x-ray
and right there this is her ulna radius
