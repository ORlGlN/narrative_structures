G's tell me what is that again I would
explain to everyone what Carson's trying
to avoid saying directly is that Miley
gave him that sticker she's a girl in
his class and he smiles like this every
time we talk about her I think a little
somebody's got a little some little
crush hey I just kicked somebody really
oh you look like a guy hit by a truck
smelling have some tacos
you should be proud that I got a fire
started today yeah and you didn't use
flint and steel how hard is it to light
a fire with a blowtorch
would use a match or lighter Oh for
pete's sake woods and find twigs really
yeah no it's like a weird vlog like I
started yesterday at dinnertime and now
I'm gonna continue today
as I'm driving the Cincinnati alright
with PJ PJ is coming with I'm gonna
teach PJ some things because I want him
to be available for me to use as far as
filming in the future so PJ is gonna
learn a lot of valuable stuff little
trip and we're going to film with our
buddy Mike I think you probably know him
you saw him in our
vlogs mic hun sucker good friend of
Dennis Roady well you know and a good
friend to all of us actually so we're
going to film some videos for him and
have fun doing it and PJ's gonna learn
some oh boy
alright let's roll check it out I'm
working with lamp para on a nice little
secret project so I had to stop here for
a quick minute
you know what I've dad hey kinda had to
snatch and run cuz I'm in a hurry to get
to cincy but had to stop and talk to
Brandon we might be actually doing some
logo concepts for the natural born
pranksters movie which is really really
exciting and I had to scoop me up a new
shirt that are listening to us talk this
whole way it's fall why don't you enjoy
these pretty beauties
so before we get started we gotta we
gotta fuel in the tank man I haven't
eaten yet
you're gonna do you're gonna do me at
Chipotle we're gonna do me doggy style
or what ah ha ha you fell for it
in case you ever want to know how I
build my bowls it's the same every time
you get the brown rice corn the tomato
salsa fajitas barbacoa sour cream cheese
lettuce and then use your chips treat it
like salsa
how's your burrito
there's a word yet so we're gathering
all the stuffs that we need the props to
do a couple of videos and one of those
props that we need is to we need to
build a camera hide and this will be
different than any other hide that I've
ever built before I think you're gonna
like this school it's gonna be really
cool what I'm thinking of we got all the
stuff we need here's the basic rundown
I'm making a camera hide out of this big
giant box it's just big enough for me to
fit in and we're gonna fix it up right
so what we're gonna do is we're in take
Plexiglas right and window tint which I
it's inside and we're gonna cut out a
strip all along the side here and all
along the side here and put Plexiglas
that has window tint on it so that I can
be inside this box and film out of the
windows it's pretty genius so this is
how we're gonna do it
now once you get that edge line up and
it's got to be perfect because it's
exactly the same length
you got a squirt at the top once we
start laying this down so you can use
the squeegee nice and wet okay
and use your squeegee to lay it from the
very edge all the way towards me nice
firm pressure all the way back
all the way back keep going keep going
keep going
yeah
precision accuracy to look at that hit
that panel of hidden camera awesomeness
like a mere man good enough for what we
need
can you see it can't see it at all shut
up put it over the white valve whitening
nose
driver my window please check it out
guys this is the most awesome cardboard
box camera Hyde ever look at this just
duct tape some plexiglass I can see
perfectly mr. hudsucker but I will put
some up there yeah either way this is
gonna work awesome spy so we got our box
in the corner where it's supposed to be
for our shoot I'm gonna get inside and
see what oh this would be an accurate
lighting situation for that time today
we're going inside here
I doubt it
ah here look look at it with this here
look at it with this camera from the
outside
gladiators can you see me
no what the is that like
wouldn't you be like in the corner like
we saw you waving your hands a little
bit I gotta say that's a pretty good
looking camera hide man I can't tell the
difference you'd have to really look at
me like it's not really a dishwasher
ooh no you know it's it's a camera hi
I'd be like that that's a camera hide
that's camera there's a camera guy in
there two years in the making
black mold the wall yeah parently
