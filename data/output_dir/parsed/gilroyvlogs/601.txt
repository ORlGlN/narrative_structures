what's up guys welcome to our vacation
grandpa's got the boys in the pool
figure it might as well join
what are you doing are you gonna stay in
there all day no you want to see if we
can go to the beach yeah everyone else
is still gone we just got done swimming
for a while we might have to take a
little trip down to the beach I wanted
to take my stunt kite out there while
everyone was away and preoccupied get a
little practice in but I left it in the
back of the Jeep I can't stand hot no
I'll bet it is you just can't feel it so
we had to take a break from the pool to
make some peanut butter jelly sandwiches
that's what boys wanted they'd love
peanut butter and jelly I wanted to
focus some time on making sure that
they're having fun because taking the
babies on vacation is really difficult
you know I don't want the boys to feel
like we're only giving attention to
Eliza and she requires a lot of it
sometimes both of us so some piranha go
to town with the baby so that I could
play with the boys and after we eat
these peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
I'm gonna take them down to the beach I
in the water a bit and then probably by
that time Ron called me back I hope she
brought me some tank tops I need to work
on this tan there is your peanut butter
and jelly sandwich my sir okay you want
to carry his for him don't drop them
here
I can't my hands are full Oh how's those
peanut butter enjoy sounds as dudes nice
I was so nice and hot out ah beautiful

my mom's way up there they took my stunt
card I'm so mad we could have went down
on the beach with the stunt kites dudes
and rocked out the stunt kite but now I
got away and everyone will be down there
that's dangerous you can't fly those
things around people I learned I've done

we've been here by ourselves this whole
time right when we leave everyone else
