Friday but but that's the joke right
April Fool's hot-hot more more or
something right

everyone we have skipped forward to
afternoon I had to get in the shower and
all that I mean the boys played outside
for a little while I am allowing them to
play a little Minecraft just for an hour
so they have been doing good on their
behavior so I thought I'd allow them to
play for a little bit I feel bad I'm not
really doing much today I'm just kind of
waiting right now here in a couple hours
I have to go to the new barn and I'm
gonna ride up with the lady that
moving the barn to or while moving the
horse to so we can pick up ninja we're
using her trailer yeah I guess it's time
for lunch
let's see what we can find for lunch
they wouldn't get to take your blankie
pretzel and cheese sauce was calling my
name I tried it it's decent
tastes like a pretzel but it's nothing
like what you get like as appetizers at
restaurants and stuff like that why you
say mommy what oh she wants to play
babies let me have that baby baby it's
so very nice treat the baby Oh where's
the baby's eyes

like baby talks when you talk to where
Suzy up to talk like baby talk to
babies and horses and end you ready
say goodbye and you know you're not
moving very fast come on come on
okay go get new buddies come on come on
come on I hope that he loads up in the
trailer okay cuz he was always a
stickler when it came to loading and he
never wanted to get in the trailer
so let's hope there's fresh hay in there
for him so that might entice them a
little to get in there a little easier
took her back in to just show her the
feed we're gonna kind of change up his
diet a little bit but you gotta kind of
ease horses into it so I'm just letting
him eat some grass here Humbaba
huh hmm but yeah she was saying that how
cute he was and how like over their
place they say show like I used to and
she's like we're gonna get you back on
that horse and you're gonna be riding
you're gonna want to show I probably
will truly miss being in the horse you
know
guru whatever cuz every day are our
lives used to revolve around horses and
so I'm excited to get back in it have
him closer to home and get back in and
get back on this big boy and ride huh
Sanja what's going on he sees that open
trailer you won't get in there he won't
get in there see boy Oh
