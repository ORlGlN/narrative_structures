bench press superset with barbell bent
over row so I'll do the bench press and
then quickly hop over to the bent over
row and then go back and forth for four
sets I'm ready let's get it Monday
mornings it's nice at the gym because
there's practically nobody here except
for the there's a bunch of old ladies
that work out here Monday mornings fit
right in that was a good workout super
sets make you feel pretty burnt brought
my protein with me today because I'm
going to get my hair cut and I got to
tell you guys I actually am starting to
become addicted to the feeling you get
after you're done with your workout like
I feel strong
let's just say I'm digging I'm digging
the whole workout thing
let's go get this haircut so just like
last time I'm going back to this
barbershop right here boss
they do a good job and what I really
like about it is the hot shave lather
lather shaving cream straight razor on
the back all right guys ready to see my
new hair are you ready I think me and
the barber had a slight misunderstanding
I know it's good cut but kind of kind of
really sure okay I was like I want the
top to be a little shorter than it is
now
you know what straight up I'm worried
I'm worried that when I walked in the
house Veronica and the lies on the boys
are never going to recognize me
I don't think I've ever had this shorted
here ever
does it look bad
now rocket
which sounds a not blog for two weeks or
something
where's mommy
were you thinking my hair what well
Veronica's in the shower so I can't
really uh you know I'd be mildly and
appropriate for me to vlog Veronica in
the shower so I'm gonna eat I'm gonna
get some fish and find some other stuff
maybe some rice eat a nice big meal and
go finish the iPhone video I've been
waiting for my nose and my voice to come
to clear up so that I can do the
voice-over and not sound like a weirdo
mm-hmm
maybe soon uh yeah so I'm gonna finish
the voiceover on that and hopefully get
it up today this week we're gonna really
focus on getting back on track I feel
like the last week being sick I haven't
ridden I haven't really been bringing
