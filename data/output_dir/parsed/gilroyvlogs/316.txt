start to the day welcome to the vlog
how's everyone doing hope you're doing
fantastic
I look some we're gonna have a little
bit of a change of plans
for the next couple days it's a little
bit exciting right now we are taking
care of some business and I've had to
come uptown to you know do that
beginning the month type of stuff pay
the mortgage get the car baby blah blah
this building's been here for as long as
I can remember
a little fun fact that building that st.
buildings being torn down back in the
day when I was like still in high school
working for my dad I used to wash those
windows I will say this I going on a
little last-minute trip for a couple
days with a buddy of mine down south
about four or so hours can you guess
where that is
so I'm bringing this camera finally to
see if I can get it repaired but
she seems good Fitzie
bloomer the lady said they couldn't even
ship it because it doesn't have a like I
cut my coverage warranty or anything
because that's the one I got from eBay
what would you do in this situation
would you contact Sony Direct say hey
need this fixed I don't know what to do
we should look for an online repair
manual to see how to crack these things
open and then order parts and fix it and
then I can make a video where are you
going look at your diaper look here your
diaper hold on we need to change your
bottle eyes oh my goodness look at you
look at your pretty dress oh you're so
cute you don't need that sweatshirt it's
hot out you can go sign play yeah that's
right let's go come on Dora the Explorer
lies this back there exploring check
this out you guys remember a couple days
ago I showed you this pool was quite
green I think or did I put that stuff in
it the algae stuff check out how
crystal-clear it is now it is
beautifully crystal-clear however you
see all that that's all algae debris
they called it and you have to have a
pool vacuum to pull it out I don't have
one amber just had fillings I'm assuming
that her and Veronica had dentist
appointments together like twinsies come
here let me see you
your face is numb from my eyebrow down
do big smile are you numb too
you don't look very now Oh Jason you
never went the pool vacuum one might be
able to use so Jase go to the rescue and
he's got a bigger pool
I guess vacuum right but our connections
aren't really the same this hose is a
lot bigger than our input for the who
that might work no my that might work
the other way would have been so much
funnier though this might work I don't
know he's trying to put two of the same
size hoses together flush to hold them
so this pump will work let's see if it
were holed up I'm plugging did you take
the plug out of the jet side no okay if
it did okay I mean I can pull it I don't
know if you did or not I didn't know how
