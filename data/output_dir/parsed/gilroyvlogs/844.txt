this watch just Merry Christmas guys
Merry Christmas I want to show you guys
a couple of the coolest toys I've
probably ever seen in my life let's show
them the dye now first this is like an
animatronic pet here only two wheels and
this thing balances all on its own
watch this
it's pretty wild you can drive them
around with this remote I think the
coolest part about that toy is that it
only has two wheels and balances on its
own that's pretty sweet
Carson got this Zoomer
puppy dog which is again just incredible
you just push down the head and they're
both charging but you push down the head
and it listens that one doesn't have a
remote at all it just hears your voice
and you have specific commands you can
give it yeah
pretty dang cool one of my favorite
gifts halo the Master Chief collection
in all of my experience of playing games
on xbox the very first Xbox I got was
because of the game Halo and I I i have
pretty much every single one so I'm
really excited to get this one is
supposed to have remastered halo 2
multiplayer maps which I cannot wait to
dive into all right check it out it's a
nice little mount for my desktop
microphone for doing the tutorials and
stuff and this will also come in handy
here when we do video game videos what
you think I like it I like it
is it awesome or what yeah yeah I can
swing it right over and just record
slide it over I like that I like that a
lot under on Colin's birthday yeah it
