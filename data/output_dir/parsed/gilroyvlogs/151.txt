that's on my route whoa
18 seconds whoo good is all around
what's happening guys welcome to a
beautiful day in Ohio we are breaking
out well Christmas toy is that the kids
couldn't really use yet epic little
scooters is that fun whoa whoa Liza you
did it
whoa so yeah guys it is a very beautiful
day it is a perfect day to like get
outside and do something super cold on
what a really pleasant break in the
weather couldn't ask for anything better
so we're going to spend the day as and
as much of it outside as we can love us
is going to ride a dirt bike filling it
up oh you came and see in there you fill
it up with some fuels and arrived at
their bike I'm going to focus on
charging some drone batteries because I
want to fly then too long and probably
get some work done outside as you can
see our yard is a absolute disaster you
thrown gravel in three seconds
oh yeah hey you might want to let it
warm up dude it's a two-stroke oh god
I'm out here picking up trash and stuff
in the yard and hear that buzzing around
my neck is that it's Collin applying his
little drone show me dude
you're actually doing really good Wow oh
I would definitely try and keep it out
of the mud so he almost landed right on
my camera I'm calling you get good
enough with that I'm gonna teach you how
to fly phantom Zach tell everyone what's
going on with Caleb right now I don't
want to talk about it I know you don't
want to talk about it not only either
but we're gonna have to let everyone
know what's going on because like all
the sudden the students just going to be
like why were scale about what Casper
did freakin gone Caleb Caleb is quitting
allowed he's quitting Ohio I'm not
quitting him where you going Caleb
giving it a break for a little while
got to get out of the adventure woman
back to North Carolina yeah where he
grew up a little while
i'ma give him such a hard time he's out
he's leaving us when we go to wish him
the best of luck
Caleb's going back North Carolina's
never seen you on the news or something
and not for robbing the bank
I don't know if I would go that far but
I don't think you would it was pretty
easy I would just in transition yeah so
gotta check this out we I just put lots
of the bed right and we picked up this
pet containment system it's essentially
just a wireless and
visible fence for the dogs to keep them
in the yard and stop them from running
away before we actually set this thing
up and put it on the dog and just assume
that it's working I thought we would do
an actual human trial
are you excited echo this is a new toy
for you it's great you're going to have
so much fun with it I promise
haha that's crazy
for real listen they're huge
avoid leaving collar on pet for more
than 12 hours per day okay oh my gosh
haha
we'll probably mount it on the side yeah
like that you still trying to help me
set this up err
all right you guys you must be busy
come on man you can't be scared yeah
it's going to be fun dude a lot of fun
bro this is like the best thing that's
going to happen today
alrighty then
alright before we put it on anyone's
neck we're going to figure out where
exactly the boundary is this goes all
the way up to 8 so I guess we'll we'll
put it on like 4 that's 4 we'll see how
far it goes and that sound is like oh
I'm about to get shocked are you
trusting me I good man
yeah it's awesome no that looks great
good know just like a dog would do
what's up snapchat it up bro just
like a dog would do I want to take off
like you're chasing after a cat or
something of my hair it looks great yeah
you think he promised it's not on max oh
yeah I suppose I was all out super good
dude just me pass out like you're fine
no you're fine oh ha ha ha all right was
it how was it definitely I didn't know
was going to keep doing it yeah for 30
seconds past the boundary I'll do it so
wasn't that bad right I wasn't that bad
right so we'll hurt the dog you know
heck no no well you get a mark on his
neck
dang really had it pretty tight yeah I
was pretty tired I just missed it angel
I let the dogs out to go over there
and colon is out here flying his drone
like he just was at you ago angel got it
tell them what happened tell them what
happened
don't go get hit it goof off with it
don't worry dude it's alright I won't
get you leave I promise
Oh better one I bet or make a special
request oh don't worry we got these
collars make sure that never happens
again ever ready okay oh that is bad
you're not doing that I will Caleb do it
come on all eyes on you side the circle
I don't like that it's not that bad not
bad
we just did it alright well I guess
all we have to do is alright I wish -
you say you're brave enough to max
volume you a maxim
I guess alright I'm hit turn it up to
maximum that's what we're doing Zach the
dog the doggy dog yeah that looks good
alright now here's how we're going to
gauge your level of pain if you get to
the boundary and it hurts really bad
you're just gonna have to keep dabbing
while you're being electrocuted just dab
it out and everything will be fine
wait wait okay yes zoom in nah that's
what the dogs are gonna do bro they're
gonna be like oh crap
take off take off back like you're
trying to break free
look at it hmm you can do this oh you're
not dabbing wait you didn't go any
farther
oh oh I was wasting y'all to death Lucio
there's not much there
oh that was no joke what level was that
on Oh sick
don't do that to the dog really that was
no good way to go
drop me I just don't want to give money
whatsoever
yeah no idea that was going to happen
really dang zoom sorry bro
I like brought tears to my eyes holy
crap
was it really that bad you have to do it
now what are you going to train us on
the gladiator honey hey daddy yeah that
I feel weird teddy
that did it so Carson don't ever try
this crap alright it's really dangerous
and bad but we're trying to make sure
that this is a safe for our pets you
know what I mean
good thing we're not gonna do it just
listen yeah pretty good thing yeah
Oh God
did you hear beef now
hahahaha oh whoa whoa oh my god dude
that hurts bro whoa oh he got me four
times lip so I hate us for shot like a
four burst ah gee that's all like that's
not like every part of me was like yeah
at least you didn't drop to the ground I
know I don't know why I did that
don't ever put these on max because that
is not good your dogs would be fried
bacon out in the yard when you come home
okay so we did it on one and we did it
on six so I think like four echo a level
two would be appropriate and four angel
probably level six is good for Angel oh
you're probably like alright where's
where's Veronica quick headed that's dad
so so basically uh yesterday and that's
part of like the reason we didn't vlog
yesterday and today Veronica is spending
as absolute much time over at her
grandpa's as she can because you know
he's uh you've done and you know they're
just you know spending time together as
the closest part of the family you know
celebrating his life and being there for
him and taking care of him stuff I am
taking care of the kids and making sure
that she doesn't have to worry about
that would be really tough for her to
focus and spend her time with then
if there was kids running around and
being loud and stuff like that it's just
she's doing what she needs to do right
now and that's been in time then you
guys could just give her as much love as
you can
she needs every little bit of it you
know it's all support in the world would
mean everything to her and to me and I'm
trying to figure out something nice I
think we should before she comes home
tonight I kind of want to take a little
trip in town Eliza should be up from her
nap and maybe go get her some flowers or
you know a little card or something just
to make her feel better you get out of
here go see good to your people I'll see
you soon this one should we get flowers
no that's no no no I'm not bright pink
flowers I'm thinking something a little
more classy like like something like
this nice assortment or even some roses
move we can get a combination of red and
yellow because yellow stands permit
remembrance you know what I mean
those would be nice too
like a poem a Native American prayer
guide which i think is very very pretty
I am with you still I do not sleep I am
A Thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints no I am the
sunlight on ripened grain I am the
gentle autumn rain when you breakin in
the morning hush I am the Swift
uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled
flight
I am the soft stars that shine at night
do not think of me is gone I am with you
still in each of you go I think that one
you like that one okay
