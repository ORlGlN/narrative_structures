night car see I did miss it I had to do
them number two ski you what I go into
my office and hear these girls out here
like jumping around literally doing
workouts at ten o'clock kind of strange
I promised I'd tell you guys why I
didn't vlog yesterday so let's do that I
don't think I want to explain the exact
reason why didn't love you Esther day
with some crazy things have been going
on lately and one of those
one of those things like directly
involves the trip and it wasn't anything
like really bad or anything like that
just just maybe the opportunity to
express the moral of the story that is
don't count your eggs until they hatch
the long story short is like you expect
certain things to happen and you base
decisions based on those things and then
they don't happen and that changes
everything so yesterday was like
yesterday was almost like a day of
defeat for me and I had this like
internal struggle where I honestly
didn't know if the tour was gonna be
able to happen but I really got down to
the nuts and bolts of everything and I
figured out I figured out a lot of
things yesterday took the time to put
down the camera and really put my put my
brain to work and I figured it out so I
mean I guess I wanna I just want to
explain to you guys that that even
though even though something seems like
it's gone terribly wrong okay and
there's and there's no way to come back
from it there's always a way always a
way you figure it out no matter what
there was this moment where I had the
severe doubt as to whether or not I
could pull it off and I actually sat
down and put in the work and I and I'm
making it happen so if everything seemed
bleak I want you guys to remember that
there's always an upside there's always
that positive energy that you can put
towards whatever it is that seems like
it's not gonna work out it will just
believe in it if you believe in it
enough it will happen that's my piece I
had to go and start a drinking water I
wanted something
it I have some more work tonight and
someone's coming to see me so look who
showed up
we've got a lot to talk about
it's been a long day meet some my hair
Dell's just left good to see him glad
Dallas is good we'll talk more about
that story as it develops but that is
where we're gonna leave you guys for
today I want to remind you to please
please please join us for the live
stream tomorrow we have kind of a
special event you can join me at twitch
