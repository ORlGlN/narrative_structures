what's up guys welcome to our dates
it's a beautiful and sunny Sunday
afternoon my favorite Liza
guess what today we're gonna build our
bed with the help of my dad
he's an unofficial carpenter officially
your unofficial unofficial look with the
mad scientist has put together all these
dimensions and stuff all of which are
pretty close to what we want but you
know we're building from scratch here
some things might change we've already
changed some numbers on it well one
thing's for sure we're gonna have fun
you ready bye sweetheart
I love you
but here we are back again hellos we're
hunting down materials this is what
we're gonna be looking at all day guys
wood wood wood wood we just got all the
this these pieces would be the supports
for the actual platform set 18 pieces
now looking for these side rail pieces
not sure how we how we should go about
this one
this reminds me of when I was much
younger
and I would go with my dad and help him
work on projects me I was always going
to push the cart but since he's helped
me with this I'm more than gracious to
have his help stops what's it's kind of
cool to have this opportunity to spend
some time
there's our wood that's gonna be my bad
people we've got all the pieces we need
now we're going to choose the the color
I'm looking for a nice dark kind of
cherry finish obviously polyurethane
like we did that the desk that I built
or the bench what you got oh it's gotta
have a toy in my mind
Oh so guys this is my this is my take
all my would what does it cost for my
wood
we're building a bed yeah thank you so
much Cheryl all right now it's time to
take this load it up and to the shop
well here we are the wonderful beautiful
the exciting wood shop that Grandpa's
back there doing his thing you wouldn't
believe only a couple days ago that guy
was in the hospital he don't stop I've
definitely designed this bed to be very
tricky to construct I wanted to use
interesting jointing to make this kind
of stand out and where I want like the
headboard to meet the side rails I want
this like really cool joint to go in and
we have to do because they don't make a
4x4 that's not pressure-treated well in
our area that we could get today so we
have to use two two by fours to glue
together to create the headboard
structure for the side vertical
structures and I want to join them
together like that and that's just for
the headboard side rail joint now down
here at the foot rail we're doing
something really cool
by taking this block this is like a
top-down view take this block and make a
four-way cut so the side rail comes into
it when the foot rail comes link to that
like that
but the side rail foot rail is kind of
half cut out so they have like a like a
u-shape and they will kind of leg out
together and I think it's gonna be super
super cool if we can pull it off
we're putting the actual support of this
headboard together the intricacy of the
headboard support vertices will blow
your mind we've reached the point where
we're gonna put the back onto the
headboard
we got most of the headboard
completed we ran out of these boards to
complete the back what to get more of
those we have another board that goes on
top and then two sets of crown molding
that there are two levels of crown
molding to go here we've got the side
rails cut with this little dovetail
joint kind of that goes right here in
the in the edge of the headboard support
and then we've got these big giant these
are my big pillar feet they go on the
bottom corners by the footboard and we
just have to have these they're gluing
so we have to wait till they're
completely dried have this idea to kind
of turn the bottom so it's rounded and
then we have to get really technical
with these cuts up here we'll explain
that as it's happening because it's very
it's very tricky tricky tricky well we
we've reached 8:05 p.m.
and it's we still haven't eaten dinner
here's my love hey would you meet me
tortilla soup and breadsticks and salad
