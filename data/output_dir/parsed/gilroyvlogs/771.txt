right there it's it's pretty cool and
I'm just
it's kind of broken but still like this
is my first find this year it's kind of
broken on that side but super neat so I
have to tell you guys this crazy story
about this dream I had when I was
pregnant about the Outer Banks I did
this exact same thing I got up early in
the morning came down by myself to the
Virginia state line in my dream I'm just
walking down the shore looking for
shells and all of a sudden like the
clouds part way and this huge castle
appears like a castle you'd see from
like a storybook all of a sudden there's
this big rock and there's this mermaid
up on this rock and the waves are just
crashed and behind her like something
you'd see from like the Little Mermaid I
look over and the clouds partway on this
other side and there's this other huge
castle and another mermaid and I was
like what in the world I was like I
crossed over to the Virginia state line
and it was a whole new world it was like
real life I was driving just like this
down the beach and then once I crossed
over to the Virginia line it was it was
a whole new world I got my shoes on
so this is what I found I didn't walk
for very long because as I said tide was
in so there wasn't much that the ocean
has left us but yeah I found a few
little things this little ones cool and
these little crab shells I guess this
here still hook together this one is
just awesome I love the color of it it's
a really bright orange sometimes you're
just fine like the the case of it the
outer part of it I guess who do you mean
I don't know I just enjoy this I also
found this which I grabbed him brought
back with me because stuff like this
should not be in the ocean I seen
something on Facebook the other day it
was one of the like plastic things that
go around the set the cans of soda like
a six-pack of soda and a turtle had
gotten stuff in it and it kept growing
and literally the middle of the turtle
was like SQUOZE in to where like they
had constricted the turtles growth it
was so sad
Veronica woke up and left me in bed
which was fine cuz I'm tired
good morning Carson did you have fun
hunting yeah yeah a picture of Veronica
on this episode Porter's and she she
confesses to the audience that she just
she can't live without all these shells
and she comes into her house and it's
just filled surrounded with shells we
should do an episode of shell hoarding
