good morning everyone we've got some
I've actually had juice and some coffee
it's quite early we gotta go
that's right guys our Key West day is
over that's not the end of this
adventure we're on our way now on the
road for many many hours to Atlanta
Georgia to meet up with our next legend
of Awesome
goodbye Palms Hotel when we first got to
this place
we were like what is this it's not your
average hotel but it turned out to be a
really unique and cool experience so if
you come to Key West definitely check
out the palms looks like we're just
about packed and ready you ready to sit
in here and just because II for what is
it
Leah got weird were passing through I
guess it's called over to highway route
1 the southernmost highway in the
continental US over what seems to be
like on the map it looks like just water
but wetland marshy areas super super
cool yet when we came in it was
nighttime dull so guys we're on
something called the seven mile bridge
seven miles
it's me Gus in this little bridge means
that we are officially out of the keys
it's not a set what a good time perfect
first stop
more gas I don't even know how much
we've spent on gas of her you probably
use a lot of it and I'm in here sitting
against the window and all the sudden
just fall asleep
they messed again it's tired I don't
want to sit look here in Ohio we have a
function like these things you can let
go but I believe it's like in the state
of Florida you can't you have to hold it
that way you can't leave your pump
unattended
Disneyworld right over there
Magic Kingdom
listen it's like 94 degrees outside or
does anyone travel and do that out the
window
favorite day
I know it's so dumb
we're like by Orlando Tampa it's like 95
feels fantastic
you tell us yeah
and then we're making the haul we're
doing the long haul to Atlanta I
consider it like stopping somewhere
between and driving a little bit in the
morning but yeah we're not doing that
we're going all the way to ATL it's up
for certain we fell a windy sign for
this service station service area
there's no Wendy's in there apparently
it's like over here somewhere
I want some good old-fashioned windy and
cheeseburger
Scottie
there we go that's what I'm talking
about
this place is stacked
who knew there was more than just a cast
station here we got options
KFC nature's table Wendy's that's my jam
here we go I know every time we get in
the car and we start driving again here
we have this song from Willie Nelson on
the road again pops in my head every
time no worries I got that I don't know
if I got that delicious Wendy's spicy
chicken all right I'm ready for another
couple hours guys doing good you doing
good Holley we're up to play a game soon

that's our alphabet I'll tell you we
don't
yeah we don't have that same so confused
that does not make sense is the same as
you say aluminum aluminum

the differences are concrete they'll
never be changed so it's just something
that we have to deal with this is how we
pass time
sepra
zebra just like it come here lady let me
take off simra we do put it together
order knows where this zero point family
is
basically was it referencing
that's what people to watch is what it
is just like just like you can
rightfully change the letter Z to Zed I
think you taste different to see not
true you see guys traveling in the car
with other with people from other
cultures is a learning experience the
whole time the whole trip is a learning
experience
yeah it is always a bit open I've
learned just fried from the song like no
but seriously look look at all this
traffic
we're stuck in traffic
I hope they're okay
hey that's trying to scare you you can
hear my flip-flops stop it
so where to rest up trying to get into
some trouble yeah we shouldn't mess
around since there's armed security on
it was we wait I tried but I couldn't
squeeze one foot yeah no use hours later

state
Scottie

got fans together go centers on the
troubleshoot

someone's gonna go through the trouble
to plug Ghost Hunters on their vehicle
they've done it before yeah look we had
to stop for gas and I did I looked up
the ghost hunters thing that was on the
back of that vehicle the guy that was in
the passenger seat was totally the dude
