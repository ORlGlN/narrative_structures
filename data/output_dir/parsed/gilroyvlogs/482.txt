hear all right bye
well friends it's early in the morning
you know I done came home last night
sat right on the couch and then I was
out it was over so well in the vlog now
but I just want to say real quick before
I do last night when we were at the
arcade Colin that there was a little
girl there who offered to play the crane
game for the boys to get for Colin to
get a ball and she she got him a ball
plus a little tiny ball above this bowl
and he spent the rest of his card on
getting her a ball that was that last
clip there where he entered the the big
bouncy ball and I just thought that was
so cool you know to see that kind of
thoughtfulness in him and you know such
a little kid well that just makes you
feel good as a parent that tells you
that you've done the right thing you
know you should be proud of the way your
kids are being raised because he truly
kept playing that game until he could
win her that ball I just think that was
so cool
so big big thumbs up for Colin and being
very very thoughtful and generous and
giving so yeah that's what I'm gonna
leave you guys today today is actually a
very busy busy exciting day well it's
exciting for the kids we have a train
Expo we're taking them to up in Columbus
they've gone to it the past couple years
and they really really love it so yeah
