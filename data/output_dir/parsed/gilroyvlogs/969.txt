which is super cool brought his favorite
restaurant and a letter and I don't know
if I'm supposed to read this on the vlog
not but Tamra really cool letter
but at the end I thought was really
funny since by the way get a damn dog
another rules that forbid by having a
dog a young age changed my life
I know Tim I know we're working on it
yeah hi to be honest I don't I don't
think I've ever said it before but I
used to have a dog a golden retriever
yeah and her name was knowledge she was
my dog from when she was a puppy and
loved her dearly she was my favorite
she's my best friend my man's best
friend and she she eventually got really
sick and we had to put her down so after
that I've never really had any interest
in getting another dog
because
the emotional attachment
I just didn't I didn't want to go
through losing a dog again because their
lives aren't as long as ours so
but we will get a dog I'm sure the boys
really want a dog daddy and a cat
these are four heads you guys ever had
warheads I'm telling you what I'll let
you have one okay no no no are you sure
what all right Eve sent us a cool little
drone it's like a gladiator helmet
please put this in the vlog I love your
vids and do the warhead challenge the
word job I'm supposing I guess that's to
put all these warheads in your mouth at
the same time at it
I can totally do that my my mouth is
actually watering right now thinking
about it like this he warned us think
about something try this experiment
think about something you know that it's
extremely sour like Moorhead
if you think about putting it in your
mouth your mouth and water

van they are flying out to LA for VidCon
Tally's upstairs packing Romans passion
Veronica is going to hang out Lindsay

this is actually the saddest part of my
day I could say goodbye to everyone you
think in my neck pillow that's hot
just make sure you wipe your neck off on

guess personal preference really it's
such an appropriate shirt for today in
appropriate appropriate appropriate very
appropriate all right guys have fun at
VidCon daddies master Fisher
I would behind me
yeah vibrating TV yeah it's my life to
the airport tell me to forget
I think it's perfect yeah you want to
take a picture of us course what are you
doing Sam
getting my treatment done Sam we haven't
really talked about this ever
that was Samantha Josh's wife remember
Samantha has a condition called
myasthenia gravis and it's a very rare
condition and from what I understand
correct me if I'm wrong but her immune
system attacks her involuntary muscle
your voluntary muscles you muscles ever
voluntary so sometimes when it first
happened Samantha's eyes started to go
different directions right so normally
Samantha Samantha up until what how long
was it how long has this been lucky here
about two years so two years ago she
started having these adverse reactions
like her eyes would start to go cross it
was really weird and so she had to have
a bunch of tests done and they figured
out everything so now she has a home
health nurse that comes and gives her
these treatments it's it's pretty insane
with IVs on a weekly basis sometimes she
gets real tired
you can't like be very active can't
control her muscles now you can't get
back up yeah but what's most incredible
all is samantha is one of the most
positive and optimistic people that you
could ever meet
she doesn't say oh I have this condition
no one knows what it is feel bad for me
samantha is just enjoying her life she's
not and this is why I love you dearly
it's awesome so no matter what your
ailment the point of my story here is no
matter what your condition or ailment
things could always be worse you can be
dead so while you have the opportunity
to live and be well do that I'm gonna do
a little target practice practice the
aim a little bit you know what I mean
cuz I need to improve that Josh has his
little rifle well it's a big rifle a
little ripe this is the - 2017 no
carbine nine-millimeter that one's fun
that's I think this guns a lot funner to
shoot because it has the red dot sight
definitely what look at what here yeah
why do you have your kids around guns
guns guns guns well we want the kids to
be aware of guns and no gun safety of
some kids I know these days teenagers
they don't they've never held a gun
never seen a gun in person except for
not on movies and mapa I think awareness
of guns is important but it's low the
left I need to move to the right oh so I
put a paper target on this board down
here and I'm trying to try to figure out
my typical aim I remember someone
commenting before I said something like
your dominant eye I'm pretty sure I'm
shooting it with my dominant eye but I'm
pretty off all these ones down here and
sucks
see we got that's better that's better I
want to say bye to you I'll see you
later dude
hop on we are back home Veronica is in
her favorite spot to watch a movie we're
gonna watch a movie it's just her and I
we're gonna do like we used to do when
we very first met I used to drive 45
minutes away just to come and hang out
with Veronica she lived like three
cities away we're gonna watch get him to
the Greek very funny movie Russell Brand
is Jonah Hill P Diddy cat stroke the
furry wall you know that's all you do
