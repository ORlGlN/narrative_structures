what's happening guys welcome to uh
welcome to our day you remember the past
couple days there was a couple days ago
I said something about the dogs and then
climbing up on the counters and all that
stuff well today I'm gonna catch him in
the act we set something up on the
counter whether its food or whatever the
dogs will even go for something as
simple as a loaf of bread they won't get
on the counters or into the trash or
anything if they know we're here in the
house so we're going to set up the
camera and we're gonna disappear out in
the office and watch them on the baby
monitor okay what do you want Liza
okay you want bicycle that's it cool and
really I just want to be sure like which
of the dogs is the one climbing up on
the counter I have a suspicion that it's
echo and angels been getting blamed a
lot for it but I think it's honest so
you check Oh we'll find out that's what
this experiment is all about all right
angel neck oh you girls be good whatever
you do don't get up on the counter and
eat any of those goodies
I cannot believe it
we put out of the house for literally
she got right up there didn't she look
look at them they are just going right
to work like that's what they should be
doing down I can talk to him through
this thing but let's see a bigger dick
echo I don't know what are you doing you
guys failed the test where you add echo
echo that's a bad dog
I'm disappointed in you girls I guess I
kind of knew it was gonna be both of
them but man what really blows my mind
is that they literally went straight to
it as soon as we walked out now the
question is how do we fix that clearly
you don't want to leave things on the
counter for them to get to but how do we
train them to never get on the counter
or into the trash period that is the
question
all right we have guests they came to
bring us early Christmas presents do not
attack
now be fun just we're about play some
games huh nah Polly who doesn't love
monopoly saw grandpa jack and Marsha
which is Jay's I got Jays parents on
Veronica's mom uh her family's so
confusing did I really just say that
oh yeah they came over real quick to
bring some presents for the kids because
they are going out of town this weekend
and uh who am I talking to no we have
enlisted the help of mom all right did
my mom say hi to her and say hi my mom
hi
there's my mom so mom I was going to
watch the kids while drunk and I go on a
date are you ready which is luck are you
ready for our date daddy yeah we're just
going to have fun cuz girls just want to
have fun hmm
what you got there so dinner for
everyone a good Zagat salad for Mama her
like we don't have time to cook we don't
have time to do anything we got to
literally get out there and bust it
it's not a date night that was just a
ruse we actually have some serious
holiday work to do okay look look you
guys I hear you right so
I'm driving and still the cameras being
held where your hands bro
look we picked up old Caleb is why
Caleb's frog guns
Christmas work to do too
we figured instead of going to like our
normal local spot
squats
take a little trip in our favorite
rocket ship up to East but if you
haven't heard of Easton before Easton
and Columbus is like it's like an
outdoor
mall type I don't know there's fillings
and I really fancy stores that they're
like glue
Nordstrom
raises
we go on any of them stairs oh my gosh
this place is so massive you can't even
fit it all in the frame look at this
Veronica you look so small from up down
here this is you I'll get you a house
like this one honey I promise okay
get me a health like birthday woman's
even still to when we get a house like
this we're gonna have stuff like that up
there oh honey I've always wanted some
deer urine oh that smells fantastic
you could get all season you're in it's
1,600 bucks you want it you can probably
imagine who we're in here looking for
stuff for all the field and stream has
their own dicks when you're doing the
last night of shopping and there's only
one particular guy in the family who
really enjoys this kind of outdoor stuff
now this is just blowing my mind right
now
take a bobber like you used to have
right you put it on your line and then
you've got sonar on your phone what
application ain't what it used to be
dude it has a camera oh yeah
is so cool
all the music the sounds of the holiday
we just finished in field and stream
I can't show you the back cuz we can't
give away what we're doing right now but
I think it's pretty clear
we're supposed to fight
like five times
there you go
don't
let's take
we love our pets just as much as the
kids and so they should have something
nice to write well let container store
right there I've never been in The
Container Store I'm all about
organization let's check to see that
secondhand store
we are totally testing out like steps
tools to get the kids to start showering
and getting ready in their bathroom and
why though because they can't see
themselves in their own mirror so that
yeah the mirror in their bathroom is too
short so we need a step stool like this
holding one yeah for super strong Rhino
full trying to test that durability
alright see it's a rhino stone it seems
to be working yeah oh look at that
that's what I need
it's picking it up too all you do yeah
we used to have those of Pizza condoms
are used to wear the watch stream like
oh hey that is disgusting come get this
stool you just before we get any farther
into this evening we need some food we
chose a place called the melt this place
is seriously awesome if you've ever
wanted to have like the most incredible
grilled cheese sandwiches you've ever
tasted
Oh Caleb orders mac and cheese bites
are you what's awesome pretty good
deep-fried pocket or
a big best scoop of macaroni and cheese
how do they do it can you believe that's
all this left of our meals
you know those sandwiches are huge I'm
kidding
we had to take them to go how we go on
we're totally like oh we got what more
like
we're like we're full work we're fault
no seriously though those sandwiches are
huge they only got you got a hole I got
a hole I got a half and I half of a half
all right we moved on to like candle
smelling and stuff candles and stuff
look there's awesome eucalyptus mint for
your stress relief right
mango dragon fruit for that fruity aura
in your home it's winter and you miss
the beach so check out some Honolulu Sun
smells just like the ocean or if if
you're one of those people who love to
smoke cigarettes you could always just
have a tobacco flower candle like who
makes it tobacco smelly candle you want
to go on it look how psycho
that is though no I know I'm liking this
look out
look how Christmassy this whole spot is
don't mind my my foggy windshield but
look how beautiful this Eastern town
center is right now
something there's a there's an actual
Tesla store here in Easton and we pulled
him she's like what's Tesla it's like
it's a car company and we just passed it
the car in your life how didn't who was
in action everybody is a guard
it's a electric car company
make me motion sick for real it's all
right it's just a I know it's just a
moving moving sidewalk you'll be fine
list over did you find anything I did
not find it no dull I'm seriously
looking straight up for a legit
Christmas onesie I want the pouf would
be Christmas ones he ever
this process we lost Caleb

Veronica's in there finishing off the
last of our our shopping trip it's like
10 till close this place closes at 10
by myself super curious like who's been
camping right up there in the rafters
but check out those shoes like they're
back and they're like him I got shoes
back when I was like 10 I remember no I
remember you having them I just remember
this my sister and my step-brother all
have the same shoes no yeah I said it to
a sister well I don't know if we've seen
it
mom or thanks for staying with the kids
well we got some super crucial stuff
done I hope so cuz I you know I'm past
my bedtime
you need a massage no I need a bid no we
can help you with that I'm one bit I was
gonna refer Caleb for the massage
one of the only downsides I guess in
this pellet stove is that if you leave
it and it runs out you don't have any
heat but the nice thing is obviously you
got a nice hot fire when it is gone and
I mean what do you think we should just
enjoy this I've always dreamed of having
like a nice romantic night right honey
in front of a fireplace with some bubbly
in milady
hmm of course that's not tonight because
we have stuff to do and unfortunately

it for today because well this part of
the evening has to be low-key super
low-key sup I hope you guys are having a
fantastic time the kids are actually off

rest of the year
