before we leave for the day I want to
point one thing out to guys it's really
been puzzling me why does do-not-disturb
translate to no more lest first thing in
the morning you only mean one thing I
need coffee the coffee roll was
exquisite by the way I think I want the
manager's special no apple fritter yeah
apple fritter large coffee sweet and
baby Tong remember baby Tong the coffee
is super super hot so I have to get a
little bit of ice yesterday I got coffee
in the day before
I said give me some ice so it was the
same girl working today I said hey let
me get that same thing I got yesterday
and she's not cool this other girl made
it he hands me my cup of coffee and I
shake it cuz I feel like ice in it and
there's like icing it lots of it I was
like I
wanna complain but this is cold more hot
coffee didn't order iced coffee she goes
well I only put 1/4 cup ice like what
quarter cup for real no no no you just
feel like couple ice cubes a couple of
the weather today is definitely not as
nice as it has been just quite quite
rainy so we have to determine if the
homeowner actually wants us to wash his
windows in the rain which will suck and
if if we do do the house and I can't
take my camera with me that's for sure
now we're back to hotel because Timmy's
drenched and we're trying to decide we
can't work the rest today there's some
huge storms coming we're trying to
decide whether we stay here for the
night or go back home for a little bit
see our wives and children driving cool
Veronica has to work today and so she's
probably gonna be sleeping we decided to
not sit in a hotel
because it's raining and go back go back
to good old come on boss
I texted Roman and told him that I was
coming home and he says yeah apparently

pretty good though mmm so we've been
waiting for Tom to get in has been
taking his sweet time
but finally he's reached a final
destination and we're gonna have to go
meet up and do something fun because we
can't film enough too late when it's
raining and it's raining again because
we live in Ohio do you love your state I

whatnot but
I'm just basically here for support you

get one of those and grind it up and put
it into something of Tom's habanero is
so much hotter yeah he'll know when he
gets a taste of some habanero you know
what you might kill tom he's like a
hundred and eighty years old
