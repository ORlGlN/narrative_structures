everyone's talking about how the iPhone
six when you put it in your pocket it
bends so I just got a brand new one and
I'm gonna put it through the ultimate
test and explode it the iPhone is stuck
right in between help of bricks and I
have some Tanner right here if you don't
know what that is we've shot it before
and it's basically an explosive target
so we're gonna see if this explosion
causing any damage to this iPhone and
here's our arms expert set with the two
what is this no idea it's Russian
something or other I've never shot
before in my life well great because we
all know I'm horrible aim whenever
you're ready bow where is the phone
oh dude look at this look at this look
at this look at this
where's the phone where's the phone oh
my god where is the phone yo you're
kidding me did it survive I don't want
to look I don't want to know
well I don't see any scratches
she's certainly not been perfectly good
iphone super durable even an explosion
can't bend this phone what do you have
to say now
