you like there you go you got a cotton
swab there really Thank You Bobby you're
welcome
I I'm pretty sure your your viewers will
appreciate what we just did because I
know - preciate what we did I hate that
sometimes you're out filming and a windy
location and something really awesome
happens and the wind kicks in and then
all of a sudden your clip sucks because
you know I have a windscreen on camera
yeah so now you do thank you high-five
did we get we get it done I have one
more big question to ask you Seth um
what's your plans tomorrow night
alright well I anticipated at least at
least one number - really
but other than that I need you for a
number seven I could do a seven number
seven the number seven is film op I need
you to run camera for me tomorrow for
this murder mystery speakeasy awesome
thing that we're doing I need a
cameraman are you in I don't care what I
got going on up top it really dropped my
phone is going off like a a lot alright
so we got our work done for the day
the vlog is now uploading shouldn't be
up shortly I sent the kids outside so I
could have some peace and quiet Veronica
took maybe Eliza she's hunting for her
outfit for tomorrow
and yeah we're gonna go play in the
water oh no we need to go check the mail
mail wait I need to go get the stuff for
my outfit whoa we got some stuff to do
we got some stuff to do this is what
Veronica's grandma gave her you can see
right through it
it smells like 1920s apparently this is
100% authentic from 1920 no joke
her grandma said this is from 1920 so so
there's that and Colin just came in and
says dad help me what you do well
unfortunately I don't have a key dude
we're going this way
what are we gonna do now I really don't
have a key one of these things is gonna
work paper clip or a bobby pin now
you'll learn your lesson boys don't put
handcuffs on anyone or anything until
you physically have the key okay got it
okay you just take the paperclip right
and you put it in the hole and you point
it up towards this part there's just a
little lever that you have to press up
on boom just like that in case the cops
ever get you you gotta get out so I'm
not entirely certain that t.j.maxx was
around in the 1920s I'm gonna
safely say it wasn't but I'm pretty sure
that I can find the essentials that I
need for my outfit at t.j.maxx what do
you think Colin yeah yeah I just got a
call from Veronica and apparently the
girls aren't having very much luck all
right so I found my bowtie and I got to
Chad needs one so I'm gonna hook him up
and the only other things I needed
suspenders and like a white like a white
dress shirt I'm like well something like
that two of the three pieces I needed
boom just like that one stop I I was
told to go to Goodwill
to find the other suspenders
come on brother let's go I guess where
we are

pretty long check this out look at the
color difference between my grass and
this grass I don't know if you can tell

is great and all the dandelions are dead
