Veronica's mom said on my right home she
fix the lasagna there's plenty for
everyone don't worry about doing dinner
you can have lasagna when we had lasagna
her cousin Amber's house Amber was the
first person ever to have put pepperonis
in her lasagna I don't eat many other
people's lasagna except for my mom and
my grandpa when they make it but
Veronica's mom's lasagna boom a
pepperoni it's fair to say that there's
probably more pepper in there what is it
with you guys you put me temporalities
in lasagna you don't ever put it in our
lasagna because I never think about it
when I go to the store to get this stuff
but really but you're telling me growing
up you've always had pepperoni on
I've never heard whatever I like it
taste it I mean I'll accept it because
it's food and I like pepperonis and I
like lasagna and wine up up have a
reason I was out here together but some
of people out there would say why us
arrogant Americans would ruin their time
dish alright so we've had some food
we've had some down time I gotta come up
here to my my bedroom / office I need to
fireball my gear I have a friend an
online buddy who's helping me figure out
some of my streaming settings and make
sure everything is good and if all is
