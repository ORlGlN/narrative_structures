what's up guys welcome to our beautiful
adventure day we are going to the
Columbus Zoo everyone's here that was
pretty quick everyone cheer I think
another good coming again I want six of
them birds in my mouth
crunchy and delicious thank you that's
right it's time to eat I don't know if
you guys have ever been to King's
raising a caves chickens
we went there once before in the blog I
just want to show you oh they make this
stuff like freshmen you order it it's
not pre-made and it's always super super
super hot
we're gonna eat in the parking lot while
we wait for mom and dad to get there
here's a little piece of info from my
past
this is Seoul Mill Road right and right
back there probably a block is where I
used to drive to work every single day
this is that auto auto sales place that
I did the maybe the Flyers for it sucked
it sucked having to drive 45 minutes all
the way up here every single day there
zoombies ebay over there that place
huh are you sure here's the bad part
about coming on such a beautiful day
look at the amount of vehicles here oh
let's place a hat
but I don't that one
I'm hopeful we'll find something as soon
as I hit the record button right in
front of me with this spot right against
the road perfect it's kind of a long
walk up there but so what at least we
don't have to go all the way up there
you ready to go in here man hey there's
grandma grandpa it's gonna be fun your
first zoo experience Liza yeah you ready
hey mama really that's funny we're
getting a membership too yeah we
realized that with the cost of admission
here for all of us to get in if we spent
like 30 bucks more we could get a
membership which covers us for a whole
year so if we come twice that pretty
much the rest of the visits are paid for
good good we want to get a membership
oh we're in we're members now remember
it's a part of a club okay okay you want
to go pet some animals yeah there's like
goats and stuff in here
it's picture time watch I guarantee
every one of these little brass bronze
sculptures we run across they're gonna
have to take a picture on it it's kind
of like tradition come on dude can you
get down
watch those horns buddy
we just had someone stopping us to take
a picture I didn't catch your name but
thank you for stopping that was awesome
we're trying to create catch the Grizz
oh my gosh look at that guy let's see
him from this window look he must have
tried to get out they had to board it up
yeah it's too hot
he's like to heck with this too huh
you're about to go to Africa I've always
wanted to go to Africa always I know
i drape the baby hydrate the baby bureau
poor thing
we need a air-conditioned stroller so
when you send back that I was gonna get
a wet washcloth and put it in the cooler
so I could take it out that's a great
idea but I didn't bring it here I'll
take my sock off and we can use my truck
hey in a survival situation you gotta do
what you gotta do all right let's go I
think I think I'm gonna have to show
these girls up I think it's marvelous
we found this wonderful oasis in this
desert
yeah get some
were you one of those for the backyard
cool pushing the button to make the
speaker sound like the engine starting I
don't think that planes gonna start guys
yeah sure is bottle break hey let's go
see these monkeys while Liza's in there
right here monkey looking
now
so it looks like poor Carson couldn't
handle walkin anymore your feet okay
buddy you won't fall off
look let me put this place in
perspective back that way was Africa we
want to go see the monkeys and the
gorillas and all that stuff a day our
way over there across the road you have
to go like underneath the road so it's
pretty much almost from one end of the
park to the other to get from one Africa
to the African forest which is where
we're going and I gotta carry this
monkey on my back give me the best give
me your best monkey impression Carson
really
we just had that moment where we all
took a big break as a group and sat in
the shade and had some drinks and relax
as soon as we get up to go over to the
next spot colin goes I gotta poop you
before we catch up with them at the
African forest me and call are gonna
check out the manatee coat
that's pretty cool right you know you
can swim with manatees doing it you can
actually swim with them and they'll let
you yeah yeah when we go to Florida
we'll find the spot where we can swim
with manatees that'd be so awesome
we'll say we keep this underwater sea
life theme going and go to the aquarium
and then we're gonna go to the reptile
that's the first time you ever seen a
turtle fight huh yeah it looks like we
found mommy and Carson there Liza we've
made it this is the coolest part of the
zoo in my opinion I love the monkey the
silverback gorillas chimpanzees
chimpanzee get this gorillas got you
it's time for a photo shoot
my father
Oh
I take the best photos
we have to come on this the rest of time
this is where all the kids throw their
poo and puke in their hands and eat it
take a picture with them he can't hurt
you
folk tap on the glass
he said what is this the average what
are these people doing in front of the
glass what is this cabbage
here's my take on these animals here
although it's really cute and cool
here it's kind of sad in a way
these are wild animals that belong in
the wild
they lived their lives inside these
cages
where is he where's the baby
let's go find it I missed it
well we've exhausted the entire blog
cameras battery and this is the end of
pretty much our zoo visit these monkey I
wish I had more battery to zoom in and
show you guys more about the GoPro
obviously can zoom in so
we'll see you guys back at the car again
who finally made it back to the Jeep it
was a hot one I wish we had enough
camera battery left to show you guys how
miserable they were on their way back it
was pretty
but let's go
you guys are lucky going to bed yeah
wish I could go to bed what just
collapse right here just fall asleep
right here on the floor oh I feel so
much better
what'd you do to me did you knock me out
last night or something no we had so
much fun yeah and we are going to fix
that today today is the day of a massive
shift what baby's having a diaper change
Veronica and I are going to start
working out together she started working
out already
but it's time for me to join the
bandwagon it's gonna happen so today
this morning mom walls come in to watch
the kids well me and Veronica go
together to work out we'll make then
tomorrow's video because today's already
quite long and I've got a lot of footage
to sift through which you see already
the zoo is so much fun yesterday we had
a lot of fun we didn't get to see a
whole lot because we had to make some
stops and I don't know it was just
having kids makes it harder to get
through the whole zoo
yeah what's it what it definitely was
super super fun so with that being said
I have to dump all the footage and get
this camera charged a little bit we're
going to the gym yeah that's all I've
got for you guys today look forward to
tomorrow's video where you seen its
positive changes and thumbs up for
fitness vlogs thank you guys so much for
watching I can't wait to see all of you
