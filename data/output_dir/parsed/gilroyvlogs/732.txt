right here check this out
check this out we got the eggs with the
hots out baby yeah I'm getting this solo
shot deal all charged up we're going to
take her out before I film anything I'm
gonna there's a quite a process to
actually getting this thing set up
so we'll vlog about that part and then
I'll save the actual you know tutorial
part for the review look at this
beautiful day you're not going to
believe this it's like 70 degrees feels
fantastic I'm gonna hit up this car wash
clean out my car and just soak up some
Sun this is freakin nice they say you
can't polish a turd but you can at least
sweep all the dirt off of it all right
so we're getting everything ready for
this this is just the test I'm gonna
make sure I know how to set this thing
up there's quite a process to be honest
this little white thing is the tag and
it says that it has to you turn it on
and you have to leave it on the ground
face up for at least eight minutes it's
got to warm up then you can get the
tripod base and all that setup which we
got going on and then we can move on but
have to wait for that thing to warm up
it definitely follows you and I think
that's so awesome you can see Scott
taking it to the left and right and then
watch the finger lift
that's pretty cool dude he's ready Scott
had to do an oil change on the quad just
for this video you know walk you're
gonna rip ass on it that's why this
thing is so cool man we just finished
filming the review Scotty was the guy
riding the bike but there at the end I
took a little stroll and it's awesome
