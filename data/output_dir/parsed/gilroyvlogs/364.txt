hey over here
look here no me no me of that we're so
in the middle of a road trip right it
can be quite boring and like it's always
good to keep your mind busy so you don't
like lose yourself go crazy so we've
come up with a couple of games we want
to show you guys and feel free to look
around you know this is a 360 video
check out the interior of the cheap
James over there Holly in the back I
want to show you guys a couple of road
games to keep your mind occupied during
the road trip so the first game we want
to show you is
the license plate game here's how this
works
you're driving along the highway of
course there's nothing but cars take a
look at a license plate and you want to
look at the first three letters on that
license plate so in this case it's G H a
so then I would try and come up with a
phrase three words starting with G H a
of
it's harder than you first think it is
about
GHA
grandma has
bread do we have to do the same letters
not reject enough you have to have a
different guy you have to have a
different car you have to speed up
safety first I'm going the speed limit
just in case anyone wonder if you can
see see my hands see my hands are on the
correct position of steering wheel 10 to
more like a 11 of one yeah
all right
summer play needed
if the trucks don't work the trucks
really allows it very different from
mine back at home our there's on Friday

number two that's the license plate game
very fun you guys can come up with
anything
keep it clean you can make it Holger
it's up to you I'm not - keep it PG gap
it is tried - I tried - I snuck a little
one in there okay so the next game you
could play is called slug bug and this
is a game that we used to play a lot
when we did road trips my family used to
go from Ohio to Florida all the time so
we had a long trip in the car so slug
bug is basically you're looking for a VW
beetle or the bugs you know the bug not
as common now as they used to be so that
game might be a little more tricky but
basically it goes like you need to look
out for a slug bug
as the driver of course you want to use
extreme caution should you see a
Bob
you're gonna go slug bug orange hit the
torch and then you got to wipe it off or
else they can hit you back alright you
have to say the color yes slug bug
the color and wacom that'll keep you
awake too
so what do we do if we don't see one
then I just hate you anyway nobody spy
yellow car really sir yellow yellow
lorry yellow car get a mini yellows hora
means truck right yeah okay just to be
clear not a lolly lorry
I can't really see any slug bugs but in
the middle of the rest of this video if
any of us see a slug bug it's on four
yellow or yellow or yellow that's fine
I think the same holds definitely apply
for them the third game you can play in
the car and this one is a real classic
called I spy so how'd you play that game
right
well James I'll tell you so basically
you're gonna say I spy with my little
eye green just say I spy
the kids re-elected I spy with my little
eye and we'll do something inside the
Jeep
y'all alright see you guys James found

Jeep and will only pick out things
inside the Jeep and we have to try and

you okay my life
something
would it be this blue
the Doritos don't mind could they even
see that I wonder if you guys could even
see that okay they could thank you for
do you see this you see so even
something as simple as like trying to
pick out something inside your vehicle
or outside which might be even harder
because before you know it you're
already past it but just something to
pass the time to keep your mind busy
while you're on a road trip I can tell
you from experience 15 plus hours in a
car will kind of make you go a little
nuts yeah so it's nice to keep your mind
busy playing little games like this with
your friends or your family so
