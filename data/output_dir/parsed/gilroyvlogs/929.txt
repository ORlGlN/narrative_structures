all right good morning gladiators I got
I'm gonna tell you a little story last
night we were filming a video and we
came up with this idea that just
inspired by Mike blew all of our minds
because Mike's
Mike's idea Eric's idea Dennis's idea
yeah I don't like it looks like you're a
banana so you know the Ebola virus is in
town it's in the u.s. came from South
Africa and two of the people affected by
the Ebola virus are now in Atlanta but
we thought it would be an interesting
idea to see how people would react to
someone walking around and I guess over
like a baby
Aaron do well as we're pulling in the
federal courthouse is less than a block
away and it is literally lined with
homeland security SUVs and heavily
armored police personnel outside the
building something and they might give
us some sort of reaction that is might
be
Dennis Roady biologically secured I'm
hoping this video goes as good as I
think it is I think you pulled up pretty
freaked out
yeah I should be there's a bowler in
America yeah on the other hand they
could just be like what it's got a
painting for it I think I might freak
out there walking around near the
Federal Building with all that chef is
like Homeland Security we're gonna be
like what are you doing hey at the first
sign of police activity after I can quit
Roland I'm gonna be running dennis has
had massive amounts of police activity
yeah Homeland Security all on his ass
yeah and a Taser pointed at it the guy
literally goes I don't wanna get these
20 right at my chest yeah I didn't want
to get tasered in the heart if you like
point is I'm nervous
we're about halfway through filming this
video and it's coming together a lot
better than I thought it would part two
of this video is gonna be doubles so
Mike and Dennis are gonna be together
wearing the suits and you know just how
we spice it up so the ante getting more
crazy you've already got a cop's all my
security now we're gonna get double oh
yeah
they're just gonna be like a gay rights
ruling for equality marriage but there's
tons
that's why Homeland Security was okay
first time they've seen sweat on my
forehead
did you sweat man you sweat like no
other person I've ever seen mouth this
time this time I'm not this time not
even coming out this time it's not
because of laxatives yeah put your hands
up like this no up
I thought water before these suits are
sweating so bad in these suits feel so
bad for you alright pretty much I just
need a solid intro that's a wrap on this
