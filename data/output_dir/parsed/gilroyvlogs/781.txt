look at this thing have you guys ever
seen anything like this this contraption
it's like a baby bee joy
it's Bjorn it's not it's not pizza it's
not delivery its baby bjorn I think I
think even I might be saying it wrong
maybe it's born
I think it's baby beyond I agree so so
you haven't figured this out yet or what
no well I know that these are shoulder
straps right so I'm pretty sure it goes
over the back of you like that
so put your arms in yeah yeah and I'm
assuming this is like a back support
maybe so then you go to buckle it yeah
and then I'm assuming look look look
look look
you see that's blue see that's red yeah
here's blue right here look right here
blue red baby what's the baby
for the baby's pinky toes you put the
baby's pinky toes in there I guess huh
so you're going to wear this at work so
you guys will be excited to know that
Carson feels much better real nasty
weird koftas mine like had a big giant
fur ball stuck in his throat it's
nothing
how's your three girlfriends Zak's here
we're getting ready to go film some epic
hopefully epic longboarding action with
these Garmin VirB camera I'm trying to
really put the scam to the test and it's
got some cool features that I want to
test out like let's see how fast
zach can go down this hill in miles per
hour look how we can see through the
crack in your windshield this is our
hill guys you can really tell how steep
it is but it looks weak it's pretty dope
it's a nice nice hill
this is topper here mm-hmm okay yeah do
you yeah I want to I want to scout some
spots basically what I'm gonna do is
we've only got Zach Zach's the only
longboarder I'm no good at this crap
he's the expert
so basically what we're gonna do is use
the Garmin camera to capture as many
different angles as we can so poor zach
is gonna have to actually bomb this hill
quite a few times holding the camera
with camera mounted on board camera
position on side street i actually
thought of a shot where we would put the
camera suction cup to the trunk and then
i'll drive down the hill and he'll
follow me right behind the camera so
basically it would be like a hands-free
up close POV okay the cool thing about
this this particular shoot and why I'm
using that camera is because the camera
allows you to overlay for it for this
particular application speed so I can I
can calculate how fast he's going
because the camera reads how fast he's
going in miles per hour which is pretty
awesome so you get to see how fast you
go down this hill
thinking about 30 maybe 30 that's it max
we'll see we'll see we'll see
all right on top of the hill you're
gonna get taken off we're gonna send him
down the hill first with like pole we're
just gonna have him hand hold the camera
do a run all the way down the hill
capture a couple of different angles
yeah
first one's easy
this is how we bring him back up the
hill push push boy push so I've sent
Zach down the hill quite a few times
already and now we're gonna get like
some stationary flyby shots someone like
put the camera pretty much right here in
the road and he's gonna just swoop right
past it right in front of the lens
it's so fast than that man
this is good times man we need like we
need seven or eight other dudes get a
whole buncha guys out here bored look at
this angle
don't worry we're being completely safe
on the street that doesn't have very
much traffic at all how you feel are you
cold or what no no hands like brave red
and rocks or so dry we're getting ready
to do the one clip that I hope we only
have to do once because it makes me a
little nervous then I think if there I'm
gonna slam on the brakes
a guy skated his heart oh man good for
you young you should be able to do this
kind of stuff now me I mean I probably
could still for sure but I would need a
couple days to recover after
so I think that was definitely a good
accurate test of like I wanna the goal
of this whole shoot was to use that
garment to get the speed overlay I want
to see how that works and then use it to
make a video or a video segment you did
good
Zach nicely done I worked really hard he
did so you can put some cool stuff on
screen watch this watch this watch this
he starts going alright so he's going
downhill he's got speed right here this
outer ring is distance to when he stops
moving over here is like it saved a
piece of the track like the road map and
there is actual distance and numbers
over here I think you actually maxed out
at what 35 miles per hour per day that's
pretty fast get really fast
I'm digging this I like it I like it
fast-forward into the evening mommy
for mommy baby kids are home fluffy but
it's time for bed right you guys don't
have to race tonight we'll take tonight
off Carson are you feeling much better
honey yeah yeah that's good that's good
hey why don't you Tara one good night
Colin it does suck see my kids sick
especially when there's a new baby in
the house and she could possibly get
sick too yeah oh here comes the bus
bye dude have fun I love you love you
Garson all right so with the boys gone
to school Veronica I let her sleep in
for a while
worked on some editing and now she's up
and about how to shower
everyone's feeling funky fresh I'm about
to head out to get my hair cut
you're gonna go to the bank run some
errands and stuff like that so I don't
have anything as far as payback on
Veronica's clever little breast milk
coffee creamer trick but I think I think
I got something really good but you'll
have to wait all right guys this is
where I put the camera down I can't wait
to see you right back here
