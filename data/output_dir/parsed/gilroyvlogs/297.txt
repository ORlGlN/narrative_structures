excited let's get it I now would have
been the time you would see like a
really cool drone shot but there's two
factors working against us that big
ominous darkness over there that could
potentially be rained and my lightning
cable is missing from the Jeep so I
couldn't even fly if I wanted to anyways
Jay and I came to the mall here I need a
