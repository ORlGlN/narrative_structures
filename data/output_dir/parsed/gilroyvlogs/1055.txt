not very warm it's probably like 60
degrees out
we're gonna go capture some footage some
GoPro footage on the beach with the
Jeep's

Dallas is gonna front flip off of this
dude
all right let's see if I can get any
farther
that's not that far to drop
Lindsay wants to jump with Dallas this
is gonna be the funniest thing I've ever
seen in my life she launched aired
Lindsay alright we're trying to go back
to the house that we stayed at the very
first time that we were here

did not look like this before and it
almost looks unpassable we're gonna give
a shot right you're gonna hey don't tip

stayed at shell game nice house

was trying to fly it off this porch and
it's over here over in the trees and

tub don't worry we turned it down to 90
degrees it's not that hot you like it

other two boys are still in the hot tub

dump a big giant bucket of cold water

big giant shot right now yeah big shot
