don't leave you're gonna forget everyone
hey guys hey you're going with bronica
to the store
don't forget the gladiators because
that's not cool and if I may say you'd
look incredibly beautiful today thank
you look at her one second guys great
five seconds all right so one thing I
definitely had to come to the store for
was some triple antibiotic ointment I
did speak with the doctor's office
yesterday evening and he told me to just
put something like neosporin on it three
times a day for three days and if it's
not looking better than to come into the
office on Monday so we're gonna hope for
the best
I also have to get garlic bread we're
having chicken fettuccine alfredo
tonight
Ginger's oven is broken so I'm going to
grow bread and baking it before we go
you know it's just this bourbon we're
going to celebrate with dinner and cake
and ice cream Wow
the vanilla icing and we're going to get
him a pie
it's only appropriate right but I'm
looking around
most hubs of icy anywhere to Manasa so
obviously I'm standing here for probably
at least a good five minutes almost
about me so I just have to go find
three of them work in London Delhi they
keep looking down nothing like no one
needs to be down at the bakery seeing if
she needs any help
just resort to the extra creamy whipped
topping
you don't handful activate halo playing
halo pay battle it is pretty awesome
halos the game that I started playing
when I got an Xbox I got next box
because of the gay halo I loved it so
much I'm trying to get them into it cuz
it really is a fun game
did you have fun at the store sure did
you have as much fun as we had
there as much fun as I had watching them
play even though I'm gonna get out by
myself
this mine again yeah it's so crowded
every store before we leave I want to
show you guys the rules that the boys
made up this morning these are the rules
that they wrote down no fighting no
arguing no yelling no backtalk in yeah
follow the instructions don't forget to
bring anything and the last two are
blank ball is the inspiration behind
those rules Colin why why'd you make
this rule fight or kick oh okay

the sky
what we see the Sun for like ages we've
been stuck in my house I'm so glad to
get out the house we're finally doing
this we're finally doing this when you
have your first child you'll know what
we mean by being you're basically kind
of landlocked for a period of time while
your baby is growing because you can't
take what you can but you feel like you
can't take your baby out into the world
because what if she gets sicker or or
what if she has a meltdown in public and
you'd be embarrassed or for a number of
different reasons why you don't want to
leave the house because your sanctuary
the safety of your old right I mean
seriously
so so yeah for the longest time for the
past few weeks we kind of been stuck
around the house and and I know the
vlogs aren't as exciting as they could
be because we were just uh
I mean we're drained literally you have
a new baby
that requires round-the-clock 24/7 care
and you have to give it to the baby
because she that's your duty as a parent
it's your job and I'm good at my job
