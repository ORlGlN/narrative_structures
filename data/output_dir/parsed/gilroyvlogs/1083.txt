burgers and that is the jam
this snowing like a bee out there that's
not gonna stop me from taking my wife
out on a date Valentine's Day
Valentine's Day doesn't mean that you
have to buy gifts and you have to do all
this crazy stuff spend a crapload of
money it's just a day to let your woman
know that you love her and we don't get
to go out on dates very often so I think
what we're going to do today is just go
out have dinner maybe catch a movie
Veronica's mom's gonna watch kids and
I'm just cool
so we're just going to go out spend some
time together

so we were going to go to Texas
Roadhouse because that's Veronica's
favorite
down halfway
and then second second-in-line was
mostly Applebee's sour sour weight and I
know I'm 200 away an hour I'm too hungry
no I wouldn't wait an hour for almost
anything so we settled on Max and Herman
they don't come here now we don't come
here ever I don't think I've only been
here one time I feel like today is the
perfect occasion to tell
how we met Veronica used to work at a
joint called the pizza cutter she was
served
and this was when I was in high school
so I used to go there all the time
and I would see her there dating this
other guy a real creep
I'd always had a crush on her and I
always wanted to talk to her but she
always had a boyfriend which sucked for
me so fast-forward like four or five
years later I was living with my buddy
Scott and his girlfriend Lindsay was
good friends with Veronica's Frontera
mutual friends
and one day me and Scott we're hanging
out
Veronica came over
and this was the first time that I had
seen her since pizza cottage
and I just was like as soon as she
walked through that door
I was like I remember you
so we something inside me it's like no
you couldn't really put it together it
was retrieved
I secretly grabbed herself put my number
and rubric
I just put chase but she found it
you called me a new actor you came over
me or you a text
I thought something came up on my phone
outside and then I back
well I remember I put my phone number in
your phone
at some point later like I didn't tell
you I just put it in didn't even sing
and then at some point later you ended
up with your number my
so that's how we met oh my gosh look at
this
steak with asparagus tortilla soup
I can't wait oh yeah we gotta have the a
wound
thanks Alex you're alright I don't care
what Chad says about you I'm just
kidding Chad she loved your turn come on
you can do better than that get it go go
it's good out here it's so cold so after
dinner we came to Cole to check some
stuff out and wouldn't you know it's so
awesome to have a girl who just tried on
chucks you know your girl is badass if
she wants to wear a Chuck everyone's
gonna have a good pair of chucks I think
pretty much anyone would agree you know
it stinks about that statement is I
don't have a pair of chucks filmy brawl
shelter yeah why not I think that's
something that everyone can relate to
these dudes have girlfriends and girls
wear bras sometimes those dudes take off
those brawls all right
I think you should get some of these on
there what do you think you're never too
old for that so my cousin Sonny lives in
Lancaster and we came to Lancaster for
dinner so why not go and see her
right
I miss something I miss her too we don't
get to see everyone as often as we'd
like to we used to live like two doors
down from Hearns you know all the time
so I'm done see if this works the
quarter and the magnet are supposed to
pop off the lid all right you know what
I think this video was designed to make
people like me try to sit here and try
and record themselves talking the lid
off on the quarter yep well done Bravo
dude you would still in the wrapper huh
yeah well we made it home the roads are
yet they're bad thankfully we have
four-wheel drive so we don't need to
worry about that I literally drove 35
hallways so I think we're going to go
ahead and wrap today up
all right guys happy Valentine's Day to
all you couples out there all the moms
and grandmas having a Valentine's Day to
you too
you
