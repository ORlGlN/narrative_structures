Mikey okay see ya had to go way out of
my
way back to my place to get another
battery because the battery in this
camera is about to die well the original
plan was to go rollerskating but I guess
the family decided that we're gonna go
bowling instead so we find us here you
can't see it blinking lanes it's in
Lancaster Ohio that's where we are let's
do it let's go bowling
can't vlogging here it's too dark I'm
really disappointed that getting I
didn't get to vlog at the bowling alley
because it was it was already dark in
there you couldn't see anything that
night I suck I suck hard at bowling to
look terrible
Dallas tried to do the the where you
spin the ball there's no way I can do
that I have to put three fingers in the
holes
the reason I went bowling without
Veronica is because I haven't got to see
my cousin Michael he's only in town for
a few days and I really wanted to meet
his wife which I didn't get to meet last
night I've never met her before and from
what I suit her from what I hear she's
from London and that's so he met her in
London she's just precious so I'm really
glad that I got to meet her and I didn't
I didn't want to feel like that guy
shoving a camera in her face you know so
it was cool to meet her and hang out so
I'm sorry to vlog that you guys would
love to meet her she's really awesome so
we're going to meet up with Veronica now
because she's all done she's been
working very hard at the smile moves to
make sure that all you guys who order
shirts get your stuff
so we're gonna go meet up with my lovely
wife and Dallas is going to a party
I texted Veronica on my way home to see
what she was doing and she didn't reply
back which means only one thing she's
probably passed out on the couch
watching TV so let's I just got home so
let's see if I'm right
just as I thought my little darling
fast asleep that's gonna be the rest of
my night I need to carry my wife up to
bed like a good husband what do I do
apologize that the today's vlog was a
very wasn't very long and that end I
