Motor City casino hotel is an incredible
spot to stay if you come to Detroit
highly recommend
they've got all the stuff you need right
here in the hotel
food they've got food everywhere this is
the buffet and there's all kinds of
restaurants through here it's a it's
really cool plus if you're the gambling
type you can just walk downstairs to the
lobby hit the casino win a couple
hundred or thousand go back up party
that's your thing get ready for a
mouth-watering visual the food here

hand
I don't know how the rest of me would
get there alright kids welcome to the
Auto Show look at all this refined metal
rubber engines
frame check this out
see the gears
well I get generators on the right it's
a hybrid yes so it's an electric motor
that would be what you call the stator
and it rotates around there and
generates electricity which powers the
drive which turns the wheels modern
engineering beautiful this is the the
underbody the frame suspension and
everything underneath the body of the
Audi q7 e-tron Quattro so we're sitting
here getting all our notes together as
we prepared a few the audi q7 this is
really a cool car it's a good family car
and it's like a SUV meets the
it's a crossover and said T's in a
diesel hybrid so it's part electric part
diesel super-efficient is actually very
light and it just looks not third row
seating so I could put Eliza right in
the back we're in the front
yes you should be close yeah but not
only the car is amazing look at the
lighting system I know this whole place
was just wild dude can you imagine can
you imagine how much money was spent on
all these displays and it's just crazy
like this

little piece on the Audi now we're
moving on to Mercedes you want to see a
car that looks like it was made for the
future check this out

arcane thoughts but check out the inside
is that wild or what look at the QR up
code is license plate

and wipe down all the fingerprints shine

a tedious job man every five seconds
someone's touching your work it looks
good I love it so I told you guys that
the car I was looking forward to seeing
was the Acura NSX it seems to be the hot
car everyone's looking at
