/ oh
if any of you live in Atlanta you need
to go to the grog Street Tunnel and find
the LOA sticker that I stuck on there
you'll see a post on Instagram take

I know this isn't like high production
crappy you know with steak and potatoes
and all that catering trim tuna no
they're not they're off today bro good
so we're here at this this part what's
this card again would you park right on
and they've got the cool ATL Sun and it
really reminds me of like in Philly
where they have the love sign you know
that's at the Atlanta it said that land
you're a Good Samaritan we just came
into the Western well drop a number one
and James found a pouch on the floor
with mmm-hmm rather expensive camera
yep that's pants let me see that whole
thing Panasonic it's at least yeah new
mate limits yeah
anyway expensive camera I know I would
be devastated if I lost my camera
so we're gonna find a reception and give
it to it oh you still it that's what we
want we want some coffee
listen we've been on the road we
traveled many many miles you have no
idea miles we've come so far so we're
all tired we need some coffee coffee and
then we'll get back at it okay good good
good yeah you good look at this
it's so cool it's gonna be awesome
people are gonna start coming to see you
dude they're gonna be like oh my gosh
what is this guy doing
we've already got a couple crowd people
so many people over there I like that
this is like a playground - that's cool
moving big things through the city
look at this spot where you just shot at
there's some awesome fountain it's so
pretty
yeah it's good Holly likes it all I
liked it
there's James alright so we just wrapped
on location - it's coming - I'm 32.5
location 2.5 we're going to location
number 3 Piedmont Park and you can't
just drive we got to do
this is we're with the drummer all right
do it
clearly we're not professional
percussionist and we'll just leave big
drum lining to you okay
either way either way it's fun to try
you know you never know we could have
been the next best thing
mmm location 3 this is a Piedmont Park
it's huge
we've literally have been walking around
this park for the past 30 minutes trying
to find the best spot because we want to
look at the city which is back here have
that in the background for his interview
stuff but it's just so hot and by hot
means overexposed so we don't want to
blast the we don't want to blast the
sensitivity of the camera so that he's
visibly lit but the background is just
way too white so that's what we're
trying to avoid it's like we've been
walking in the desert
everyone's like I'm thirsty yeah Sun
coming down cityscape
you guys it's a disaster
it is quite windy today and I questioned
even flying today but I was like you
know what I'm good I'm good at this but
I did a sweeping shot going way up and
the bird hit the tree this isn't good
not good we need this guy
we need this drone and now I'm like we
did get a bunch of footage that is saved
to the SD card so we got what we need
here we were doing a nice little pullout
and up right Jeremy was right out there
and basically I was pulling out and I
wanted to be just above the trees so
that when it crossed the trees the trees
were in the foreground it's quite windy
and as soon as I got like five feet in
front of the trees big gust of wind came
then blew the drone into the top branch
of the tree and the world the rest is
history
that happened it's sad but you know
these things happen and luckily I
already made a phone call and I've got a
good friend we'll talk more about it
when it actually happens but I've got a
good friend who also has a drone and
he's going to be either coming to
Indiana with us or shipping the drone to
the location so we can still get those
shot so the tour must go on so I wanted
to pop the card in to see if it would if
it would play the file and this is what
my previous me so I hope so basically
while you're flying and recording it's
recording that to the iPad is what I had
it on so I need to now see if I can
export it from the iPad and I don't know
if the quality will be there but at
least it'll be able to go in the vlog if
you saw the clip I mentioned earlier
than you I was able to save it well what
a mess man what a disaster
hey Jeremy you you should feel honored
though realize I crashed the drone on
your video right it's all good dude it's
all good this stuff happens
look at this man spinning a rock spin
that rock yeah that's awesome
bye now alright Jeremy I wish we had
time to hang out and chill and whatnots
but we got work to do yeah I gotta
figure out this but seriously awesome

more stuff tomorrow and yeah just get

compassion i tweeted earlier that I was
kind of pumped because The Walking Dead
was filmed here in Atlanta when someone
at big Evan Jones tweeted us today
basically with a website called The
Walking Dead locations calm and every
single location is mapped on an actual
map and you can see where every bit and
the subway we are at earlier was the the
other side of the road is where the tank
scene is in like series 1 yeah
and we didn't know that until we've left
and come home now right yeah was the
Jackson bridge the Jackson bridge was
the the last image of the title sequence
first season 1 and I wanted to get a
picture up there today but we didn't we
didn't get to do that so maybe tomorrow
it's time to eat food so after the day
we've had
nothing better than an ice-cold beer
that'll do this is what we do now we
have to be proven proper properly you

spot called burger theory
