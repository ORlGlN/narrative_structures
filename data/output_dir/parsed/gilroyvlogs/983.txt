really
you gotta have your hand in your
eye-line right the right way down and
I'm sorry tricky one at one side maybe
it's just I was right under it right
right there
this is just great look here this is the
equivalent of bringing a knife to a
gunfight well not exactly it's still
projectile I guess but bow and arrow man
that's that's primitive bro you're
rocking the bow and arrow oh you can do
it you've got the strength you just got
to pull it back and then yeah let it go
it's really that easy Sam you know how
to make her understand archery do it do
it do it do it though the boys are down
there clearing a path a line of sight
because they have some Tanner right if
you remember Tanner right is the same
stuff that we blew up a cup of logs
black back we blew up a cup of logs back
the same stuff
and they've only got two pounds of it
while they're doing that the girls are
gonna shoot some bows and arrows clothes
move
what do you call that
you know she shooting arrow it's really
this easy oh my gosh you got it really
you can do it
you just point it
all right that's for your delicate
fingers thank you she's that so don't
cut my thumb in there is over
oh yeah then yeah you can do this
either have you ever shot a bow before
no Veronica the never once before
Archer takes the stand
milady your bow you just two fingers
usually well I mean it depends on what
you need
try your three fingers how do you do you
like just like no well yeah yeah yeah
yeah put your fingers like this yeah
yeah straight up yeah my dress you can
keep your finger up me out yeah pull oh
ha ha ok well everyone everyone does
that the first time
there you go click that bad boy on there
yeah you can do it
oh don't hold it with your finger you
just slide it along your finger how
about that stand more like and while
you're pulling it back you could turn
your bow this way a little bit so that
it stays against it how about that yeah
and then when you get yourself pulled
all the way back a lot farther than that
you got to be straight up and down with
the bow and you got to pull back partner
oh you just let your fingers go my
finger you'll be fine it's okay just
yeah just are you aiming so you get the
feel for it yeah do that dang thing I'm
living for all the gold in the kingdom
