thing that I may ever have done cuz it's
cold there right now
is it cool dude oh yeah Rome does it
cold wino in Scotland is snowing right

nope this is all ours
no bye dad we're taking Emma Emma's
coming with us tonight and Dallas I have
this idea I want I'm really really
contemplating if you're up for it
me and Dallas go uptown to all the
shopping malls and stuff and mess with
the Black Friday people or just see what
the chaos is like because I've never
been out black credit look down there
guys the first Christmas lights
whoo you farted yeah Carson have you
ever been black flash oven
once or twice what I can't believe is
that they start having these sales on
Thanksgiving like the actual
Thanksgiving Day that doesn't make sense
because that's supposed to be time time
for family I know you're thinking why
are you guys going out well
our day is done we did it all everyone
back at my house is about to go to sleep
and I don't want to go to sleep yet
festivai seems busy right
it's Best Buy's not looking like it's
too crazy I thought it'd be busier
it's not too busy nothing too crazy
there we're gonna try the the old
Walmart there's always there's always a
really good chance to find crazy people
at Walmart this looks more alive
target target is hopping how festive is
it that it's snowing right now look who
is that
see why don't we just get ourselves a
nice fake tree ring it doesn't ever raw
Veronica Veronica wants to get a real
train this year I don't know what do you
think fake tree or real tree a little a
little secret
I learned is the the main line up front
at zig-zag in and out in and out it'd
probably take two hours to get through
there but the electronic line it was
empty
yeah yeah I think this is the last spot
I'm willing to go to Walmart boom
craziness
people everywhere well I'm gonna tell
you this ain't night this ain't like no
Black Friday I've ever seen on TV it's
super quiet not a lot of people I
thought I'd see like doors opening and
people pushing each other down it's good
that we didn't say that the kids are
having a slumber party with Emma hey I'm
uh mommy's just relaxing just a long day
huh yeah
hmm we had so much fun checking out the
Black Friday stuff but it wasn't as
crazy yeah I wasn't I wasn't out of
control
I've never been out Black Friday
shopping so and I didn't know what to
get I did get a few things and I can't
show you what they are because say I
won't you insane oh yeah the prisons for
me the prison from dead but we're just
gonna chill for the rest of the nice
holiday so we're going to take from ten
o'clock on and enjoy ourselves right no
