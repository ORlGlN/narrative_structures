and their Thanksgiving Day begins by the
time you see this vlog yours is already
over and we hope you had a fantastic day
what to expect for today
Thanksgiving as most of you know our
Thanksgiving and most holidays are
filled and travel because of our huge
collective family we have many many
different places to stop and our first
stop is Veronica's
she hooked oh look at her face
Oh lysing she wanted this thing so bad
to play with but it's an actual
porcelain doll really let me tell you
guys a quick story back when I first
joined this family okay the Thanksgiving
tradition once we would eat food and
then all the guys would go out back some
had their whiskey some had their cigars
but they would go out back and they
would shoot guns and I just asked Brian
that's like Brian
whatever happened to shooting guns on
Thanksgiving he goes well I brought my
357 so we are gonna fire off a couple
rounds on this bad boy right here let's
see it nice I'm gonna deer hunt with it
next week I'm really okay he says he's
got these real special headphones or ear
protection too
that are super noise cancelling you
could hear a whisper or someone talking
but when the gun goes off its it mutes
it lets you leave a clear off but if you
turn it on turn it up and you can hear
each other talk okay
they're cool these headphones are
amazing so I can hear everything I can
hear the swishing of my coat like I can
hear everything perfectly but the sound
of a gunshot it like mutes it out these
things are awesome
warm brass boys
all right Grammys gonna get in there yep
she's a man's lady plane get the plane
shoot down the plane
keep shooting now it's a moving target
keep it rollin

just think about I didn't eat any

that I try to always eat this year or on
Thanksgiving

other thing sugar cream pie maybe they
don't go together find out I just lined
up our entire family try and do a
mannequin challenge but these guys

camera here and we're about to do this
and I'd left you here hahaha it's really
it's time we can go home now Oh
it is currently 8:50 and we have
officially finished our things feeling
synced hopefully I gave him a talk I've
had so much food our Thanksgiving
celebration is over we've had we've had
a fun day it's been fun just hanging out
with everybody but yeah now it's time to
just relax oh honey I know it's okay
daddy won't fix it daddy will fix it
look we know the dogs get into the trash
and they do it often
so before we left I knew the dogs would
get into stuff so I put the trash can by
the front door they can't get out there
because these gates that we had it
closed so instead of to chewing up trash
they chewed up a bunch of boxes and I
think they ate it back or croutons or
something and they chewed up Eliza's
malmo bad dog
angel and echo you are bad dogs for
chewing up my mama so that was our
Thanksgiving a nice round of travel
mixes with hanging out with some of the
best people in our lives
