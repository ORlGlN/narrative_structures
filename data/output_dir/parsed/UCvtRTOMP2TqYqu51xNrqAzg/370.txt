not trying to take shots but they called
themselves the green light machines but
this is red this is red light major like
you know
I appreciate that
I'm sure this won't be the last
I thought we liked
definitely
someone tweeted that he was inside
center with no badge and I didn't
believe it our first place
it puts so much pressure on me that
makes me nervous
I know it when I can get home

said cuz you know Ollie and my dad are
very close dad how long have you been
friends 25 years

been friends but anyway Ollie told me he
said he said bro when you go home please

my dad that means uncle Ron no he's not
really his uncle but he just loves my
dad he said please make sure I'm wearin
watches the basketball video so
Christopher London LSK uploaded the
crazy 3.2 V to challenge me and Olly
against him and Jessa the laser and then
Jess are uploading the two V two games
of me and alia vs. Ellis congestus so
all he wanted to make sure I had my dad
watch both these videos and he said he
wants to know what my dad thinks about
how Holly plays so because me my dad
Ollie and Bryan used to always play
outside when we were younger but that
was what ten years ago so I think all he
has done yeah my dad actually used to
beat us when we were younger I think all
he has gone a little better in the last
10 years so we're gonna watch these
parolees request that look how tall he
is so we eat shoot three from the spots
I'll leave ya my beard looks nice to
Holly Holly shooting the last one so all
these shoots the first and last and I'm
shooting the so we got eight dad you
think Ali did bad look at what geser did
look yeah my dad is literally it doesn't
miss from the corner shots he can't
shoot too well straight away about the
corners are my dad shots the come back
round to work better for him he just had
to get the nerves out
okay guys so the giraffe starts hitting
a shot so this is round two

so they got eight so we have to make
nine only one okay dad hold on what
you're about to watch from me is gonna
be crazy watch one

then I got a Superman I want to make all
of them and then for the Wayne nine and
guys we have dak Prescott rebounding in
the green shorts watch right there
winners we won the three-point contest
now this is the 2v2 game the real game
the goats all he is loser has to buy the
other team pair brand-new shoes that
they said halftime Adam Adam game up to
15 that's all I knew they were in
trouble I knew we were gonna win once
they requested a half-time get that
switch now that the game's over and we
already won me and Ollie had a game plan
before we went the game plan was for me
to set a hard screen on LSK every time
and try to get that switch get only on
gesture the laser all the time dad did
you see his threes guys honestly I'm
glad we put the two V two on Jetsons
channel because let me tell you he can't
edit crazy good his editing skills are
ridiculous I was watching this game like
okay I don't know he could edit like
that so that was pretty sick
that the comeback started that one cuz I
got scared that six foot ten giant was
gonna come from the weak side block my
shot can't guard that the comeback I
know that I'll pick you up next time how
about my defense our game plan was to
try to get that switch Oh
and then they found out our game plan so
they had to start fouling all the
down-low
oh yeah because we kept trying to get
the switch all these to go down whoa oh
I'll lead and then the smart pass you
said all these like pages so Jankovic Oh
11 9 guys too tall for the lead oh so we
need one more 3-pointer to win you
already know a dad from way down town
yeah all he loves bailiffs and Ross
actually so what did you think of all
these performance not bad all to you but
they do want the rematch so guys
whenever you wanna come down we're ready
for that rematch already
