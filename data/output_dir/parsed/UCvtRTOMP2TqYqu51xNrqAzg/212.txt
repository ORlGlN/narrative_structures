like I said it's really really early
right now
well and if you're wondering why I'm
wearing sunglasses because I just woke
up I look like a zombie
the housekeeper heard me but anyways I
just woke up I look like a zombie
straight from the apocalypse but I woke
up super super early finished editing my
video I woke up at like 4 or 5 a.m.
because well instead of telling you guys
where I'm going let me just show you
guys okay guys look this is poop how
early it is everybody all the boots are
still setting up right now I'm trying to
go shoot around but I don't see any
basketballs on the court so I'm gonna
try to see if I could find a ball
because none of the other Hooper's are
out here yet
jackpot spotted guys not only do I look
like a zombie but I sound like a zombie
right now
we got a really really big game and I
heard that there's going to be almost
10,000 people all in attendance so we're
going to be playing in front of
thousands and thousands of people so I'm
ready that's why I'm here to shoot
around to get ready for the game and I'm
excited hey guys I'm finished shooting
around I was down there for about two
hours I just wanted to get I wanted to
get used to the court alarms get you to
the ball because like I said they really
really thinking I had to show up in my
devin booker game-worn Jersey mr. Z
Devin Booker Warren Summerlee when he
was a rookie and when I went to the Sun
game they gave it to me as a gift
I have never wore this before Devin
Booker my guy and then you know I have
to read my second guy at the game Bosley
the teacher bring me some love good boy
Bosley good boy hey don't bite so we're
repping my two guys Devin Booker and
Bosley and my third guy me Jackie so
let's see they bring up some love really
really big game so there's a lot of
friendships because Kai's Omar picked me
first overall he could have had anybody
that was playing out of 20 players he
could add anybody and he picked me
because there's a lot of pressure but I
love playing when the pressures on so
tight I'm not going to disappoint you
and it's time to get this w I can't wait
all I'm by the way I was so upset when
the Phoenix Suns told me that they
washed it cuz when they gave me the
jersey as a gift
oh my god please tell me you didn't wash
it they were like yes sorry we washed it
I was like damn it so it is game worn
but it's not official because it's
what's gone through the washer and dryer
me why would you watch Devin Booker
sweat like what kind of drugs you have
to be on to wash Devin Booker sweat off
of Jersey you got to keep that like I
don't know anyway guys it's time we're
about to walk into sneaker con the game
