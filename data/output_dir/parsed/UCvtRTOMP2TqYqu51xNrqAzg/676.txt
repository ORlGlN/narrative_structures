are on our way to Vaughn's because we're
gonna buy a bunch of cakes okay today
we're doing a challenge we don't even
know what the challenge is yet honestly
we're gonna get you guys updated on that
but what we do know is it's gonna
involve smashing cakes on each other's
faces cakes whipped cream whatever we
find out Vaughn's the challenges has not
been made up but we do know that we're
gonna get messy we're gonna get dirty
not in a sexual way but just a nerdy
just in a cake throwing way whipped
cream filling way so on we're gonna take
you guys to Vaughn's and try to figure
out what challenge we're going to be
doing
all right you walking on where's the
bakery clearance legit he'll agree
clearance price brocade I'm smashing
you're not just smashing on someone's
head gosh y'all my head oh my god just a
PI's at $12 good okay

clearance bakery section here I'm never
coming back here again
okay what is this man this is Larry
nothing it's not a flavor that's
literally an ass cheek oh what a good oh
let me guess the comments a kid in
Africa to eight that I'm already
laughing right now so no need to fuckin
comment you know the cow I like called
you Africa that comments out everybody
if I think of video saying I could have
ate that fuck this piece of shit
don't fight it looks cold I know that
looks painful
yeah not worth that there's better what
to scratch these on her head
this is stones change of plan
we change the cave more be more
decorative and now we're getting
cupcakes as well listen keep in mind we
have no idea what child we're doing
we're just piling up some two-thirds and
we know we're going to smash them on
each other's faces but we don't know
that
we did do it for fun okay okay why would
you ever out of every single Gary look
at this we get get a cart
my mom thinks at our whole family's fat
asses so she buys this one the not one
when the ugly friggin buggers on table
one and I always tell her not to hey hey
kid in Africa hey Kate Africa Bucky you
got a car we parents
Wildlife that one but want my flight
okay so we got the cake cool hwhip
cupcakes I ate one they were low key
good but not good enough to save so
we're still gonna use them for the
challenge kid in Africa I'm sorry
mmm-hmm but
I couldn't find Hershey's chocolate so
we're gonna have to go with maple throne
no it's gonna get so can I shower here
you could shower if I shower with you
well what other ways
okay guys now that we've got everything
set up and it's waiting outside stop
laughing waiting outside it's time to
explain the rules before we go do this
so the rules are on this is going to be
a basketball challenge you might say oh
that's unfair cause Brandon plays all
the time and Anthony does it but it's
really not because the hoop is broken
and it's set really low and I'm used to
playing out the gym on a 10-foot hoop so
this is new to both of us and we're
going to be taking a variety of shots
first one to five points wins
we're going to be taking five
three-pointers one from each so two from
the corners two from the wings and one
from the center we're going to be doing
one free-throw and then we're going to
be doing two half-court shots half-court
it's just a really far shot um first one
to five points wins every point that the
loser gets the winner gets to throw
something at the losers face so for
example I make my first three-point shot
and Anthony misses then I throw a
cupcake out his face if he makes an I
made vice-versa all the way until the
winner who gets five points then gets to
throw the Big Blue $7.99 fucking $7.99
cake at the other person's face and uh I
guarantee you that's not going to be me
so I might as well be explaining this
dumping the cake in Anthony's face and
if I was not really understandable
explaining these rules maybe you'll get
a better an understanding when we go
outside so let's just go do this
challenge right now and there's no towel
or no there's no wiping your face until
the video is fully done so you got to
keep doing the challenges with the shit
all over your face
