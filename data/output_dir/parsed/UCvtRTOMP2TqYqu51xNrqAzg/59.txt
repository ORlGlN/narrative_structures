is what I call home and I came alone
because none of my friends were down
you guys aren't down for basketball two
times a day s and a here's the lazy one
why don't you go to the gym Dennis okay
you high like that
look what's gonna happen look what God's
gonna do okay look what God's gonna do
just know just know in the afterlife
when God's deciding what's gonna happen
he's gonna say also did you lie that one
time you said Brandon they asked you to
go to the gym but at least Dennis fix
hear me though because like I went to
the gym and I played for so long that
I'm literally starving and Dennis was
sitting here the whole time not doing
anything so you know at least you went
in like God food or oh wait actually

telling you're a girl so I can only say
that he feels dry
