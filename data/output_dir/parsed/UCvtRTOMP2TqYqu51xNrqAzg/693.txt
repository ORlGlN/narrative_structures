I got this guy's we might be witnessing
Golden State's first loss down one
exactly halfway through the fourth
quarter and apparently my dad is a
Golden State fan this season so he's
pretty pissed did he make it

since the dad no you are not allowed to
do that
Bosley doesn't even know we're about to
witness history klay Thompson is out but
oh that's dream on fifth foul five miss
tie game with five minutes hurry just
stepped out of bounds yeah right mom if
I look like Steph Curry there would be
nine girls on this couch sitting right

oh my god oh my gosh dad you know what I
think I think Steve Kerr is healthy but
he just wants to he doesn't want to ruin
it like let them keep going until they
lose and then he'll come back because
there's no way he's supposed to be out
this long as I literally love Isiah
Thomas I wish you a song the sons dad
you know he's my height and shoes he's
five foot nine and shoes
Wow Celtics ball fuzzy why are you
crying
