to underground music I don't like that
beats fruity guys so you know how i told
you like i don't really like mainstream
stuff i thought was caught balls a
different name and i just even music I
don't like mainstream music like I like
that underground shit like I don't know
if you've heard of this guy heard of the
song just listen it's all me stay true
and stop me no I don't know not a lot of
people know I'm still getting used to
his music because it's not really hyped
his name is Aubrey Graham underground
music I don't like that beats say see
like which songs of these do you know
hi guys
don't you heard enough yeah I think it's
a layout option
this is late lesson this is my song -
Jackie I don't know she agrees but
wait now I don't because it says girls
hate - girl girl but you guys already
know it's an app
guys okay good thing there's still 27
more minutes on the whole time oh my god
no they said I 80s late it's 108 what is
right here it's annex exit
this so good I should never not just you
drink I ask myself all the time
Haitian welcome Satan show bug of
Stadium guys those are the Chargers play
yes I'm a Chargers fan sadly I know
they're not going to be a fan of
everything that's just not good are they
fooling me no I'm funny
yeah the charges I'm not going to be
playing there for long that arena is
getting fucking
way out guys so let's get to do let's
just all pick it up from there
I don't think you can hear me someone
talk this close you have to be 25 years
old to get into Dave & Buster's unless
you yeah guys so you have to be 20 or
you have to be 25 to bring someone who's
not 21 in and she's not 21 so I'm not 25
so plane is coming to get us both it so
let me let me see if this makes sense if
you're 21 you can go to Dave & Buster's
by yourself but if you're trying to
bring someone who's not 21 come Jackie's
only 14
but right there
