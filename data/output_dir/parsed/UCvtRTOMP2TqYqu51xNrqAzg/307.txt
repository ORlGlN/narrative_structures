mom you think the gym is going to help
me feel better playing that song I
probably say but oh well I don't listen
the love of basketball takes over the
sickness they're playing lunchtime
basketball for the first time I had to
treat them out and then later today I
got my game we got an early game so
honestly don't ask me why I'm gonna go
play out the gym right now but like my
mom said the love for basketball is just
too strong
a meal can you close the door yes ha yep
yes sir guys you know I'm actually
starting to get used to this
not honestly like this is starting to
grow on me think about it no one else
will die a has a unique one like this
everyone else has the basic glass I have
a nice unique like yeah this is yes
because it's half convertible no guys on
we need to get this fixed no more
playing around we're waiting because no
one has the glass in stock so we're
waiting for it to be shipped out but
anyways that's not important now we need
to go play some basketball
oh are sahel starting his vlog me and
Emile just won three in a row but then
we took the house it's not bad win
tomorrow and move one not too bad
how would I rather have zero losses but
one of them bad Oh for the blog Oh for
the blog now he's going to watch my
video so I just got a extra few could
you make that job if he may say he would
I never watched it look I'm too sick to
be here I'm literally dying on the court
but we got to play yeah we got day
so time to go play my game right now I'm
not even going to lie I feel very very
under the weather cough sore throat
stuffy nose runny nose headache anything
you name it is bad right now so I
actually just went in the bathroom to
throw a while back I can't fucking I
don't even know what's going on right
now so why can't I just be healthy for
one game one game I just want to be
healthy I don't whether it's a fucking
sprain hand or back spasms or the
sickness why can't I just go play one
game and be healthy I hate it
but anyways everything happens for a
reason who knows so my mom and Jackie
obviously they're trying to tell me to
stay home and not play not only am i
super sick but I went to the hospital
for my back so I'm not supposed to be
playing right now but you know me there
was no way I was going to miss this game
so I keep telling my mom and Jackie
thank you I appreciate you guys trying
to help so I'm not going to miss it
guys look at this desk we got hot tea we
got orange juice we got motrin pills
we got freakin Elsa tissue shout out to
all my frozen fans out there but anyways
enough without me if I die I collapse on
the court whatever happens happens on
the hook I'm just joking I would care so
yeah guys today's game I'm actually
really really excited for because today
we are playing my old team I played with
them last season and I'm still really
close to them especially one guy
shoutout to Matt I talk to him all the
time
so I miss so guys look I'm grateful for
the opportunity that they let me play
last season thank you guys for letting
me play with you guys last season and
tonight we're on different sides of the
court so I miss you guys but tonight
it's game on game on this is Kevin
Durant return to OKC I'm just joking or
is it so am I gonna walk in there
they're gonna cupcake shirt so they're
gonna boo me I say today no I'm just
joking guys honestly all I care about is
not fucking packing out on the court
because this sickness is bad but it
doesn't matter there's no excuses
basketball is basketball mom are you
ready I'm too
predation Douglas Brandon that's all
that matters
cut another cut the point I don't care
about the points we just need to win
this game
yes Wayne thank you Dad Wayne thank you
Scott tonight I don't even care about
the point we just need to win we lost
two games in a row and who wants to lose
three games in a row that I can coach
yeah soon as we hire drivers and coach
we lost every day oh look it's
basketball everyone place to win you
don't play to lose you play to win the
game so that one's trying to lose three
games in a row
we got a link tonight right now we are
at five waves and three losses so you
know that's good but it's not good
enough so we're trying to make it six
wins and three losses
once again shout out to my boy Jaden who
made us be shirts these are so sick so
sick

trashcan I was about to throw up and the
rep code sir that's a violation and so I
I just walked back to miles like wait

violation you left the court
I said sir about to throw the fuck up
and he just started laughing I was like

throw up on the court and he just
started laughing like all right go ahead
but I'm literally about to throw up in
the trash and I hear it sir that's a
violation so I walked up to him I was
like sir about to throw the hell up but
you were just laughing about it he was

those are so uh big came to watch my
Begley game I'm going to watch the
football game way babe update how's your

like let me just saw up really quick and
it wasn't coming out and the rest was
like that's a violation
I said let me go out to LA I'll give in
to my latest stuff but we want that's
all that mattered was ugly though that
game was I honestly don't think we'd say
well okay you're I'm so sick right now
yeah
yeah die it looked ugly it was an ugly
game but we want to cut all that matters
on the screen you got to play better
though that was nasty now starting on my
head first of all I don't know I have
1440 let's go guys one last thing about
my boy he knows what's up we must leave
it wear socks to God I think so we're
talking on the phone laptop I think one
of the doctors on Facebook for sure
babe Everett if you wear those huge
heaters or sandals but I don't have a
girlfriend but does singing okay where's
I get your cheaters all I heard if your
girl looks like a glaze know that you
can trust that's what I've read but you
can so I don't look like that yeah you
to your house looks exciting wow so
bright well it is yo guys really quick
to close this video I just want to give
a huge shout out to everybody that came
through to the game that was the most
fans that we've ever had at a game and
it's crazy
not just the surprises like a huge Devin
Booker team poster or all the little
surprises that all you guys bring us
just the fact that you guys show up the
fact that you guys take the time out of
your day to drive from who knows where I
don't even know where all you guys come
from and come to watch the game it's
crazy so thank you guys so much for it I
don't know if you guys know this but it
helps our team so much it helps us it
really does it gives us so much more
motivation to play better so thank you
guys for that I really really do
appreciate it and I'm sure my brother
does too anyways we won like I said it
was very ugly that's not how you want to
win a game that's not how you want to
play we played very bad but somehow we
won we got really lucky we're going to
have to play way better next week and
especially play better into the playoffs
because like I said earlier in this
video we got one more game one last game
and then it's time for playoffs so if we
even think about playing how we did
tonight in the playoffs we're screwed
we're done so we got to play better
somehow we got the way so I'm not
complaining I had fun playing in that
game I don't know if you saw the random
times throughout the game
I'll just laughing with my old teammate
making jokes it was almost like I was
playing with them again it brought back
so much memories so I had fun playing
against a team I felt like shit I need
to heal up so right now we're six and
three were third place in the league and
I don't think that's bad honestly six
wins three losses hopefully we can win
that last game next week and most
Brian's going to be back so anyways
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I appreciate you guys taking your
time out of your day to watch this
long-ass video I don't even know how
long it's gonna end up being probably
over 30 minutes but but watch claws mud
Slough to all you guys one last time
thank you to all the fans who come
through to the game I appreciate it so
much and I love you guys that's it I fit
I try to say it at least once in every
single video because it's the truth I
love you guys like my second family
and one the road to two mill I haven't
really been talking about it because I
don't want to you know get myself too
excited but every time I look at my
subscriber count
it's just creeping up and creeping up so
the road to to mill is on one last time
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and about the whole car thing
we're still trying to get the current
situation figured out obviously I'll
keep updating you guys whenever we get
major news on that but but what about
things so much for stopping by and
