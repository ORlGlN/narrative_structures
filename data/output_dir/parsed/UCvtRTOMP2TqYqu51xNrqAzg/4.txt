what is going on you got Brandon here
aka Pilates and today I am here with my
teammates from hell
Brandon Justin aka Jenkins Kenny we got
to get into something super serious
today so we got a basketball game today
hopefully to basketball games I'll get
more into that later our regular season
is over today it's a playoffs we got our
first game in like 30 minutes
we got a first game soon and this idiot
but when are you gonna change really
snaps off bicycle like this oh it's like
the NBA's endpoint so but deal with
today is that they do the first round of
the playoffs and the championship on the
same exact day so if you win the first
game you're in the championship and you
play right away right after but if you
lose the first game then you gotta go
home but that's not an option for us
hopefully you guys enjoy the video
hopefully I have two games of pretty
guys like I said when the first game
playing the championship lose the first
game you go home and guarantee to
guarantee if I didn't believe in these
guys and they wouldn't be on my team so
I believe in just not believe in Kenny I
don't know how am L got on the team our
team actually got in as the last spot in
the playoffs so technically were the
worst team in the playoffs were
underdogs trying to want the champ ship
as the worst team in the club I got
faith what do you think is gonna happen
Elle's in the game you're winning no
yeah
to me regular season doesn't matter if
you're good in the races but you can't
win in the playoffs then what's the
point regular season doesn't mean
anything playoffs automatic so I think
we're gonna win the first game and end
up winning a championship
yo Justin you about to go change
no I take back I don't trust my
teammates I don't have faith in my team
we're gonna call a hold on here's a
little trick you ready go Jess are you
gonna go change all right no no you're
not kinky edit that do it snap yeah J
are you gonna go change
okay now good change so I can
behind-the-scenes of us waiting for J to
snap again
ooh there we go as long as I've been
playing Romel Justin and Kenny we've
never won a championship together all
the time we spent playing us and jam all
of you got eight of you wins but we've
never won the championship together so I
think this is a journey there's a first
for everything
just like we never thought remote
whatever looses verginity but there's no
time for that - so what are you doing
checking yourself out in the mirror it's
not about how good you look it's about
how good you play trust me I know this
is flashlight stop we got the biggest
day of the season
oh yeah this is for the championship if
I don't get it we don't win championship
if I hit it we wait hey Jay if you don't
hit it we don't win jet your fake ball I
don't associate no I don't see it with
fakes bro that's so that's team bus
ready to go on the way we got the point
guard the head coach the center right
here we got I don't know what is he a
remote what are you small forward I
don't know a benchwarmer what's wrong

three okay so can we get somewhere all
