that's it
got on the shoes that my girl got me
obviously I got to tie them just lrg
shirt with this jacket that my girl got
me
I'm decked out in my girls gifts but um
I if you're wondering why I'm dressed
right now me and Jackie are about to go
to the mall let me tell you why so
yesterday we went to the mall to pick up
gifts for my mom for her birthday
because my mom's birthday was yesterday
any level one chair you're the only one
that I want to step out in the morning
girls she wanting up and uh they have a
pet throughout the mall Jackie's always
wanted a child and she saw a Chow at the
mall so we were playing with it she fell
in love she literally fell in love with
the chow um you know how you take a dog
out and play for what like 10 minutes
she was there for literally one hour the
worker kept coming up and being like oh
are you done yet like do you want to buy
or whatever and she was just like no I'm
not done yet bah bah
she literally almost cried when she had
to give it away so like she fell in love
and I texted it today I was like you
want to go back and see your dog you're
a dog and she said yes please auntie
whatever so love we're literally about
to go back to the mall just to play with
that child she named her princess so
we're gonna go play with princess
um Bosley hates me already
imagine if he found out that I was
literally going to the mall to play with
another dog Bosley would dis he would
disown me as an owner he would oh my god
Baldy would go nuts so I'm keeping that
a secret from Bosley um so oh and also
you think Bosley didn't like me
princess literally hated me I don't know
why so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
sneak Bosley streets in my pocket and
when we go to the pet store I'm gonna
secretly give her the treats so on she
might like me because everybody loves
gifts so I'm gonna get her gifts imagine
if Bosley found out I was straight-up
cheating on him and using his treats to
get another dog to like me that's
straight-up like that's something you
just don't do that should be in the
Bible things you don't do
but yeah so not go to the mall just so
Jackie can play with her her dog
shoes the dog was actually cute she has
hated me for some reason
but Jackie's in love it's not with me to
the chouchou
well they ruin change of plans
instead I'm just going over to Jackie's
house
no no more mall we're not going to see
princess maybe the next day maybe
oh no sometime next week but it's just
going to be too much traffic
and note your house instead why by
listening to me oh why are it's not both
singing the song to Marcus Morris all
because of you December action
it's a nice rhythm and my prayer it came
to bonds to pick Jackie up some mangos
because you know what they say before
you visit Bay and you make them eat
fruit you guys know why I'm just joking
but that no but really I'm getting some
mangoes
