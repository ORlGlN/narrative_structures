birth Clippers ever since I woke up I've
been so fucking happy like you don't
even understand I swear I woke up super
early because like I couldn't even sleep
son wears Clippers in LA it's like 12:30

pretty sure my brother's doing a vlog
too but yeah so we'll be heading to LA
soon cause are you gonna miss us
go to them guys and I'm also super hyped
for this game because the Clippers are
honestly I don't like them they beat the
Suns four times last year including a
buzzer beater by Blake Griffin which I
was there live on their live when Blake
Griffin hit that buzzer beater against
the Suns so this just adds more it adds
more passion how much I want the suns to
win this game but we'll see I'm going

alright pulled over in the middle of the
freeway because my brother wanted to
post a picture on Instagram I can't post
one and drive at the same time yep
we hate traffic but the good news is
actually the traffic is really bad but
the good news is we're only 20 minutes
away us so we're 20 minutes away and the
game starts in four and a half hours
that's what happens when you're paranoid
from LA traffic we're walking to this
place called china bowl Express and it
looks like shit

hungry Brian is that oh no that's my boy
that's Mexico and I honestly rather you
Mexicans

Mexican food place if it is the nose
it smells like ass and there's only one
restaurant but yeah we're like three
hours are the wait night okay let's just
say that this food was on not not the
best of foods that I've tried am i right
so I have literally a bunch left over
but since I'm a good person instead of
throwing this away we're downtown LA so

look it's DJ in there talking Miguel boy
Markieff Morris has literally caused us
this game I don't care
down by five look 35 seconds the shakes
whipping Pam ending my blog right here
disappointing them but hey boy alright
sons will be good some sons will be good
but that doesn't change the fact that
I'm depressed right now yes the drive
home is not going to be good but we'll
see
imma get over it soon we're out right
now looking for bathrooms because before
we drive home we have to take a piss
well rug has to take a piss cuz got to
take a piss I just have to take a piss
cuz I'm so fucking pissed off that I
have to let all my piss out over the
Denny's no I'm not hungry dude honestly
the sun's kept it close and I'm not
gonna lie Markieff kindness kind of
screwed us over but we kept it close all
game we even had the lead in the late
3rd and then the Clippers just pulled
away there they're super talented
honestly and I do have them finishing
1st place in the Western Conference but
it's raining really hard on our way back
you guys can't tell my voice is fucking
gone it's wrong yeah you're screaming a
lot and I know by the way Tyson Jeb had
14 points and 17 rebounds which is
looking at Francis ties
okay guys I have to make this intro
short because my voice is freakin done
like between Halloween weekend and the
sons game last night it's like my voice
is non-existent and I had a speech today
like a four to five minute speech and
honestly I emailed my teacher and I'm
gonna have to do it Thursday first and
points off because I can't I can't speak
in front of the class for like five
minutes like this but um
sort of quick summary of what this vlog
consisted of I mean woke up drove over
two hours to downtown LA we uh pulled
over on the side of the road because I
was trying to post a selfie of me and my
brother but it was too hard to pick a
filter while I was driving so we pulled
over on the side of the freeway and I
did get to post a picture but that was
hilarious also I met Stan Verret like
you guys saw from ESPN came up to me and
my brother cuz there was a close car
accident that almost happened and he was
like that car just hit the other car and
I looked at him and I was like wait
first of all are you from sports in it
and he said yeah and then I asked to
take a snapchat so that was funny um I
mean we fed homeless we met a bunch of
fans which was so exciting like some of
them even claimed that they only went to
the game to see us which is freaking
like you don't understand how that makes
me and my brother feel it's crazy it's a
great feeling thank you guys all and um
what else yeah the sons did lose but
they were going up against one of the
best teams in the whole NBA I give the
Clippers credit for that win um the sons
could take away positives because
Brandon Knight played like shit
Markieff Morris played like even worse
shit those are second and third best
players they played like shit and we
still almost won so on against one of
the best teams in the league like I said
so there were apologies to take away
from this game Tyson Chandler 17
rebounds um a loss is a loss so I'm not
gonna sugarcoat that and I was depressed
as you guys I'm sure could tell in the
video but
no it was a fun night and I'm definitely
going to be going out to another son's
game probably within a month maybe two
and what else I promise you guys I am
gonna get a new camera I'm sick and
tired of logging with my phone I just
have to make time uh that's about it I'm
gonna conclude this log right now and
Broadus I'm out I hope you guys did
enjoy I'll see you guys next time peace
