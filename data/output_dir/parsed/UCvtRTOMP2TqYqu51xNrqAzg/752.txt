mr. 900k just broke 900k today Congrats
he's still not like me 10k but he's
getting there
so my brother just hit nine hundred K
subscribers today and after I leave the
gym I'm gonna buy him a cake but you
know me I'm not just gonna buy my cake
so he smashed that cake in his face
grocery store buy some type of cake come
home Congrats on 900k boom smash that
shit on his face
hopefully he takes it lightly hopefully
he's in a good mood about that fetty wap
accident because i know everyone's just
as concerned as I am I guess he's okay
it was I think outwards a fractured foot
or a leg but he was responsive in the
hospital on everything all those people
making jokes I mean
that was just stupid because the 1i
jokes are old in the first place I mean
like people got over that a while back
and the fact that you're making them
when the dude is boots on the floor in a
stretcher for all we know he could have
been on the verge of death and you got
one tweeze saying finally you got one
tweet saying who let this dude ride a
motorcycle with one you got one tweet
saying baby won't you look both ways
wait it's just fucked up like if that
wasn't not a celebrity everyone would be
all scared and everything but anyone
gets so much hate for no reason if you
are gonna make jokes at least wait until
you know Fetty is okay and then you can
make your jokes but I mean
okay so I just left the gym I'm about to
go buy a cake so I could smash bride in
the face with it so Bryan getting
smashed with a carrot cake
cuz that was the cheapest one but before
he does get smashed I'm gonna take a
slice for myself does it look pretty

okay so here's the cake

actually gonna let all this go to waste
I'm taking you at least a slice Bryan
has a small face so we could get it
covered with don't need the raisins

gonna call rug into the backyard and
