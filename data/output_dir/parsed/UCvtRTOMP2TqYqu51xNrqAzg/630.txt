- oh yeah I got it
this is the first time I've ever been to
Universal Studios when I wasn't ugly and
like three years yeah so all that means
is that a bunch of guys are going to try
to get hit on her so if I end up in

this this is the key to success for any
won't believe how many people had Steph
Curry Jersey Dan wagon
so ashamed
I knew Rayman
not even on ride
guys Brandon Knights number
I don't really speak
our vision is so worth making goes all
the way back to 1912 where karl lesly
started his magnificent
SiC alert
I have a room ready for unity okay hold
on
did you hear that
throw the buildings over here now in
some cases we have what are called
practical sets allowing us to film
indoors and outdoors on the same
location otherwise known as our interior
and our exterior shots but in most cases
we're going to film the Doyles look to
your right up to your screen to pay less
I had a table
so I was thrilled when Universal invited
me back just come on it's great to have
you on the ride now we have created this
3d the original Back to the Future just
celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier
this year of course we can't show you
our picture cars without showing you
some from our Fast and Furious franchise
Furious 7 our newest addition and on the
subject of new editions we'd like to
welcome those from Jurassic world our
classic Jeep Wrangler are also shown in
the original movies as well as our new
gyrosphere
that job experience you see is exactly
how it was used in production there was
no glass orb over it until the post
production process full productions that
rain as well as also another simple
effects you simply just shoot the water
straight up in the air using a sprinkler
system letting it fall naturally back to
the earth using an old film technique we
call gravity drought and all this water
does start to add up after a while your
wait examples of practical effects mean
to thank camera captures it in real time
is also where all of our monsters got
their start here at Universal was
actually invented the genre of monster
films without you fetch water and some
really really want anniversary today on
Valentine's Day 85 years ago now don't
ask me your guess is as good as mine why
anyone would release one of the first
monster movies
we go
coming
oh I think we're on the wrong shark and
George is still out there say look out
George George too late oh poor George I
get a lot of guts being out there and
there they are love me
see him anywhere what's that over there
now all of the sets you see here have
been carved out of styrofoam including
the cars there we use over 2 million
linear feet of styrofoam during
production as well as enough fake snow
to fill nine football fields but the
folks who really had more than just the
groove on them I don't want to startle
anyone but I think that is Norman Bates
right now ok I don't know he still lived
here nice fun anyway as I say before the
Bates Motel maybe he's getting all right
first of all I won't see oh really
tell me roll it when you are
I suggested clear out of the other buzz
we can't go do you sit here until I
safety alone guys we just got off the
ride how long was that like steaming out
it was literally over an hour long and I
was I was literally massaging Jackie's
like the whole time my guys all I'm
going to say is gold don't bring your
girlfriend to a theme park
