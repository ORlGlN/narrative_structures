what is going on you guys came in here
aka bodies um okay guys just listen to
my voice that should be a sneak preview
of how this reaction video went so if
you haven't been with me for a while if
you haven't been sub to this channel for
a while I'm a huge Phoenix Suns fan and
somehow someway the Phoenix Suns always
end up playing in close games really
really close games down to the wire you
know one point game two point game over
time it seems as if every Suns game is
like that and me obviously being a huge
Suns fan I get extremely you know come
on
Suns I get I get extremely you know I
get into the game I want the Suns to win
and when it's a close game you get just
like every fan of every other team you
get into the game maybe not as deeply
into the game as myself but you get into
the game so the video you're about to
watch why it says in a public restaurant
because if you know me you know I watch
every single Suns game on this TV i
watch every game by myself I don't like
to be bothered I don't like to be around
people cuz when I get mad okay look at
this hole in the closet okay like
haven't been broken a bunch of times my
wall has taken a couple beatings so I
get I get really really mad where I get
really like I said into the gate so I
don't really like to be in a public
place oh I don't like to watch the game
with other people well in this case
before the game I had done a me angry in
Phoenix and I was planning on finishing
the meet-and-greet and going back to my
hotel to watch the game well there were
so many people show up and I wanted to
do a giveaway I finished the meanwhiie I
finished meeting everyone but I wanted
to do a giveaway for all the fans that
were there and so I did a giveaway and I
looked at the time after I was done and
I was like oh shit I stayed longer than
what I was supposed to so I didn't have
enough time to go back to the hotel to
watch the game so you know all with my
friends my buddies and they were there
Phoenix Suns fans as well and they're
like oh there's a sports bar right next
to us we can just watch the game there
and in my head I'm like I don't think
it's a smartest idea to you know for me
to watch him in a public restaurant but
then I was like okay let's just hope
it's not a close game because when the
Suns win by law or if they lose by a lot
I'm usually like more calm I'm not the
comics car on earth but I am more calm
so in my head I was like okay you know
what let's just go watch that the
restaurant I don't have enough time to
go all the way back to the hotel
take it I'm gonna miss some of the game
and I don't want to do that so let's
just go to the restaurant cuz in case
you guys you know I don't miss not only
do I not miss any games I don't even
miss a minute of any games I don't even
miss the first minute of the game so I
didn't want to miss it you know me and
my friends at odds with we had planned
to go to the Arizona State Fair right
after the game you know we're gonna
watch the game and head over to the
State Fair and have a really fun Friday
night guys there was like even I
couldn't even sit down everybody was
watching the World Series because they
had the Sun game on one TV and they have
the World Series on the other TV
obviously everybody's watching the World
Series and I could not sit down like I
couldn't sit down on my chair I was too
like I was too tense and nervous I I
felt like I was gonna die and so the guy
that ran watches the World Series I'm
like oh I'm sorry if I'm in your way but
then my heart was my heart was fucking
shaking and pounding so hard that he let
me stand up you like if I sat down I'm
telling you something would happen I had
to just stand up it was crazy and in my
head I'm like you know what let's just
hope it's not a close game so I'll
embarrass myself in front of my friends
and in front of the restaurant just
watch but if you can't tell by my voice
just listen this is not my normal voice
all your new subscribers don't worry
there's not my normal voice rewards
reacts to a extremely close Phoenix Suns
overtime game in a public restaurant I
know I tweeted out earlier today that I
wasn't gonna upload I thought I wasn't
