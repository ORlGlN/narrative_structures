okay so I just finished getting my cut
if there's one thing everyone who gets
cut regularly knows is that you don't
judge a haircut until after you shower
so I don't even on my way to the gym
right now I'm gonna get a workout in
before the Chargers game they got Monday
night I think some family's coming over
to watch the game we'll see they should
win but I never want to you know say
that about the Chargers because we all
know the story
but um no I like my cut you know I trust
it same as always on my way to the gym
right now I'm gonna work out legs so if
there is such thing as a quick leg work
how that's what I'm gonna do and go back
watch the Chargers game and see what
else tonight has planned for me because
the charger game ends at 8:00 but I'm
only 20 years old so 8:00 p.m. is sort
of like 4 p.m. for me so uh oh shit I
have an essay
I have an essay due tomorrow so that 8
p.m. is not like 4 p.m. for me tonight
uh fuck I forgot about that I have an
essay due tomorrow I haven't even
started so I got to get that done but
how about I catch up with you guys after
the gym back from the gym after light
day I'm literally walking like this it's
fucking hard to walk right now my
parents are probably gonna think I'm
drunk they don't know about leg day
about being sad you said dad
barbecue for Monday night what the hell
she only got 32 points you say boom boom
Sammy there we go tri-tip
for Monday night peace charger zone I
made my own seasoning mixes salt pepper
pepper rock I don't know if this is
sanitary but I'm hungry so I'm gonna eat
it anyways gonna feel
with a milestone touchdown catch them
Tennyson's rivers - gate his first game
back first game back from his suspension
first Drive catch of the touchdown you
got these two or father Otto sure chef
like me fuck me - you would say broadly
did you see rivers complete the pass to
gates for the touchdown you don't care
Brazil show you probably a Steelers fan
huh Jesus dad it literally looks like we
cooked Bosley and put them on the grill
still seven nothing every play
first asking all my god he opened then
language throws Gordon with the wrong
spot ballpark
number rather than side it's too thick
I know how's the inside gonna cook and
will from the heat now it's now the heat
is going to cook down
para josho your budget whoa staff with
that goal
I'm gonna try it oh my god I was a
useless I went home
come on bow 5860 our hey Christian
come on get in there something uh-oh
go long that watch is gonna winter here
please no oh no fuck no way
so the Chargers just lost in the most
bullshit way possible they can't tackle
for shit honestly I said we were going
to get killed by labia on bail and what
else happens besides him scoring the
game-winning touchdown
um I mean that was a fucking
embarrassing ass final play for them to
have him stuffed and then have him
breakaway he breaks away and scores the
fucking touchdown two and three know if
this is a son's game how to kill myself
if I'm lucky it's just a Chargers game
where I'm semi pissed off but still I
honestly couldn't believe it that last
play mom what was the reaction of the
was a reaction of the dads they didn't
say nothing they just stare at each
other yeah it was crazy
Brian what did you think first of all it
was a bullshit flag to go helmet to
helmet that was bullshit but aside from
the fact the Chargers can't tackle for
shit they had him stuff before the line
and he got through Chargers loose stop
staring at him when he eats Hey sobbing
fat
you want some water one salami listen
why anything you go ooh
bud Li can't you see I'm trying to
record all you hear is his breathing I'm
trying to watch Devin Booker dribble
Archie

with a wild yet
this play will have the
let's see knee is down right there yeah
I don't know that's it's pretty good I
don't know but now time to watch
