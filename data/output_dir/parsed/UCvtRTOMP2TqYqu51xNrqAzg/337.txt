okay guys so prediction time Blaziken
has the height advantage I didn't think
he was as tall
honestly when I met him I was kind of
like I didn't think it was gonna be the
salt I've seen a few of all videos and
you put you with the Angels an idea I
don't know about shooting but we'll see
I don't know okay and could be a big
blob I'm not gonna lie I have never seen
a play and when he agreed to play me I
was gonna look it up but honestly I'd
rather be surprised so I have no idea
but yes I hide it did okay so what's
your prediction ah
honestly Jenny close well I think I'm
have to go Brandon
yeah but I'm so getting I'm gonna have
to go the branded prediction time me or
Blaziken I think you do it can I believe
Jenny er okay jr. your prediction
robotics could even blame her go like
Bosley who's gonna win yeah babe who's
gonna win
okay the pressure is on this might be
too much pressure so we're playing if I
lose Jackie is breaking up with me so a
little bit of pressure a little bit of
pressure on this game but we'll see yeah
now I'm gonna lose on purpose single
rewarded uh-oh uh-oh horde Oh did Brian
just hit the car next to him yeah who
are those two getting out of the car
they made it plays a king oh that was
jr. J I thought that was Brian I was
like behind just hit the car door I

dumbass jr. the sloth Blaziken made it

punch of the face oh so we made it were
here LA Fitness and we are about to do a
basketball 1v1 we're actually gonna be
playing up to 11 ones and twos if you
can't tell I have no shoes on right now

going to throw on the new hardest my
girlfriend got me these for Christmas
thank you both
they're not broken in yet so I'm
attempting them in today yo guys Brandon
here just dropping by to say wearing my
hardens for the first time and
attempting to break the main for a 1v1
game that was gonna be on camera was not
the best idea the first time trying to
wear them they were super stiff I
couldn't even move I learned that if
you're playing an important game then
maybe you shouldn't wear the shoes that
you're trying to break in but no no
excuses let's keep watching the rest of
this video they actually really sink
we're gonna see how they feel on the
comments were actually pretty even about
how're you predicted Blaziken how're you
predicted myself so we're gonna see he
definitely has the height advantage but
that's why it's all about height we're
gonna see what happens today
without further ado let's get inside the
cooler
so I hold on Glenn I have one rule
though I don't know if you're okay with
this but there's no pushing yes you
