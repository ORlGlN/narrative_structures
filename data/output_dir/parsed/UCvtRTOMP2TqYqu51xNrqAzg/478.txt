Lakers versus 76ers so obviously Ben
Simmons and Brandon Ingram so it's going
to be packed
we'll see so yeah we came really early
because it's going to get packed for
that game Sydney's a Negro Booker's
right down there I just went out to it
he said you would come down here like a
little bit so I told it my girlfriend
wants a picture I made it see much I
made it seem like she wanted to but now
they say is going to come down here a
little bit so guys Kelly Oubre age
literally the definition of
light-skinned tall cut tattooed haircut
green eyes yeah that's the one that all
the thoughts were they've tagged they
tagged in the NCMA tatty and they don't
even they've never watched a baseball

herself what what is your complaint she
said why don't you look at me the way
you look at Devin Booker I said babe I
don't look at him anyway I've been
trying to talk to him since we got here
and all he's doing is dealership
no am I going
baby you can't argue front row NBA game
they're gonna here
so if you can't tell the Lakers have
entered the building
soon as the Laker players enter the
building everybody went crazy it's still
the fucking Jazz and with
Spray laws and fast
yeah look all the Laker jerseys all over
there's Laker jerseys all over there
they're just watching this game because
they know the next game going to be
packed so they're getting their sheets
early so this game has a huge crowd for
no reason
exposed it's only half when you watch it
on TV it looks cool it's only halfway
exposed guys look usually the top is
closed off for Summerlee and they
actually open different just for the
Lakers game Lakers and Sixers that's
crazy it's usually sealed off the guy
drives off with a greatest rap of all
time Joey
guys I know how the hell he got down
here see he literally just walked past
the security they didn't even ask him
for a ticket and and he's down here do
you like the view Jalen

advertised but this is better than
whatever

with praise for his passing ability
money it's actually poor vision it's
crazy good
