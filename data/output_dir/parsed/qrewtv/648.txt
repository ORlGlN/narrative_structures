about the East Coast's driving on the
freeways like when I take a bus from New
York he said Oh last fall I took a bus
from New York to VA and just looking out
the window seeing all the trees and
everything it was really nice and I
enjoyed it so I do appreciate the East
Coast man I need to go to more places in
the East Coast
