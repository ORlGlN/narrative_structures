they're only at like boutiques guys so I
didn't know I could do this but this
thing saves all your footage on the app

yesterday in the comments there was a
lot of talk about me calling my viewers
fans I totally agree with you guys I
don't think I have fans I had I think I
have people who are fan of my work and
our fan of my videos for me personally I
call you guys supporters so I kind of
set it the wrong way
Faton fits better at the title but as
far as like for you guys I prefer you to
call you guys supporters my crew I think
fan is just if when you say my fans that
you try to put yourself above everybody
else and that's definitely something I
don't want to do because when I say my
crew like we're a family we're an equal
we're all equal so yeah I just wanted to
address that so I'm sorry if everybody
took it the wrong way
what about your fancy I don't have money
you only have haters you're my number
one fan yeah real friends I can't stand
this thickness happen
I can't stand when escalators don't work
clubbing about us and walk okay yeah
maybe I need the exercise but what if
somebody's hurt they can't walk upstairs
