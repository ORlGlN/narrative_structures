oh this crazy to me everything working
out perfectly seeing you stressed it was
hurting me my momma always giving me the
third degree like everybody's problems
sound along call the police this is an
emergency
hola what's good guys so today is the
last and final day that we are in New
York City it's getting a little rainy
out here it's not raining right now
thank God we're finally out of our hotel
it's about noon we're still on Cali time
and yeah man we're going to do some
shopping today and then around 4 o'clock
we're going to go with Adam and some
buds in basketball all right guys so as
you guys saw in yesterday's vlog I
bought the Kobe 11s but some actually
get a room
I'm actually gonna return them because I
can get them back home and yeah I just
I'm gonna wait till I get back home I
don't want to carry them and all that
stuff and I want to get something down
here that I can't get back in the bay or
in LA so
returned season in footlocker yeah
what's up that yo-yo fab don't do that
stop hey come on bro how you good back
haha alright guys so we're about to hit
the first sneaker store I'm in a sneaker
store it's fricking Foot Locker but
whatever it's house of hoops I believe
this is one of the first house of hoops
in the world but I could be very wrong
hit Washington and open this yeah George
Washington open this and let's see what
they have in California this would sell
out
they're max LeBron lights they're Max's
huh
all right so I was wrong it wasn't even
a house with hoops in there
so I'm pretty sure that's not the first
ever one anyway off to the next store
we're going to go to flight 23 hopefully
they have some hidden gems and see what
we can pick up we're not going to any
like boutiques or any flight club or
anything like that just because they're
out of the way and keep it real with you
guys mean go catch out you know like I
said in yesterday's vlog why would we
cash out we all think well we have the
plug so in the plug-in in New York we
don't got no type of plug in before
making power moves even though it goes
down in the deal now they go down and
steal yeah literally
I guess you're about to enter into foot
action aka the first flight 23 store
let's get right into the news
those are you can only get here in the
entire world you can only get those here
you know why and why see oh my god I'm
so tempted right now oh my god check it
out y'all the six shoes that Jordan wore
when he won his championships you got
the sixes the sevens the eighth the
Elevens the twelves and the 14s not the
13s with the 14s it's crazy yo they got
some nice shoes man as you guys know
everybody keeps treating these to me as
I didn't pick these up I passed on them
I don't want to pay retail from these
are too expensive I really want these
but I don't think they have my size so I
got the Jordan ones the NYC edition hair
is passed on them it's no debating I'm
telling you means making a mistake even
though they're not there they're there
exclusive to here they're not hard to
get but you can only get them here or if
you pay resale price so it's just
something cool to have actually did buy
them back when I came here in February
anyway we're going to go get some shoes
now because uh we got to go ball with
Adam and slim soon so we're going to go
buy some ball shoes because I returned
to Kobe's and probably just going to
pick up some kairi's and then yeah so
that's what's next on the agenda is
there any other stores you want to go to
want to walk there you want to Hoover
probably uber huh it's a mission
Hoover sighs huh I really swear that I'm
holding me back let me take that off the
table
cuz losin ain't an option and I'm
getting tired of labels alright guys so
you're trying to find a Nike outlet to
get some shoes and we thought we came to
a night gala but I guess is a Nike
running store maybe they changed it
let's ask what it's not a factory store
it is a running store and we're not
running we're playing basketball so
we're going to go to a regular Nike then
I guess at the end of the day don't
matter what shoes are on your feet it's
about how hard you ball and we're gonna
fall hard there are some that's like 20
30 40 for you yeah
they were so sparking a conversation
