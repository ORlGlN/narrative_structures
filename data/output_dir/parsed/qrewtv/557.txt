Halloween Salaberry Taliban brochures
yeah dummy dummy jump in and boy
something so lights please
I wasn't gonna vlog today um just gonna
lay back and relax but I decided to just
turn on the camera for the hell of it
for you guys because I do have something
that I could just throw into the vlog
which is bloopers and on deleted scenes
from from sneakerheads be like part 4 so
after this little cut right here you
will definitely see behind the scenes
and uh bleeded and bloopers I'm tripping
out right now man I was at the light
right now minding my own business
waiting for the light to turn green and
BAM
someone just smacked me in the back of
my car luckily I'm okay two people
another car okay the cars are okay no
one's heard that's what's most important
um yeah there's no damages to my car
luckily at all which was really
surprising because they kind of hit me
pretty hard but it kind of shows you
that sometimes you know it's not about
how safe you drive it's about other
people being everybody's responsible for
one another when it comes to driving
like put your freaking phones away I'm
guilty of this too I use my phone while
I'm driving but put your phones away and
like don't be selfish enough to worry
about yourself when you're putting
you're putting other people at risk you
know I'm saying you might look at your
phone and not see the light and you
smack me in the back of the car there's
no damages at all so this is all just me
