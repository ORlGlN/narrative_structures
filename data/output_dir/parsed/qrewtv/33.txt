my guru sneaker youtuber the sneaker con
hoops classic this time around it's a
three-on-three basketball tournament and
for round one we pretty much dominated
the team and it was easy breeze to zero
in the series oh look at that move right
there always follow your shot
yeah round one was easy got the W but um
yeah
round two we pretty much got murdered by
B dot
forget our dojo
yeah you had a sound the first round
wait wait say it again do not us out in
the first round yeah that's all guys
know the thing about it is VDOT started
cooking oh yeah you could cook it and
fatigue was the biggest factor and we
that last game we could have took
advantage of those free throws but let's
just say yg again
and I told them to about he told you
know I'm you're a short short college
basketball with me
it's all family though me and watch you
were going at it on the court
whatever you see on the court doesn't
apply outside of the court we're all
family the reason we're all here you
told me love me on the court
well that's true first one to five
Oh
you see all this stuff going on at
sneaker con it's all cool but you know
my favorite thing is the trading pit
this is where you find the real hustlers
the future resellers the young kids who
are future millionaires
you don't need a booth you just set up
on the floor and you grind you try to
make your money you look for your
sneaker trains you get what you want but
me I'm an idiot I just go buy it for 50
my only pickup for today we got these
are what the kairi's this is like the
asia exclusive colorway and then the
fear of god bands and the red
