so today we are at Pismo Beach about
three hours away from home it's Memorial
Day we decided to come here Ashlee is
surprising me
by taking me what is it called a TV
a ppm sannan-san duty no we have but you
can run empty ATVs are just there's just
different kinds of so there's sand dude
3d TVs there's more wheelers there's
just a whole bunch of redneck stuff to
do should be really fun I'm excited it's
still early now it's before noon or is
it new I don't know but let's go have a
good day guys
okay so we just got done with the ATVs
it was super fun I had a really good
time definitely want to come back and do
it again maybe even did a two-person a
little whatever it's called but uh yeah
it's really it was really fun so I'm
really glad I actually brought me for
today I definitely want to come back and
do this again since I got all experience
towards the end and actually hit her
head on the front steering though but
she's okay
she's good to go and yeah anyway we're
gonna go wash up and then go meet two so
we we went to go eat after we did the
ATVs and then we went and napped in the
car for like an hour and a half now
we're gonna go watch the Warriors game I
had already started but that was a
clutch so that on that we took in the
car we just parked in history it was
nice
now let's go Joe go grab some ice cream
first and then go watch the games
so warriors loss we watched a game at
this bar right here and you know it's
3-1 it's all good
I don't think Rockets won I think
warriors lost but that make sense they
just played really bad those Warriors
played bad so I'm saying that the
Warriors lost the Rockets didn't win
Rockets didn't
it's an old basketball saying you know
anyway this area is dead like Pismo
Beach is not cracking at all
but it was overall it was a really fun
day so I had a great time it's time to
go drive three hours back home as she
sleeps good Gator so yeah we'll see you
guys when we get back home looking at
the frame they don't see my vision
pictures always change but I stay on my
mission got the same goal same feeling
what I'm doing but I'm coming down from
a different angle this is real life you
don't know what I feel like got a lot of
voices in my head when I hear right
you must think it's all good cuz I smile
the only one and those ain't laughs in a
while come talk to us
