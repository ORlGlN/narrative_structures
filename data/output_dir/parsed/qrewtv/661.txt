come back with this double date vlog for
you guys so you guys can enjoy this if

day okay today's two tomorrow's Tuesday
so Monday and Tuesday combined in one
day tomorrow is Game six of the NBA
Finals it could be the Warriors winning
the NBA Finals which is crazy to say
it's unreal still to me it's insane to
have the Bay Area the team that I've
been watching since I got into
basketball win a championship I thought
I'd never like I thought about like I
used to think about this like will I be
alive to ever watch the Warriors win a
championship and it's possibly going to
happen I'm not going to get my hopes up
yet because Cleveland might win the next
game and take it to seven so we'll see
what happens currently going to dinner

high school so we are all getting
together for some dinner at BJ's
