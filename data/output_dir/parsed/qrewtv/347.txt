for the window is an easy weekend you
want the easies which he tries to size
so off you want the easy indeed nothing
let's just say we adding to the
collection yeah guys I also didn't state
okay so I bought these in a size 10 and
they warned me that they fit small but
they fit that ass small I need like a
ten and a half or an 11 in these so if
anybody is wondering about sizing on
these definitely go either size up or a
full size oh yeah pants up or full size
I was at least a full size like I
usually rock like eight and a half eight
I usually run eight when I wanted to be
really snug so I was actually gonna like
group and go running in these but they
fit like way too good Shan Shan crossed

again you guys saw that I want these in
the keymaster I just had a feeling man
