lessons were learned I mean I'm sure

two was one was about Elmo learning how

giving up and persevering and succeeding
and I thought that was awesome cuz

filling is not a big deal okay
I hope mama could teach you that while
you're growing up cuz filling is not a
big deal he learned from his mistake and
he got it the second time around and
then the second one was Oh when you lose
something it's okay don't panic and how
to handle stress so they taught you how
to breathe in breathe out relax and it's
not a big deal and then they threw in
something that was a big deal like a
catastrophe and then they were able to
still relax maintain level-headed and
solve the problem as a unit which is
what you gotta do okay teamwork makes
