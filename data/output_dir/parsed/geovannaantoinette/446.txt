horn cartilaginous part of you yeah yeah
but if you don't think of it as a meat
you think of as a vegetable yeah
that's different yeah yes if you don't
like the texture yeah we do this a
little bit different than what I'm used
to it those pieces are kind of thick
actually I know it's because I know they
slice it really thin yes it is a better
if it was thinner yeah and it's not this
bowl you know and I use this chili oil
on it didn't use that one cuz it reminds
me of a arm when I ate it before it
reminded me of like the live octopus but
Marie and I mocked was with chili sauce
yeah but this one was kind of thick
actually yeah this was uttered and I if
I had to saturate each other exactly
I probably yeah I like it's it you want
some food some weird stuff when guys
talk about weapons this is what they
look like
don't pretend to sure there's a saying
called uh I was trying to sell mood and
smooth is fast
so in the beginning when people try to
go it's actually like they don't get
there so that what they want your
practice move is slow the slow is smooth
and smooth is fast and eventually that
will become a really like a clicking
stick motion but in the beginning you
just stop fucking all crazy then it's
like your heart beats all over the place
and your fucking arm is like huh did you
give us money that's how I look like
when I play a video game okay my
character the vinegar looks like that
it's a fucking video game dude I've been
studying his movements slow is smooth
smooth is fast ease the way he practices
is uh is like holster training yeah he
gets new holsters and he'll just be like
he just does it slowly he just does is
he just basic basic all the time yeah
basic and it's just regular movement too
and then after a while he gets faster
and faster Master slowest move with this
guy you know it's funny about Joe what
he says some really profound shit but
it's hard to take him seriously
because he wears shirts and and clothes
like the one he's wearing right now last
