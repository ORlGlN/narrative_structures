right side of my bear notes you're being
a big jerk you're not excited for sugar
fish but you're here you think a big
jerk I'm the one that gave you that idea
right are you still being a big jerk how
am I being a big jerk shit only cuz I'm
flirting with you
don't flirt then son fine I won't flirt
today can we be on good terms
can you be nice yes that's my forte they
used to call me barn I see corn well it
did it yeah you did they called you
pinky troublemaker
they call me that too but as from a
different crop finally do we have a
truce yes what are you excited then
being is that hard who this black bar
whose marshal I left it's tomorrow oh
are you excited for sugar fish cuz you
never been before right you never been I
don't know Americans what have you heard
about it it's good that is good that's
it no one else ever told you anything
about sugar fish Beach I used to work
here that's all you know yeah and it's
good that's it
no the what really separates them from
everyone else is that the fish is
lukewarm okay but the rice is warm
thank you thing about thing that's a
really good thing oh sure oh we gotta go
yeah no but that's the part that really
separates it is that the fish is cold a
little bit cold like luke cold like
lukewarm cold and then the rice is warm
what other place have a havoc never no
one does it that way now no one else
does it that way and also that's also
reason why like if you order a bunch of
fish they don't bring it all out at the
same time because the fish is going to
start changing to the temperature of the
warm rice so they always bring it out in
courses so if you order like one like
salmon they're gonna bring out two
pieces of salmon and that's that you
have to eat it there because as soon as
they change as soon as it stays on the
table too long the fish changes
temperature and it doesn't have that
sugar fish effect Vito's telling me that
it was a competitive eater yeah he was
like fucking I go sugar fish that's
gonna shit ton of money I'll just bring
everything all at once oh no you know
it's not going to be as good because I
don't care I just want to eat that's my
second that is a shit ton of money
though oh shit sorry
that is a shit ton of money
what do you like about sure to fish my
bear exactly you just described the fact
that it's warm
and the readout of courses chefs like
nope you gotta eat it ethic comes out
that sounded right yeah oh there's
Salmons hell up on here because they put
sesame seeds on it yeah well what are
you
I usually they usually have a preset
menu you get a preset menu and then you
add stuff to it so be ready to drop like
30 to 50 bucks I want to you're like oh
there's bondo
pretty Vasya
this is downtown LA and it rarely rains
in LA but today is one of those where
days that it does rain and it actually
feels nice to be walking around downtown
and cuz I usually don't have an
opportunity to I'm so busy so even
though I live in LA I live in the
suburbs so I'm either in Alhambra
or I'm driving to the location I need to
be at but it's cool to be in downtown
and to be able to see like these mini
skyscrapers with the fog it's just very
very scenic and beautiful and it makes
me like not take that labor cran because
it is actually a beautiful place and a
lot of business goes down here but uh
just glad that I have the day off today
where I have the luxury to walk around
and look what we have here baby
sugar fish
yeah like beautiful from this angle
ya know huh yo change the subject

No
your life lessons
yeah
/ no 4 or the variation to the Chinese a
cesium clock
Conte based multi-course meal sushi
sashimi junkie selling left is going to
be your standard size but then more and
then I have a daily special
right now we're featuring the unagi
sushi tanake is going to be the debate
freshwater you sounds like a nice sweet
savory dessert
maybe
we get ice cream tea please
I screen see I think
I usually get the Nozawa Hammacher Davis
wishes that you go right
nobody sent me so that would not go
nice to see
fresh water here that is a daily special
but you get hooked up for the lotto
you get halibut snapper or maybe I'll
get this one I'll get to trust me cuz
I'm not a big fan of unagi I'll eat it
rice whatever
I'll get the trust me and I'll probably
order all the car
all of us all apart
so they got like like you can get
scallop all kinds of stuff
Unni the Nozawa style shrimp I think
that's the wrong one don't spray bomb so
we have a true small bear yeah be nice
how was I not nice you told me to sit
man in your pocket and tuck it and then
when
like that's I wanted to do
we're nothing
I did ask for it
can you do it then
while back
start an ice cream cheese hot gooey
right thank you mom
I love you
little wasters been here Oh No
the lease does not it's like they took
it out of the shell
not one this is whatever you were I love
you
monsters
what's the first course it is tuna in a
ponzu sauce it
so this is a pursue chef hats in Japan
oh you gotta compare those two though
are you ready to eat your first piece
Oh
the sushi is the best part so you just
got away for the sushi but the flavoring
and everything is really light and it's
really good
every choice I
yeah where they make it it's all you
feed every day anyone could eat it every
day
all right Nadeem this is your first
piece of sugar fish sushi
yeah hi that one
Oh
and that's right and the rice is warm
right try the salmon one did lightly be
careful the rice is really loosely
packed
the sesame seeds are on point right it
really makes the salmon like pop off
the fish does
the rice the warm rice is like a sugar
fish specialty that's like their own
signature warm rice not but everything
is a room temperature though so you know
out here like don't have cold ass fish
or like cold ass rice they made
yesterday because they're trying to
mass-produce it and everything just
tastes cold that never happens in Japan
everything is lukewarm they make it
how do you like it oh mama bail
it's a mama love you see I know Papa
loves you I named it another love it
this fish is amazing this is also my
first sushi
so glad that it was gonna be sugar
high-quality fish but unfortunately
Japan's regular fish is still better
just because most of the places that I
ate in Japan for sushi you don't even
need teeth you just put the fish the
sushi in your mouth and you can use your
tongue
and then just knock the whole thing
apart a sugar fish is still happy your
teeth
that's the biggest difference it's crazy
how how much higher quality the Japanese
fish is in general
started with really good ingredients
much better but it's also not considered
official small
just because and this get priority and
all the
but overall I'm really happy with I'm
glad that this is first meal battery is
still delicious
but what you have in front of you is
actually pretty special not that many
places have albacore belly so I want you
to tell me what you think how it tastes
very yummy is it fatty or buttery soft
something else
my turn okay cool it is good here you
can't go wrong here
and they already season
cause it just tastes lighter and crisp
they
or it's too soft this sounds like a
perfect amount of citrus for my for my
taste but that is
what did you have the first time it was
just albacore right and then this is
specifically the belly which is better
here
so different to the point where I fight
just again
my order that order
this is this is my best favorite when
what is it blue hand crab roll you love
this so this is actual real crab unlike
that fake red and white stuff
right yeah right this deuce with that
crispy seaweed named fucking around look
at crispy a seaweed a fucking around

bitchy and a parent and that doesn't

that want to get with a cute girl so
they get but the only way that they can
date her hair is if um so you pretty
much have it on just like work and stuff
yeah got it bring you listen to
everything we're saying so today's been
a pretty chill day we have JK off the
whole week and it's not necessarily like
we don't have any JK responsibilities
it's just physically we're not required
to be there so we're not filming we're
not um we don't have to be in the office
we don't have any meetings or anything
like that for JK but I do have emails
and I do have a few other things that I
have to work on one of which I'm super
excited to work on and it's these guys
our pitches so for 2016
one of our biggest goals is to be able
to my god sneeze plus oh shit that's
crazy
bless me not boogers anyways we family
you guys don't care but um well one of
the things that I'm really excited about
about 2016 is that we're gonna be
working on longer form content so on
YouTube everything is like 5 minutes 10
minutes and maybe I'm most of stretching
it with like 13 minutes especially with
the programming that we have right now
like JK news or JK films life starting
that stuff
the longer format stuff we're trying to
work on though is like TV ideas so
that's 30 minutes to an hour and feature
film ideas or webseries ideas and so we
already have a compiled list of ideas
and Casey just sent me an email and
these are the ones that we've been
working on he kind of finalized revised
it and since me and Joe are the chief
creative heads now I just have to take
the idea that he kind of polished up I
just give it the last look over and make
sure everything is on point and kind of
give a few other adjustments and boom
we're going to send it out so we've been
meeting with a lot of companies some big
companies doing some big players in
those companies I'm really excited is in
the beginning of our entertainment
career we met with a lot of people I can
be we had me as a Comedy Central and
voice acting places like a lot of these
meetings but all these guys were kind of
like the people that don't really uh
they're not shot-callers at those
companies so those meetings never went
RIT anywhere you know like a lot of a
lot of our friends like David Davis Oh
Timothy DeLaGhetto a lot of our homie
sue they they have all kinds of
Hollywood meetings but they don't really
go anywhere because you're meeting with
people I don't really pull strings and
this time around we're able to meet with
a lot of people that are the heavy
hitters and are just hopefully we can
really get some of this content popping
so I'm really really excited about that
and so although today is just kind of
like a real chill day it's uh it's very
refreshing you know like we've been
having such a hustle and bustle work
schedule for like the past I don't know
how many months and to be able to just
chill out get sugar fish and just hang
out with my family my dogs geo and the
Dean and then work I worked out in the
morning and just kind of take everything
I like a very casual pace without any
time deadlines oh shit 1:00 p.m. I gotta
be here
dude are you gotta be there through kind
of be there it felt really good felt
really refreshing actually didn't even
took a nap earlier and I just because I
thought all over the tire and I feel
really good know I'm creatively they're
gonna write some pitches
and I'll give you guys a sneak peek I
won't tell you what the pitches are but
I'll give you a just a little you know
it's the little teaser so we have an
idea about an after-school Academy we
got a an idea about a DJ music video I'm
also not going to tell you whether these
are TV or feature film series we got one
about an underground fighter
we got a buddy cop movie we got a
fugitive transport story got undercover
mafia story and we got a pizza delivery
man story so that's it that's all you're
going to get until these things get
development these things do take time
who knows maybe 2016 in all 2017 all
this can take that whole time to develop
and we won't even see anything on screen
or even released on iTunes Netflix or
anything until 2018 but the goal is to
land something in 2016 so that's the
goal my work on these themes and I'm
gonna concentrate and hopefully
everything turns out good and there's a
random page whatever no no what is Oh oh
my goodness so before you can even get
to the actual beginning of the book
there's like all these pages right like
knowledge meant this one says this book
is disgusting by Roberts mom
