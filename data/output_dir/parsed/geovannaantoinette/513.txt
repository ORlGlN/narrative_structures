Hawaii and I love Hawaii
cuz the weather is beautiful the beaches
are beautiful and I'm gonna be swimming
I'm going to be snorkeling but more so
what I love the most about being in the
water of Hawaii is filming the marine
life because it's kind of like a
combination of all my loves which is
swimming which requires athleticism
filmmaking and also being able to keep
up with fish and stuff so uh I bought
some stuff to make my life my life I
bought some stuff to make my life easier
I got this neoprene camera strap just so
I can hang on to it and just have a
draped over my shoulder and then I got
this the Sony it's like a monopod action
monopod but as also has another strap so
I like straps because I could just keep
it on me as if it's like a ar-15 and
whenever I need it
I'm just boom bust it out and I can
capture what I don't want to capture but
I also need this thing so I can film
like little fishies that would be
otherwise scared by my big body and if
I'm just like hiding in the corner of a
coral then I just take a little stick
out and then kind of capture some fish
and then I also got a mini tripod thing
just so for out eating and stuff I could
just set up the camera put it there and
we can all have a good time and I get to
share all these moments with the AI so
basically I'm following all these things
so I can share all these moments with
you guys better which is going to be
awesome

where are we Bart I'm sorry Abigail
quarters headquarters aka Studios today
we have it for contestants going
head-to-head or nah in world world
October 29th to the November 1st
November 14 14 who is going to win is
the real question these two rivals are
going to go head-to-head in the 500
pound class all right first off we have
Joe spank Lynn huh and then Chris also
known as we DS in the harbor Nadine how
do you feel about the upcoming me I
don't know but we're talking um I know
who's gonna win he's holding that be
whoever gets the highest total why say
why she survived so fearsome that might
be AA white gun champagne yeah did I go
topics under arrest
how do you feel about worlds I feel
pretty good yeah how do you feel about
Joe do you think he's a strong guy do
you think you're him he's a studdy Damon
I lose to him I don't know what wait
Nadine said that a joke and we're raps
and you still went oh we need a confirm
if it's true that you said that I'm not
gonna confirm or deny
oh shit sake Joe spangling do you want
to know how you're feeling for this me
this is your first world meet he does
have experience behind him so how do you
feel well hey sir you know mr. oh dear
let me hold a microphone thank you
Oh God joe said he smiled when he did
the 600-pound OMG
this way Nadeem might have me on squats
oh we might
Oh
what is good oh alright I can pull his
deadlift with one hand oh shit I got
Tommy don't I become two worlds don't
sleep hey yeah
what are you playing I'm totally out
world sneak what is heart he said sixty
heart let me hold that counter for him
really quick okay selfie if Nadine
follows the program a hundred percent
he'll total sixteen hundred oh oh but
he's not going to
so I'm guessing all like fifteen hundred
fifteen fifty all right and also your
opinion for Joseph inkling what do you
think he's going to total honestly based
off of what you know based off what I've
seen I think he can total at least
fifteen thirty I think if he trains hard
and I think he's hungry and I think he's
more diligent than the demas Oh
so Nadine if he doesn't work hard he
doesn't stick to the program he's fucked
we gonna close over here alright cold
idea I mean just faintly what do you
think you're gonna total 600 Oh what do
you think he's in the toilet now when
he's going to say based in honest answer
what you totally lost me what did you
get his Torah lecture last me know nice
phone up what did you tell 1973 what did
you total 15 2001 have to emphasize that
all right so what do you think that a
total at this meeting I'm saving him
your honest opinion uh he's getting
coached by Joey flex who are this is
sure joint flex is really good also
stronzo
and if he sticks to it I think he can
get at least like a 50 feet whoa -
opinion what do you think you can total
based off of what you know and his
training in the strength honestly if
he's following barge program and
actually sticks to it
he hit 1602 but most likely he's not
gonna follow it there's like 15 why is
me son Oh
thank you guys for a day sunday sunday
sunday sunday i am be there or be square
doodoos or nah nah
