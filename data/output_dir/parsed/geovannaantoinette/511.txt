oh he's candy
I know it's candy but it's breakfast
time bar what time is it it's probably
like nine o'clock wouldn't it be really
nice if you had some cool friends about
you a griddle so you could cook a really
good breakfast instead of eating candy
for breakfast that griddles yeah I just
have a no friends oh so say it's
thinking a no friends day but your beard
game is strong anyway scores are hand
here we didn't know what to make of you
your beard game was strong you kind of
really didn't speak you know in a way
that we can understand just do to your
hand Chester's in a variety of I'm weird
Middle Eastern accent well that that's
not an issue but here's the thing when
you first started here they took you
listen to a son open your eyes when
we're talking on your uncle okay this is
your adopted uncle it's complicated
but when we first accepted you or took
you in here we wanted to build you up
I'd make you stronger teach you the game
educate you on how to edit videos and a
variety things so you could go and do
your own thing Road big doesn't make
money yeah to grow stronger and become
yourself and as time is going on
you have become stronger you have become
better right what's happened what's
happened you recently what's the recent
Mickey killed at 6:01 deadlift 551 squad
great 371 benchpress I remember when I
last came gettin a deem are you looking
at me I remember when you last came down
here what happened
you tried he tried like 315 with me or
something like it was mega optic and he
missed that he's shown clear progress
not to mention that the videos you edit
are phenomenal you have your own twist
on them they have a nadine light quality
clearly you're learning a lot from both
Bart and geo as you can say your adopted
parents and as parents is as uncles it's
our responsibility to let an individual
know what's going on
look you've been really important to the
team your vision is and you're not
integral to the team barbells kind of
like here around the corner you can go a
little bit further that deep down to
blocks to the right and that's where
you're going to be working out for now
maximal your 24-hour fitness buddy
you're off the team
team will continue to train without you
but you're off the team you off the team
buddy we ask that you don't make an
issue out of this
so you just kindly leave so actually
that's not our stuff that's your stuff
back bro I got the fucking bed is your
bed our body so these are your
going-away present
you got a peg these are gonna walk out
we got your Ranger gift and we got your
sword to defend yourself that's it
that's the guy on the dog sword oh my
god you guys make me feel better so good
no it is this for your Grove we're doing
it for you now us was never about us
Nadine we never want to see our son
leave the house no with the kikyo
because you haven't shown you know
initiative to leave the house what can i
really take your sword you're so ugly
that's true that's true love my thanks
overbearing father
bye we'll be there
by
so me and the Dean all right Sammy's in
Elaine's you got to get some camera
stuff from Hawaii and this is also in
the team's first time so I'm pretty
excited show him because he really likes
video stuff and I got a ton of videos
done here which one do we get off him
Oh No okay so Sammy's is like this huge
video photo place in LA that's three
stories huh and they are all kinds of
shit all so I'm trying to find a strap
where I could just hang it on my neck so
I can swim and be hands-free and then
when I get in the water that I could
just disconnect it and record stuff
underwater but mainly everything they
have here that I've seen so far our bags
they got a ton of bags but I do see a
strap section and I might be able to
kind of like Jimmy something together or
Mickey Mouse something because this one
is pretty close it has an actual
disconnecting so like I can tie this
around my waist even though it's for the
neck and then I can just go like that
and that'll serve the function that I
need damn I can't put it back with one
hand so that might be an option so I'm
stuck between two of them there's the
strap that's slightly curved which is
more ergonomic on my shoulder but then
if I wanted to use it as a belt then it
would probably fit funny on my waist
this is more straight so there's
probably more applications I can put on
my shoulder and use it as a belt but
then if I'm swimming through water I'm
gonna find if I get caught in a violent
current because this under belly is like
rubber and has double stitching I feel
like it won't snap in half
but also the question is how often am I
gonna get caught and a super-strong tide
like that and if I only go snorkeling
like once a year
is that even a main concern of mine the
price difference it's only six bucks
it's not a big deal but I do also like
the multiple form function of this one
what would you guys choose I'm still
deciding what you guys go for the more
form function but less reinforcement or
a more specified function but a lot
thicker reinforcement you wanna go
Lindsay like you know otherwise I
would've been really creepy which lens
you got me the super wide one
oh it's like a 15 maybe 15 15 millimeter
I'm not sure knows are way better
Missy but it's like that just moving it
that's pretty good
is there any warp on the edges no it's
pretty good it's 50
oh it's 50 oh I thought you're asking
about wide angle once they do lens
repairs on a single boy oh yes oh cool
listen this one's water this is pretty
cool
that is pretty legit for the price my
amazon does nearly can't go wrong or
never high 5500 generally between I
think the 85 is like 350 so from about
350 to about $700 you can get any of
these are for that market so the price
point you really can't go wrong
yeah um if you're looking for someone to
give you a nice pool a good through
there they've been oh cool came across
another slang section this one has a guy
that looks like he could be my cousin or
something and it's just as long this
could be something I could use
oh you need to have that hook thing but
I'm trying to connect it to a compact
camera which doesn't have that Hough
thing but can I put that hook thing on
is that what's possible more options
let's say this one is a molded shoulder
Stratos is also hooking this one's also
a hug thing so many options all right so
I think I found a perfect strap for me
this is called the cross shot the
shoulder strap is made out of rubber so
I'll stick on me
but on so I know for sure and it has the
quick-release that I was looking for
right here so in case if I'm swimming it
take it off boom
Oh has three points of protons oh god
put your thumb in there extra security
boom take it out and it has this little
hook I can put this into the waterproof
housing and then if I need to I can take
it off the waterproof housing really
quickly pop bad boy back on and then I
found this boom Pole which is super
legit carbon fiber and I can extend it
and I can record with it on and the
other one I bought ballast is the
regular Sony one it was for the Sony
version of a GoPro so it was kind of
weak and as I was swinging around the
ball head with just swivel and moving it
I felt like my camera was gonna pop off
and it wouldn't I wasn't able to hold
position so I think I got some legit
stuff and I'm ready for a ride
what are you eating with a always good
it was only like four five pounds of
bread before the knee comes down
so already people it's like the best
features on right now we're not for

underwater housing completely set up now
BAM

then at the bottom I got the boom pole
hooked up to it so I could film myself
on other things and this thing extends
to about 3 feet and boom I got the strap
