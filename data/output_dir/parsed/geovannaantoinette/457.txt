strong I've been getting very strong so
very happy you know it's crazy
I'm trying to do the opposite and I'm
trying to lean out again
cuz all Boutwell come on it's film all
because although I am I still wear the
same this is where a lot of girls are
just people have that misconception that
you have to pay attention to the number
on the scale and here's proof that you
don't and you shouldn't do that is
because I still weigh the same that I
did be pre boot boot lit up pre boob job
raised at least like a powder tea right
yeah and um I've been out of like
tracking macros for about three almost
three months now alright no three months
almost four so I weigh the same but my
body does not look the same at all
there's like a lot more fat in the tummy
area that's exactly what happened
you haven't been training either I
haven't been training as hard just cuz
I'm on the rehab program because I just
had surgery but yeah so the scale says
the same thing but the mirror says
something completely different
very much more important
yep I agree under by send your cute
we mayor me

social media like that

special and depending on the meat cut
with risk you'll actually like a
medium-rare if it's a song I like a
medium I like to dip it in the sauce
whoa I don't think it's soft look like
this I think look a look like is Korean
ponzu sauce or whatever and I dip it in
the rice and then later the rice puffs
up that sauce - if the rice becomes
flavor to eat that I you a salad I
always like to get this soy bean soup
it's like a stinky shoe but it's really
bomb it smells like fart it's pretty
bomb this delicious this ISA is
fermented

favorite meat is the tongue especially
the heart what he taught us really soft
yummy Oh what's your second favorite
second favorite spy person that's the
one right yes yes I've seen my favorite
tooth like this one is probably cause
it's marinated beef but I don't really
like Google authorship a lot of people

childhood got plenty of me

almost caught him slipping he had to
think about it for second like oh shit
really you're saying somebody else asked
me that before you so good job Nets you
know shooting a great job yeah I noticed
how mighty remove your head there you
have it before when it's long it's kind
of like we have a hood right come on
here it looks like this stuff's going on
right but then now when I just told you
all we have enough meat and you're
looking for a place to put it down right
and I know they've got a jig he needs to
like you'll be sitting there and then I
don't feel like talking evading like
yeah I'm like shit I don't realize
really a move like you look like
I never realized she moved her head
around that much that's why she cut her
hair now not as stuff like it's like I
know that before she always let her with
her bangs which is good
yeah do it get out away I do people know
- ables right now we're going to a spa
oh hi papa
hi mama bikini weasel how do you feel I
feel good why just just why cuz you just
got back from the spa I did
but I feel like somehow I got too much
soap in my eyes my eyes burning it just
dry did you get eye soap in your eye
thank you so you're not sure I think I
had soap in my eyes but then I just kept
scrubbing away and then even though I
had soap in my eyes I was like I just
get it out later you scrubbed a lot cuz
I see all this right here it's really
shiny yeah I scrubbed it why eyes are so
red I got something on oh my god did he
feel really try yeah I got him in my
eyes I just left it there for 15 minutes
why would you do that I just wanted to
finish clipping so I'll just like I
forgot burns and I'm like I just keep
scrubbing oh my god
immediately that the first thing I want
to do is just take the soap out of my
eyes
no but the Naza focused thing for me um
I didn't bring my face wash you forgot
it so there's all that this line here
this is all just makeup you didn't scrub
I know I did so you do this right but
then it just stays along the water line
yes let me scrub it with the towel no I
mean I can't put a towel like this close
to my eyeball cuz and it's gonna tells
gonna go inside my eye oh so I you have
to do your hands because then that's the
part you can control the most but then
this whole thing is like mascara still
it my
the face wash that they have just
doesn't remove so it looks crazy but it
feels so relaxed I feel really good
oh it's going to the spa I never really
liked going to this ball before just
because I don't I didn't know the small
follicles spa culture just cuz like
there's like a culture in that internet
mean like you're not suppose that like
if you walk around with like clothes on
in the bike sauna and pools area then
you're frickin weirdo but there's
there's like etiquette so I had to learn
and I watch all the Asian ladies like
they always have their little basket of
like toiletries you have your basket too
I'll take it into the way they do and
then they have the home home girl system
where one girl washes the other
or the one lady washes the other ladies
