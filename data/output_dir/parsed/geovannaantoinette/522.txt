alright it's 8 a.m. just woke up no
makeup on look like shit I get it
feeling a little bit sick but it's ok
fucking thirsty cuz I've been trying to
make weight I'm competing in a 148 class
and to ensure that I make this weight I
didn't eat or drink anything last night
so then I will go out 146 which means I
made weird and we have Brandon Sarah
Tiffany Kyle or Nadine who are all
competing they're gonna kill it
that's TIFF that's Kyle that's fucking
the bearded stud oh damn whoa ho yeah
that's Brandon and then we have Sarah
did everyone make weight
I asked if I want made weight about that
it's all good no it's all good
yeah oh you didn't mean yourself you
guys
that's all that matters though so we are
at the Anaheim Convention Center walking
to our final weigh-in destination the
moment we've all been waiting for
because I think we're all dying to have
some grub because he's dehydrated I'm
dehydrated everyone else back he's
hydrated hey did you have to cut anyway
you did yeah so we're just waiting so
that we can weigh in make way and just
fucking carb and sodium up I can't wait
to eat all the nasty shit of the world
that might nasty I mean really delicious
fatty stuff not like shit like literal
shit all right so we have bread in here
who's gonna do his very first meat ever
how you feelin Brandon what's going
through your head right now I'm really
thirsty I had to cut like a pound and a
half so I hate like 1 vo yesterday and
I've been bulking but last-minute
decision I wanted to jump to 132 s so
this whole tiny blood I've been eating
Oh for 148 yeah I'm eating for 140 for
the past week I'm slowly tapering now
I'm 32
Jarett of my effect my lips now you'll
be good yeah trainings been good I've
been really consistent I don't think I
missed a day so did she oh you know
we're talking about me here dude we're
talk about you but yeah what you're
thinking
how do you feel about um tomorrow are
you nervous excited both or none I'm
just nervous I keep replaying in my head
my name you drop I scared I'm Michael to
sink too low yeah tight and then my
first if my spots go bad and everything
I think everything that's so funny cuz I
had the exact same thought for my first
meet yeah so hopefully squats
I'm just hoping squats no good no that
is so funny I had the exact same thought
like I get up there and then something
happens where I sink it too much or it's
too heavy in every scenario in Ocoee
serious
oh I know oh sorry we have the girls
here yeah what are you doing you're
trying to lose weight how much more
about pound it's okay I'm not doing my
way waiting to weigh in but before I can
do that I have to select my Rock Heights
which is this because this is the only
rock that they have or the probably have
two racks but everyone buries in Heights
so they just adjusted according to the
lifter so Boris would be more than mine
for obvious reasons
I was wrong his legacy to the first
yeah we all had a successful weigh-in
how do you finish one everyone's eating
yeah I ate his Fritos Pedialyte don't
don't sponsor us so can you explain to
me with the purpose of drinking
Pedialyte is I so in order to make
weight the most common method is to
dehydrate yourself my water loading
water manipulation or sauna and so as
soon as you're done weigh in and you
want to rehydrate yourself and Pedialyte
a lot of electrolytes sugar and all
kinds of other shit in here to help you
retain water so that's what you have it
down this so their body can retain the
water because if you just down pure
water because you haven't been eating
anything there's no sodium to retain
this in your body just gonna pee it
right out so you need this bad boy and
then after your body gets all kinds of
electrolytes then you put this bad boy
in there so you need both bad boys oh
that's why you need flaming hot cheetos
and Fritos there's more sodium in there
why do you want all those why do you
want to learn so much it's to rehydrate
that's gonna help you retain the water
boom
don't litter finally our first meal and
it's gonna be at flapjacks never been
here before we are in the city of orange
orange
yeah
our waffles have arrived
Oh
I could take the over-medium

where are these Oh hash browns with
cheese on it

freakin imma love you for life I know I
left it open for reason just got home
everyone has that food coma everyone
wants to take a nap I'm a creep on the
minute a little bit
what's good yeah oh yeah I don't know
how they're doing it yeah but you make
it so easy
but even then nobody's closer oh yeah
what yeah like this is like a go yeah

long time but not to take a shit

really delicious
Sara was the true homie he came through
for myself with my leftovers and beat
Roy over here yeah this pardon Bart
Brandon and geo were like fighting oh my
god did he show through that for me I
don't like finding out the better table
side to say both of their nose
meet Sarah every meal
what did you really love fuckface I kind
of fucked myself because I would have
the most without anyone at the
restaurant
and I eat the least amount of food out
of anyone and I'm so full so when I came
here I looked at the menu like no it's
not happening
I don't understand why you fucked
yourself because you really didn't order
the most out of anyone
you just which I ordered the most they
came with our sausages
I wish to call this fries I'd like 1/3
of the sandwich
the kids menu huh ain't you order from
the kids menu with the little boy yeah
