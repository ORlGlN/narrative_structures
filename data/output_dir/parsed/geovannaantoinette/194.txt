the same guy but I think it is and it
seems like he's okay now actually and
I'm really happy he's crawling around he
does look kind of funny the way that he
is running which makes me think it's the
same guy because his rear legs can't
heal that fast and he's not running at
this like he's completely okay
but the fact that he is running around
makes me feel so good because this
morning woke this morning I thought he
died I saw this possum jump from 20 feet
or drop from 20 feet up on the wall
slam straight on the ground I really
thought he'd died and then when I
started to watch him crawl around I
thought he was paralyzed and all that
sucks but it seems like he's okay that's
awesome hey buddy you okay now don't run
