it looks how that should be when the
Train is going through turns because all
the doors are open and each one of their
cars is just straight but it's changed
at the doors so it looks super trippy
you see that now it's rotating this is
so cool that all the trains are just
open and you just go from one car into
the other car its longboard and Explorer
that's crazy that he can just the cars
aren't open like this maybe just go from
one car to the other one that's cool
breaker the whole key to this these are
gonna bust will don't know that's not
cute anymore this is crazy

okay
beer from my back what is this you don't
call that venture
do you guys think this bathroom has
enough toilet paper I'm not sure sure
they may have to install at least three
more just to be safe
interesting this place is interesting so
you come in here and they have cubicles
and so that people can eat in private
but they also are able to fold this so
that uh always long so that we can share
the experience but Tokyo it's common to
eat by yourself because everyone's so
busy you know how to meet up with people
so they cater that to that demographic
are by themselves and I'm really excited
because everyone especially you guys
make telling me on my idea that I have
to come here in the moment of the best
year from super fun do not do not tell
me I have my own water all my goodness
do not tell me this it is holy guacamole
I am so thirsty and I love drinking
water this is amazing to see that mother

father is slow oh my goodness sorry I
should have known I'm so peasant I don't
have to cook my own egg I should have
know that the angles already done I fuck

I'm always got to start with the broth
better than cup noodles has a little
kick to with a chill
Oh
mom is delicious song my birthday was
not the best ramen I've ever had but
just were rich enough and just delicious
enough you know work I can eat it every
single day you know sometimes get
something really rich and delicious but
you can only hit it once a month it is
so heavy this is but the things that you
can't eat everyday the kind of bland
this is like whitening love it every day
and it's it's still very flavorful
delicious so I'm gonna kill it then the
ramen was a success that was absolutely
fun and I want to end the night by
showing you how beautiful that night
line is in Tokyo look at this
the lights are so bright it's almost as
if it's daytime Wow look at the ground
