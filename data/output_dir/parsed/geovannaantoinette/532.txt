hey what's up beautiful people
so it is now the afternoon and I woke up
hello early today to get my workout in
and ended the work on a really positive
note I'm super happy you guys why don't
you got those videos I upload those
every single Wednesday but right now I'm
actually headed with fucking stupid face
and more face to the CrossFit Games
never been there first time I've ever
been there so I'm really excited to see
what the hell it's all about
the lot that they're doing is the one
with a song with the best with the best
weighted that's 100 pull-ups 200
with the weighted run and this is the
the last stretch of it that's where you
see them sprinting oh no another doing
spots
boys
so far that I know about the CrossFit
Games is that there's a fucking shit ton
of food look at this it seems like
everyone is eating something except for
us what the fuck now that I'm gonna be
dreamy real quick let me know if I'm
dreaming it ain't too much of the games
just because we were like visiting
different booths and connecting with a
lot of different people but all in all I
think the CrossFit Games we're pretty
cool I don't know what did you guys
think from a little bit that you guys
saw I never saw like actual like
big-time CrossFitters let's get against
each other usually it's always like
Instagram people or just regular
CrossFitters on a normal box I never saw
the professional athletes compete
against each other out of such a high
level so it's cool to see like how much
of the heart they pour out like there's
this girl sounds like feds over and she
had like saliva coming out of her nose
and stuff and you can see how much they
have to push and the type of town just
have to complete I'll be I'll ever do
stuff like that's too crazy
uh it made me realize next year I just
have to try hard and get to the games
while you actually do have your cert
though right but doesn't edit so when we
first came across Alex we met him he was
applying at her kid and he was he was in
the middle of getting his CrossFit what
