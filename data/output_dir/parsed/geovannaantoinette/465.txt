up up up up come on come on come on I'm
freaky
then he's talking they are
hi birdie
they should but they actually do make
them for he was all wood
is that our sleeping arrangement now you
stay there and I stay here oh pretty
like the idea hello yeah
damn dogs yeah I've gonna get one for
the office just like to sleep in there's
nothing for the dog
fun we think about that pretty
way to go that we think about that
okay
both so pretty is a big bozo bozo brig
II is a big bozo
all right at our new office it is
getting constructed now when we last
showed it to you is just as empty shell
now there is some actual frame work
happening to show what everyone's
individual office is gonna look like so
here it is
how freaking cool is this so this is to
be a kitchen it is no longer a kitchen
it is now an office or nevermind I think
about I don't know what it's gonna be
look at this
here's one office
here's another office here's another
office that's Bart can Brandon Sean and
in another office and then this will be
open area for everyone because I
personally do not work working in an
office I feel too confined and the fact
that there's windows here
I need my open space or I go glaze see
and then where David is that's actually
his office see that
all the other offices these are other
people's offices it's still in there
baby
monsterous what are you thinking I'm
thinking this is really cool that uh to
see like them put the studs up and it
really like we saw what the office looks
like in terms of on the paper like what
the layouts gonna be and on the paper it
looks pretty legit but I still can
really envision is just going based off
the measurements y'all think well you
know like this much working for a room
looks like it's gonna really well but
not this year
just erected just kind of see what that
boundaries are
how do you feel about having barbell
inside the same spaces JK I'm really
excited just because
to be able to bounce back to before
slow this is gonna make things way
easier marbles in meeting its own
corporate office for the longest time so
now that we have our own corporate
office and not just our design office
but also our sake section and corner I
think it's really gonna help our brigade
grow and it's like the centerpiece I
think for a lot of the guys in the
entrepreneurial environment can grow and
flourish but a lot of them are bald guys
we're still running out of our home and
they know they can't really see where
the trajectories but every time you have
more and more of a physical
manifestation of what success looks like
for people that haven't been through
that grind they can see they can see the
company growing in it and it builds
motivation and helps them grow a lot
more
not just for the workflow before the
morale booster
I really agree with everything you just
said cyber smiling during that day it
was actually
if you read them into the apartment
desmos through the fact that their
computer show you the same workspace ask
me like I've seen the growth and have
seen the potential from starting from
zero
Oh
whatever we're gonna break the table
doing all right David let me get some
better sunlight
all right how do you feel about this
whole move it's pretty interesting
there's other people there
I think the places
a person I've seen even bigger
there's still space over respective but
it's a pretty big move for a lot of
people my guess for you specifically
because I know you've had like several
offices that weren't really offices I
know you had one on top of barbell and
then that was didn't work out and then
after that doesn't have any other
offices besides I get home
oh but that wasn't really an office that
was in space right like you move yeah I
think also because for me like a noise
so like and I almost someone gets very
fidgety son I don't think
from there I bounced to another place
I'm
being in the same place but the great
thing about this is I also see have this
face and you have that space and you
have that space and you have the body
action system we're gonna break your
camera these strikes in the vagina why
do you hate me so much before the most
successful and attracted me to be you
can't be a bitch John Jay can you okay
all that time I really believe that no I
really believe in my goal part
your hand if you guys ever broke up they
killed myself so only because you said
we would break up cuz I would cheat on
him because I have to say that I met him
first before you I've technically known
him a whole day before I knew you
