try to live a good time so we just
wrapped an amazing shoot with this
awesome vintage car it's like a 1962
yes look at that it is cherry it is
width of white
okay okay so it's like another busy
music video but one is just gonna blow
your socks off rui we had a button in
shorts and bikinis
doing their strut their stuff for you
and right now we are gonna
return the car take the car back and
core part isn't working so hard at this
stupid car pi three cars crazy cuz so
what the guy told me is like there's
plenty of power steering there's no
power brakes so what that means is well
the modern cars are they have that whole
up four wheel disc brake things this car
doesn't happen so if you look at my feet
you have to drive the two feet we need
one on the gas and you need a left foot
on the brake so you can smash
and you really really get a thigh
workout driving this car
for him yeah he's been doing through
this all day week we live in Monterey
Park and the car was located in north
hollywood west yeah located in west
hollywood so yeah i was taking on in my
drawers all all the way back home and
now I'm shaking in my drawers and in my
boots point all the way back to his
place so we have to return a mint
condition because we did this little
trade-off where he lets us his car if I
leave him my car so I bought my car back
so hopefully we make all in one piece
you
