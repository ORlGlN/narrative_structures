c'mere oh you could figure it out no
hope you come here Hopi you could figure
it out oh my god no we had a special
guest today
Hopi Park Hobie hey she's uh she's not
really trekking your macros right now
she's on a bulk are you on a bulk Hopi
oh she's embarrassed she doesn't want to
talk about it I like her pause though
yeah
if cute little pause she has a nice coat
so check us out we are all working right
now
this is our job okay this is what we
have to do for work
so trust me we're all working I swear
we're working
see he's working over there
Joe Kennedy
because she's working he wants to save
it for the camera he's just watching
everyone I think he's in email
all right
this one
no teeth
my job is so fun so this has to be one
of my favorite parts is definitely this
isn't actually the old bank district
another one of my favorites is actually
the theater room but I freakin do not
remember looking this developed I think
within the last six months they've
developed it so much I really don't even
recognize this place because most of the
buildings you select similar to the
hotel Barclay over there where
everything was rundown and dilapidated
and just really sad and there were like
a bunch of bums everywhere downtown is
actually notorious for the homeless the
homeless or the homeless so it's really
cool that they're kind of like for you
to pay everything it's really nice to
see it's happening all right so we took
a nice little walk through downtown LA
what part about what District business
I don't know it's downtown downtown
though yeah so we're in downtown town
tonight not necessarily financial
district I don't know
this is wallop all buildings are we're
just we're all that tall buildings are
and we're at this place called semi
sweets bakery and I'm actually really
happy that would here right now because
I don't know how long I've had this or
where I got this from but I have this
habit of needing and wanting and craving
something sweet as soon as I finish my
main meal so the main usually is gonna
be savory but once that meal is done I
have to have something together sweet
gum or gummy bear candy something so
right now that we're here getting
pastries I'm so excited because this is
yummy bakery but I didn't even hear oh I
don't even know existed and it's going
crazy she has a tiny object fixation
look at this
yeah anytime she sees something smart we
see something small she goes wait more
bananas than I do I think if you just
fucking on like potion but she goes oh
it doesn't matter what's happening she
could be shot in the leg and if she sees
it she's gonna be like limb beach bag
yeah we're still working
and Brendan hates sweets hates God why
would how can you hate sweeps oh my god
oh that's funny
he's a bit of man so you got some bitter
ass black coffee with no sugar no milk
no sweetener nothing so bitter so poppy
yes what does it feel like being
outdoors and walking in your home
it's like this feeling that feels so
cool because la is such a legendary city
and we have all these skyscrapers and
it's like a hustling bustling city in a
extremely urban environment and
every time I'm down here I'm walking
around I'm like why don't I come down
here more this is in my backyard and
when I'm back in like suburban area then
I'm like oh shoot I'm too busy or I'm
too caught up in my normal life but
being out here makes me want to come out
here more often because a lot of people
come out here to just hang out or people
come on vacation they just stop by here
and they want to check out all the local
spots around here and I have access to
all these things but I don't take the
time to smell the flowers we kind of
take you for granted a little bit I mean
for me at least I absolutely enjoy this
because I feel like when I walk to
places I actually get to look and stop
and like what you said smell the roses
because when I'm driving on my all that
physical physical but it's like me
glancing at it for like three seconds
and then out of sight out of mind
I don't think about it anymore no you
know how many movies are shot in
downtown fucking his shits and shit
that's even shot suppose it that or that
they try to make it seem like it's in
New York these shooters yeah they shot a
lot of fat man see yeah so there's like
there's so much rich culture here that
we just kind of take it for granted yeah
and every time I walk down here
and I should take advantage of more of
what I have at home yeah I mean I think
another thing that kind of not
necessarily turns me off about it but I
think something that just doesn't make
me want to come here more often
one markets one the parking is just
horrendous like there's no parking ever
but I feel like that might be all down
yeah but second and I guess one of the
most important ones is that a lot of
these places are a lot of these areas
are getting redeveloped you're um so
there's like a mixture of like really
cool shops opening up but then you still
have like the homelessness and the bumps
and stuff and some areas that just don't
seem like
that they're the safest
we are here with about 80% of the JK
crew and I think they're gonna see the
office for the first time and are you
super excited to show everyone and you
like is it like a new home so you're
like check out your new I'm super
excited because me John Michael went
through a lot to lock this place down
and these are our two finalized spaces
so here a fabulous
which least made the most sense and now
that we have it I know everyone's been
anticipating so I know everyone's really
excited to see the news face
I'm excited to show everyone and get
everyone's reactions how are you going
to show everyone have keys they're just
gonna have to peek they have to be
peeping toms are lovely yeah this would
be funny this will be awesome it'll be
really quick I'm sure you guys will
never know where it is watch I'm sure is
gonna be some of you fans like oh my god
my dad works there I know exactly what
they did
I'm gonna fuck the team you can just
edit that last part
why to pee ha
one of our speed life
the offset this is the set
everyone's doing the peeping toms Tom is
doing the peeping tom it's just this
this and this
the shape is weird on that one
I saw like a party process
worship my barber corner
right there right next to that truck
your barber Corner leave all the hair on
the floor birds can build the nest
leave it to our crew to touch it there
know how they'd bring something welcome
to the inside so we haven't built
anything yet this is where the admin
area would be this is the admin office
and we're actually planning on building
offices throughout the whole thing so
there'd be offices this whole row that
whole area where Julia is actually gonna
be open space because we want to take
advantage of the windows cuz I
personally love natural lighting so I
want to make sure and and I need to work
out that I can't be in an office I can't
be in a box and be created I feel like
I'm trapped in this area here this that
would be all the barbell and I think
David so is gonna have a office here -
there's gonna be a pretty sweet fucking
office with all our family and friends
and we're gonna get to collaborate on
projects and work together and just feed
off of each other's energy it's gonna be
awesome
it's a I can't wait everything can't
wait look at Brandon
everyone's like a kid at a candy store
right now they're so excited so better
than you guys got the sneak peek of our
office oh I forgot to mention there's
like a kitchen a little kitchen area
here and then a bathroom there
and then this would be the front the
main entrance and then right across the
way you can see like a dark building
that would also be ours
and that's where all our sets are going
to be so Oh Brandon
that's why our sets are gonna be so then
anytime we're filming we're not
interrupting anybody that's doing any
sort of admin work or just office work
or meetings
