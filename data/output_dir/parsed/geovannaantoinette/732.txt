woke up this morning redness in my eyes
really dry so glad that Taiwan has sting
I'll ocean hell yeah patching the tour
bus to scope out the ins and outs of
Taiwan look at the decorations
look at the windows
why do we need the window dressing like
this why here we have freedom plaza this
thing is huge you should look it up what
history's pretty damned oh just arrived
at one of the tallest buildings in the
world it was once the number one tall
this building now it's not number one
but called the 101 because yes
so it was actually modeled after bamboo
because in type 1 there's a lot of
typhoons so it's it's really difficult
for a building of this size to actually
withstand the strain uous weather so
they modeled it after it so that it can
hold all that stuff and it also holds
the record for being the having the
fastest elevator going up there only 22
36 seconds not minutes 36 seconds to get
to the very top check you actually
raining right now which is the norm in
today this time it rains this is a year
but look we're on eating so we're eating

detail of this table his team was so
awesome and then these chairs
should go inside the table so
