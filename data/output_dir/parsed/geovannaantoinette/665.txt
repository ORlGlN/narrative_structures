so should either Lydia
full and when you have the clear sight
on the gun what you want to do is the
front side right on the target you want
your eyes focus once clear and you want
your target to be blurry so for you film
heads up to putting out of focus or
whatever you don't want to focus on the
target then your sights are off sites to
be clear target Lurie but with your
peripheral vision you can see that the
clear target is on the clear sights were
on it and then that's when you put all
that together and all that shooting
we're just talking guns
move or I purposely want light or feet
away from you
