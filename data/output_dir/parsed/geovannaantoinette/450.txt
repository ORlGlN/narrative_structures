that's it know that sometimes they put
other stuff in there like avocado
cucumber who are you just really have
your okay to make racist jokes

people with a really genius idea kinda
genius ideas

walking the strip Pattinson forever
so I just have it to us right now we're
playing craps which we never play we
watch so we just learned from lacrosse
thanks to thanks to be child hot streak
he was all of us we're coming up on
honey
and our the whole table is waiting
people that even know him was going
across and getting it free money so they
can keep his luck up and just keep the
morale up and then uh we're all up we
all we all pulled out we had a strong
pull out game as fast as that sounds
that sexual term pulling it all at the
same time with teamwork yep so now we're
walking the strip walking by Bellagio
so many people miss Bellagio this is
where the where that water show happens
every night
but what's crazy is that even though
we're in Vegas we're all still working
that's why B Troy has the camera and the
monopod in his backpack and I'm vlogging
there we go
that was pretty fucking terrifying
honestly that was terrifying his fog I
never want to see that ever again it was
what Exorcist shit my shit actually
breaks
he's levitating
that is so cool better seen it in person
that is so cool
that's magic guys I know I don't know I
I do believe in magic but I just I just
hate that people have the mess of that
illusion of that magic really exists
I like pretending it as you love I love
magic I know like it's not physically
possible like doesn't physics like
physically possible but I like I enjoyed
being a kid again and just like enjoying
how they're able to pull out these
optical illusions and I think it's
really fun the mine fuckery of it all
cuz I'm just like how do they do it
David Blaine was one of my ultimate
favorite ones she would write shit down
and then he's like throw it against a
glass window and then it's embedded
within the window and I'm like how do
they do shit like that yeah I like that
I wanna meet ya
are we going whole Planet Hollywood
tripping it's just fun I never walk this
trip and I think I think I don't like
walking this trip just because I don't
like these long people right now it's
like that how or that family ours so
cause it's only seven o'clock the still
family time kids are so out everyone's
not plastered so it's like enjoyable
ironically the plaster time is like
actually like midday I mean there's a
lot of people that come by on vacation
and so because our on you're on vacation
as soon as I wake up on a drink during
like 2:00 p.m. noon just a bunch of
class or people are a I think those guys
are worn out so now it's the family
people coming out and I think what they
recover that the plastic people come out
again yeah yeah yeah alright let's see
