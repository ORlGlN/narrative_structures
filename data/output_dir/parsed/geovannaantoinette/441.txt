was in the other
sorry today a middle of that melody roll
is not in a good condition
no but do you know how to say good
morning in Japanese thank you
I always ms people at parties Ohio
sounds like this enemy then that they
said oh hi Ohio and when you put coal
diamonds to the end
oh hi yoga's Emmett it's a polite way to
say so
so among friends we just say Ohio we
about somebody like that we say Ohio
cause I must to be polite with Ed
because I must say konnichiwa konnichiwa
a goodbye sayonara sayonara and then
hard to say thank you in Japanese thank
you thank you and again the important
part is arigato arigato and if you put
gozaimasu to the end it's a polite way
to say so I think I Togo time and tell
it applies to swear don't more I think I
talked about that thank you very much in
this but the world arigato is enough
please remember the word I think I've
done here and the what are they got
those sounds like an English word i DJ
the doesn't it so if you forget say of
course in the mumbling when you get a
good time
it's right there if you look carefully
right there Ernest
look right there no it's right there
look look look carefully see it right
I was it I know that trick of the tour
you know every like station they go okay
that's a part of my Fuji that's the part
of a Fuji the trick is to put all the
parts together in imagination to the
side Wow the copy of the fun is out here
that's nice
this is like the Big Bear of Japan it's
like the countryside there's a vet or
grandma walking
I love you we're gonna eat now I like
about white Peters we're a fancy
establishment

cool stores and desolate but it's very
beautiful
pulling away from the beautiful scenery

tantrum just because oh my God look at

because of the gondolas
What's Wrong David I just don't I just
don't think that I should be doing this
who's popular I don't take a picture
before you doom why are we doing this
because we paid for it finally we need
to do something evidence to show this to
learn I was told that it was too rainy
and cold for us to do this I don't think
people realize exactly legitimate fear
of Isis people say they're scared of
heights they they get nervous I am
afraid of dying
I gotta be the truth I gotta be any with
you
David is scared because I have a deathly
fear my David is that their God looks
stable look at all the children in there
and that's how done they are because
they're young we have an experience like
their I have experience he's happy
though good point is here or are you
this scared but you're good because
and what's the auction event
good
oh happy day oh happy day oh happy day
all up in human ass come on maybe what
died on this thing it all speak no
English

nobody shit my way
let's go into nothing right now he looks
like already done look I'm scared don't
worry there's only a lot of tires on
this shit about guys there's big metal
wires there's no wire that's the only
one thing that's holding us up it's so
beautiful
could open up that I could open that too
usually when they get scary I try to
think of a safety protocol so imagine if
the wire that's not what would you do
the first thing I do is I think about
Mike miners in that one movie where they
were both falling off the building and
they grab the person in front though
that you're going first
yeah well gravity works against you full
we're gonna turn around I'm gonna let it
I'm gonna look
I'm using them as what what you make it
something I got double G's snowboarding
is my favorite part but because of our
tour being so shit today that this is
pre exciting this is like being stuck in
a bus but now we're stuck in a gondola
and it's mother okay so today we won't
be doing usually you know going to the
lake but today because of the way there
is not permit usually there's so much
money falling from the sky usually this
attachment is a spaceship let us know

it's like a stamping station like you
collect them from different places that
you've been to and this is one of the
stops I don't have anywhere to stamp it
boo how cute this is how classy Japan is
so they leave this out in the open for
the public so you see this right and
it's just right out in the public anyone
has access to it and essentially I mean
me just putting two and two together not
knowing what the fuck but I feel like
you either put best wishes or things
that you want Santa maybe to bring you
so you get one of these guys and it
should be blank on one of the sides let
me see

feel like you write what you want for

understand and empathize with different
cultures and be more sensitive it really
is an amazing feeling please guys highly
regular traveling
but anyway single Oh sacred
this is the nine headed dragon gun users
awesome franchises Johto Longson after
one of the beauties of of knowing
chinese is that with chinese you can
read a lot of japanese the kanji and you
could read a lot of old-school korean
because they all share the same language
oh that's amazing attention of the god
I think reenacting the service was
permanently
what do you said that sounds amazing I
sound cool I want to go this way oh I
love this
oh here's the
the nine headed dragon
yeah
oh this is a purifying tip same thing so
what I learned about traditional Shinto
temples is that in the front there's
always two partying docks there's one
here if you notice this guy's mouth is
open and then that guy's not this closed
so he's open the sound that you make is
those are the beginning and the ending
alphabet of the Sanskrit alphabet which
is like the OG from my India a long time
ago and that kind of represents the
beginning and the end which is like
Alpha and Omega and everything comes
together Oh sick that's amazing I want
to see the other one sorry that's a
tongue shot oh and this one has the
mouth closed
great story look at how beautiful this
is

acknowledged Japanese and then look the
electricity from here Japanese all right
I got you

people so so you know what the root of
all evil is mobile devices selfie sticks

great town yeah but there is from he
obviously I cannot wait to last millions
at least anything else I took a great
hub of my mom would work to sounder
Cisco

photo class and it's better than a plane
that's still not as Isis
like pull it down all the way and then
immediate or the train to be built from
LA to San Francisco but they're trying
to throw the whole dollar anyway I

this whether I was doing wonders for
your curly hair I don't love it it's the
most cutest curly hair in the first year
because on the sides it's really
straight but on top it's very voluminous
my hair is doing that to me I have leave
me here like he does I think he's maybe
a little there but humidity at he was
making it cold but I think it's gone off
the head you feel my curly hair struggle
early her struggles half-second early
her striking the car clubs
right
anyway she's are Donkers
I thought it was bad to eat in public
because it's really sloppy right
the chain since I wanted to
warmer
when it's cold yeah I said my grace
like ponies with her
it was Brandon you
we had to know
we got split up because there wasn't
enough seats for everyone sitting
part
hold on music Domino is purple
No
there it is
I grabbed it you wouldn't have me I'm
sorry anyway so yeah we got split up and
we were gonna start looking for them but
apparently they went down without us so
they gave us no heads-up we were reduced
our panicking stop running into the
courts
maybe we fell asleep but they were going
to take off again but all is well
nobody's missing everyone's back
together again
this is my favorite part of what we
learned in
everyone they're so courteous it's like
I was like everyone gets it the
escalator etiquette everyone stands to
the left so that this side is all the
speedway
I love this everyone's so thoughtful
except for this guy no class hey China
guy
yeah
I love this
I think the people and the when we
walked in I think we were so loud that
there was like this old grandpa he's
getting so pissed at us
use it
we need to move yeah we're getting in
people's way what's the plan
we're trying to figure out after time
about mall we're gonna eat one every
single which breezy about Japan is
because they're so limited with space
are things really small so unfortunately
they can't really key to serve people
like us which we are assisting people
most of the restaurants that I have seen
here to a max of like ten people and
that's like pretty big
they're taking professional besides two
one good one
which is this one
