our last day today and we're going to
try to find some shops and we're not
sure where we're going
waiting for them all back hi good yeah
sources we're staying at the Caesars
they have a lot of really good shops
here called the forum and we've been
trying to shop but the whole crew has
been wanting it like either gamble or
just hanging out and of course hang out
with the crew and bonding is definitely
priority so now that it's our last day
everyone's kind of sleeping they need to
pack we're kind of on our own program
right now so we're finally gonna check
it out
all right so we're here the forum shops
and check out the sky it's so beautiful
it's a really good job
it does is this like all real marble
pass up so much detail but if you wanted
to just wanted us to stand here and just
like stare I'd like to call them and
they're beautiful and they're like the
art that's paint it on there like the
bouquet of flowers and fruits and then
even like the liver whatever they call a
quarter files or something oh yeah yeah
down here there's so much to absorb but
I think people just take that with you
forever like this every statue is
different at every corner
I think if I did Vegas by myself I'd
probably just walk I just stare do you
see what that looks like
well done don't move
that looks funny
okay you can come back
yeah it's beautiful for sure there's a
lot of stuff you just imagine what the
real shit looks like or would look like
when they like first made it
what's craziness I think that puts so
much heart into it but people come here
for their own own agenda they snip a lot
of beautiful
yeah look at like the side pillar here
honestly can I be honest with you but
I've never even looked at all these
details until you pointed it out right
now yes I always always come with a
group of people and they always have
something to do like you said in at
Renda so I've never looked at I've never
just stood here because we were always
late to something or how'd it go
somewhere you know how like did this
always say like every every time you
looks at me I'm off doing something
weird or look at something yeah that's
what I'm looking at - I just see all
this stuff
bushfire
see imagine was like this like that
normally is made we put a lot of thought
into the little bevel besides
maybe alright
this is one of my favorite parts here
because they made the sky look real like
if you stare at it long enough you swear
that this is funny you swear that the
clouds are moving
it's beautiful
no it's not
oh my god fine
what are we doing so more so than
shopping me and Geo we actually like to
look
displease what the hell disgusting you
liked we like to look at the displays we
like to look at the displays of stores
because there's there's craftsmanship
and there's art behind the display
you can have oh man whatever shirt but
at the displays though now the sure
let's teletype especially shoe stores
you know I get to be a whatever shoe and
this place though or you have a dope-ass
shoe but this place sucks now the shoes
we look that way we came to this you're
glowing might decide very iconic we
always have a glowing orange Nike Cylon
almost every single store
actually bleachers so they built
bleachers into it's justwhat old school
bleachers and that's the pattern behind
it very cool look at this they're not
bigoted stay there these are all
bleachers this place from the bottom and
then it's a Nike swoosh is lit from
behind but they're all bleachers good I
Tyga have the lights a lot of people
like when they build this place they
completely forget about the light aspect
but the light at the bottom it also adds
luminescence onto the bleachers so it's
not just one blown out piece and same
thing from the top so it'll look like
there's spots of light and it gives it
like this mysterious feel but the true
light source comes from the Nike and
then the backlit of white light
and the reason why we know all these
things is currently we're also trying to
build out the Barthel poor gates that
east and so all of this stuff really
interesting
all right just finished shopping popped
a couple things from Nike this hoodie
right here these pants right here and
these
when it's real quick real work where is
it
there it is a huge fan of planets and I
love home from people they are so I
wanted a different colorway I wanted a
new black but now we are at a
restaurants about to grub before we
catch our flights thank you
we have the helmet leave the papa bear
part
overall how was your Vegas experience it
was too short really I feel like I was
here for too long
one spot
it's chilly
massages
shocking day and I wanted
oh yeah
I want to shooting
you counti the same two fingers
I really wanted we better get this time
we really wanted to get this dialogue at
MGM but it was just so quick this
weekend this
but if something is still cool that we
got a sweet Network doctor
the main purpose of the trip
to accomplish everything else is just
kind of bullshit and like this luxuries
you know the next time we're showing it
B Troy how was your experience here
okay so you're not really happy with
this trip drama happy I thought that
they're together
that we experienced
Vegas
everybody
actually I was on fire I could
bully on
that table was so salted man the vibes
are so bad any minimum was ten bucks
that's it
I thought you loved me
just kidding
for me since I'm not a big fan of Vegas
honestly you know this I know but
well fortunately I'm not a big fan of
everything is about that's just not my
style Coulter fiber food no drink
Maggie's not but what I did love and I
especially love this trip was what the
guys already
like Pierre DeVaughn and we bonded
fortunately again
stuff or Jinky news too often just
because we all work different jobs I
never get to see them so it was really
cool to talk to them one of them
a lot of fun which in the middle
because I just remembered that Brian
let's discrete in this suite I said that
I would bring it for him so that's why I
kind of stumbled across borders
oh shit I didn't bring it with me so I
anyway yes but I could hold off for a
while to come back
I have no brush what you know
I loved caution it was mine boy how was
amazing don't be short but that's not
all that Vegas is about that's no but
that's completely
music
there's
all my battery's gonna dive Oh my
battery's down Oh Oh what's going on oh
my batteries
lucky
last meal in Vegas
you take a sip of your drink no no the
other drug the manly one no the manly
one that's the man they would like a big
ass baby

whole thing at once you're Savage
hey so I'm back home but we landed so we
flew out or I though we flew out of LAX
as you guys saw and then now we've
landed in Burbank but guess what
we landed in Burbank but I left my
freaking car in Le axe so I'm in LAX
right now even though we landed in
Burbank and this is hilarious because I
didn't realize that that had happened
until I didn't realize that had happened
until I was like oh oh yeah the picking
up status feature don't worry about that
cuz that's when we met it would be true
yeah our cars at and then I spot myself
I'm like fuck my cars at LAX so here's
the para mobile see it right behind me
at LAX what are your thoughts what are
your thoughts we all kind of just missed
everything we weren't where which is
pretty good about double-checking we
asked to travel up but this is just one
of those who are you
one flight not even cancel a half of a
flight which we don't do and very
arranged it and so we always thought
that departure would be the same but
this is funny
oh well so we had to catch an uber and
we were with this like really fancy
Armenian guy it was so slick his cool
glasses

like an hour to get here but it was a
Musil but it was it was under media
