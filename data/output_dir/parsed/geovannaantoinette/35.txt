hey guys so today's gonna be a really
cool day cuz we're gonna do something
really really fun something I've never
done before and it's this thing called
happy place what it is exactly I don't
know but they promised to make me happy
so I'm excited to see how happy they
could make me but the unfortunate thing
is that it is in downtown LA and for us
downtown LA means no parking so we've
been driving around forever trying to
find parking
I think it's been what like 10 minutes
that we be trying to park yeah just
driving in the circle tips is that off
of 6th Street
so Tiffany's are gonna be here which is
gonna be really cool and they found
parking they're already inside they said
off of 6th Street there's a parking lot
on the other side of the block I don't
know the rules I think that's just
loading and unloading zone I know look
at this there's zero parking and you
think there's a parking spot but then
it's like really tiny or people just
don't park or their movie or they don't
park correctly or if they are park
correctly they move in a different size
car comes in and then it messes up the
spacing so we're still Jeff know we've
been driving around for 20 minutes and I
think we're about like 7 blocks away no
but we find parking here I think we're
just enough to walk and that's cool
walking shoes I got my my what is this
velvet yeah suede velvet I got my velvet
skates on and if you know me you know I
love me a good pair of skates my my high
skates I have some friendship on and I
got these and I got a different set of
printed ones but dang we're still joking
around
so I don't hopefully find a spot soon
and then
I can get happy cuz right now I'm not
happy are you happy
oh fuck well I take a lot to be happy
I'm so Moody
look at that rack ooh what is that rat
squirrel I'm gonna cool this downtown
spots look there's so many like hidden
gems everywhere there's hos let's see

spots toy factory I want to go to a toy
factory it's lost now it used to be a
historical twister oh so that's just
