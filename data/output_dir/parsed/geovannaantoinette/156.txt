because you don't have to plug it in but
if you don't do any work it doesn't do
anything it's just wheel with a bunch of
fans on it you're working against air
kind of like you're moving through this
hole is really hard so the harder you
push the more goes against the air and
the harder it becomes

do get switched so because it's so bland
and flavor cause it's just corn flakes
granola across clusters almond and like
