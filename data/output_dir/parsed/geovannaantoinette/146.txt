at least locally to me yeah um and then
I see this with my oh shit and you
wanted to walk in here I'm like am I
really a big fan of an armor just don't
see anything that I like and then I walk
in and look at all the ghosts of home
like I would wear like 90% of the top it
fits really good yeah I was just going
to I never saw Under Armour store and
then when I came in here I'm all cool
well first of all I love Steph Curry one
of the most one of the best basketball
players right now and then there's the
rock who doesn't like the rock and then
I see misty Copeland over there the bus
