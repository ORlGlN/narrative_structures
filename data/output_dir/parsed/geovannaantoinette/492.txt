good day everybody today is actually a
pretty exciting day and kind of a new
occurrence something we used to do in
the past but once we got really busy
unfortunately this is one of the first
things to stop and that is family doggie
time and every weekend prior to us
getting busy we would always take our
dogs out we would make it a point to
take our dogs out and let them be one
with nature so if that was the beach or
if it was a dog park it was a hike we
made sure that we made it a point that
we would take our pups out so now we are
bringing that back and today's the
beginning of that and we're actually
going to go to the dog beach and this
one's really cool because the dogs get
to be off of holy SH and this guy
doesn't have to be on his leash oh my
goodness what a schmuck yeah so I'm
super excited because I don't think I've
ever taken brigh e to any sort of beach
environment I think she's actually felt
sand I'm not too sure and I know she's
seen water and has walked and like been
in water but I'm not too sure if she's
had the beach experience so I'm super
excited to take her there and see how
she's gonna interact with other people
with other animals and how she's gonna
react and act towards just being off a
leash away from us so hopefully she
comes back and hopefully I can end this
vlog with yay I have my dogs back and
she doesn't run away with someone else
oh yeah where are we we're dog Beach
this is the other little pup aru's
running around everywhere without a
breach it is the coalition ever these
guys are just so excited see this place
it look at them come on fine it's time
to be sniffing around piss time again
the water I don't even know if you're
gonna get in the water to be honest look
at those guys every time I see these
dogs fetch and do these really cool
tricks or jump in the water I feel like
that dang it as an owner I haven't
invested in much time in my dog to teach
him anything you are exposed to anything
really fun because now I can't even play
with them like now we're just gonna
watch them run around and play with
other things and animals and we're not
gonna have any part of that
all right get them off the leash

honey that's why you're the comedian in
the village shit ready go
Briggs go home yeah huh loser all right
papa we're about wrapping it up how was
your experience with the babies I really
liked
I really enjoyed today because I love
swimming and I used to swim all the time
and beaches lakes rivers all kinds of
stuff and Icicle camping a lot with
Tyson and I taught him how to swim well
dogs know how to swim on their own but
they need to learn how to overcome fear
and enjoy jumping into the water on
their own so I taught Tyson how to
overcome that fear and then when I
brought him next to swimming pools like
you would just start walking in on his
own and it really enjoyed it so I'm
trying to teach bringing and fawn that
enjoyment of swimming because I really
enjoy just swimming on in the deep end
and having them swim with me it's like a
different type of bonding than just
walking and today was their first lesson
and they both did really good I'm really
proud of you guys back there they
trusted me and because sometimes you'll
bring dogs out and for some reason like
even though you're holding I mean you
keep telling I got you I got you know
petting them they're still freaking out
but for them when when they start
panicking I would hold them and I think
when they felt my heartbeat next to
theirs and I would pet them then they
would calm down and they would start
freaking out oh my god yeah I got you
and our pet them and they did really
really good for their first swim lesson
I'm really happy
how many more swim lessons are they
gonna have hopefully at least once
hopefully at least one a month if not
every week or every other week
and we still got a couple weeks until
summer is over so the water is going to
be warm for a while so hopefully could
take advantage of that and continue the
swim lessons and Carelli really love
swimming with the family because we're
really awesome approach that Bart took
for it's the type of person to not on
cue like slowly push you into the
direction that he knows is going to be
to your advantage but then there gets to
a point where he just like has enough
he's like okay you're not even trying to
push yourself to experience new things
so then he takes matters into his own
hands and he's the type of person that
he just jumps in head to toe there's
some of us that likes to stick our toe
in the water and we're like okay I'm let
me just take my time but he's just like
I've had enough I'm pushing you in there
so that's basically what he did with the
pups he just like grabbed them threw him
in there and I was really happy that he
did that approach because for me I just
I felt like it just deemed the quickest
fastest results and I was watching it
him like all men you can see like ponts
pause like spread open because she's
just like I don't know what to do I'd be
ballads and her tail was going bananas
but it was really cool and then once she
got out of the water she was so happy to
see me and then she jumps on me in and
she gives me this she gave me this guy
right here she was so happy to see me so
slowly yeah she got you good that one
and then she gave me this right here and
then she got even more excited and then
gave me this right here yeah a lot of
excitement happening today from the pups
and they're in their kennel now can you
change it tire there it there de new
though the reason we got it kennel is
cuz they shed a lot and they're sliding
all over the place and the fact that
fawni has been kettle trained and that's
where she feels the most comfortable
safe and secure so it only made sense to
put them in a good spot and first not
have to clean fur all the damn time
and we transported
of people in this car on a weekly so we
don't want to get frog everyone's nice
clothes before they have to shake like
Jacob Melvin last yep
having thinner now wait wait having
breakfast lunch and maybe dinner
no just breakfast and lunch we're gonna
have another meal
I'm starving
it was the first meal of the day
and we are at Lala's and Melrose and
this is an Argentine grill so I'm
so starving and having anything all day
so because I haven't eaten anything all
day they're so awesome to being you this
bread and some chimichurri sauce right
here just gone
we're just gone and then this is our
second second serving of bread and I'm
so hungry imports like you can have to
stop eating this truck and eat your food
six o'clock six o'clock and it's our
first meal I am sorry we we really
wanted to dedicate the day to our pub
pups
so we're like oh we gotta get as much
done as we can for the dogs but the
company had their funding not
now it's time time
who's that guy Oh
this morning Bell my friend
it's weird though it's like a human
potato head
savage an appetizer came in and these
were called Moyes I want the waitress
basically said it's just as it's an
authority
and it's this part of a cow
listen to me
tastes like chicken
Oh No
oh no I'm scared now
that's right
is fucked up
it tastes like world
but like Fifi yeah that's not a bad
that's interesting no idea
I feel like I don't know if I could just
eat it that way it is of like I need
some like some sort of seasoning or like
something I'll try that but I feel like
I need some sort of seasoning my by
itself is kind of weird to me the
flavors it's too strange to the point
where I don't even know what to do with
it yeah take it to go
yeah the pups are gonna eat it yeah
that's the flavor I don't like
finally the moment we've all been
waiting for got my Rice's
they gotta look like rice
one of my favorites
all the time
the moment you've been waiting for
okay and I got my Rice's my mashed
potatoes and my meat this is
the moment I've been waiting for what it
is the moment I've been waiting for
driving back home it's a Saturday
and normally Saturdays mean people stand
home with your family away from any sort
of freeway but nope not in LA everyone's
out and about I guess just like us doing
this thing a thing it's really dark
