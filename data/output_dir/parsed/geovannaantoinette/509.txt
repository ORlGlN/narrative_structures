cameras facing you and I said all that

my mother she spent a lot of time
prepping for this wedding and she's been
prepping for like the past month she
booked both places both the houses for
JK and barbell people and in the houses
for our parents and family and she
worked with one of our friends over
there Nancy and she coordinated all the
catering what we're gonna eat she
ordered the shuttle buses for us to take
this to the airport rented the cars she
did everything all by herself
so in her mind it's more of a logistical
thing and she's she's she's not going to
be completely happy and able to let go
until everything run smoothly and I'm
super appreciative of mama bear no

Hema
huh
hey mom all right
come on Bruno Mars
I can't get away
in case and how's the flight was smooth
huh super smooth at all sitting for like
two minutes I think like right here like
yeah
back in LA something's wrong but playing
the mechanics you're trying to work on
it there even instead of they're like oh
sure what's gonna happen so they're
taking everything out of that bitch all
our person on it so we're back in the
lobby I think it's a sign
that we're never gonna fly Allegiant
ever every time we do a legion we always
vow to never fly allegic is something
always happens but then the prices I
sell are so good that we can't resist
like that yonder cut that yawn
the prices are unbeatable
less than average air air airplane your
airline their fare airfare and wait you
have three additional hours
his friend
No
you already spent too much time with me
when I was a baby right here
you married
right
and replaceable
yeah
hi
No
Hema
mm-hm
the community
Oh start all over function John
in
I say the that geo mamasan
until they disappear and then
in turn introduced it's a deal so full
but he's a poet
you have the polite miss manga senior no
it's my way okay okay
pretty in you
then they will
Presidium
okay yeah remember
are you
Oh
our mom's going that round two on so now
let me do it right
Bruno Mars
so we just got news that our next flight
is going to be at 4:30 p.m. and what
sucks about that is now when we land all
the car rental places are going to be
closed and we need our cars because
we're going to DPI like 30 people so one
little complication can cause a huge
aftermath and I think Jill was on the
phone out on us where everything away
she's the true MVP coordinating with
people on the ground in Hawaii trying to
figure out if someone else can pick up
the cars for us so even though if we
land late we're not house out of course
we need cars we're back on the plan
again this is the second time and
hopefully this is the real time and we
don't have to get back off the plane
but it is a legion style to get off the
plane so I don't know
what do you think babe I think
I have to be a little bit
do you think we have to get off of
course
this times for reals
prepared for the park para call forward
mom bear yeah we made it
I know how people are actually clapping
all right so how is that journey
horrible never again never again tell me
about it
so I don't know this is an expectation
that you're supposed to leave out this
line and that every time we do it we're
always late there's always a deal and
it's always something that happens and
then it kills us then the space that you
sit in an extra cramp the seats of the
client course we're here coffee
I
the whole crew right here everyone made
it you got like 5,000 people Tony touch
they're rolling deep
ah
Oh
and if the mother was here she would
either dare cross the scripture but
because I am her grandma chose me not
the reason why I do this i won
her dream will come true it already is
happening because why are to the trip to
Florida Japan I talked about we already
had gone to Florida to Disney World
she does have boys
integral to the team
kind of like here around the corner you
can go a little bit further that deep
down two blocks to the right and that's
where you're going to be working out for
now next to not only our 24-hour Fitness
butter you're off the team
the team will continue to train without
you but you're off the team you off the
team but we ask that you don't make an
issue out of this so you just kindly
leave so actually that's not our stuff
that's your stuff back bro get the fuck
yeah actually this is being bad as your
bed our body so these are your
going-away present you got a peg these
are gonna come guys walk out we got your
Ranger gift and
