know where to start
oh shit this is breakfast food right

that sockos there's my other side this
place is huge

but you you feel like you only could
pick one at a time it's like oh you like
whitewater I teach snowboarding and
camping shit let's do one at a time it's
like cool it's ok well it's because of a
really long line I get breakfast food
you're ridiculous I'll be good alright
so I've learned that I need to portion
control when I go to a buffet cuz I
always make this stupid mistake that
like when I'm getting stuff I'm over
flow and like put a bunch of shit on top
a bunch of shit and I never finish
anything because I get full relief ash
so I learned and I just get a spoonful
maybe like half a ladle full of each
portion so that I could taste everything
yeah
a lot of people when they go to buffets
they give portions thanks for getting a
three item comedian but you're not cuz
you're gonna get like a fifty item combo
something thinks we have to get
appropriate sizes yeah no one taught me
that I'm loser like you
you have nothing like her look she's
doing a great job well I also take into
consideration how much I'm named and
what I should get I don't know daddy
that I just go with my motion but I'm
not gonna get some fuckin vegetables
well I am Ashley here oh I don't know
where though look at all this table with
all this food I don't know if I'm going
to finish everything I'm going to try
though I don't want to be wasteful oh

water second it's still one one our t1
was I'm not arguing that oh that's not
what I'm arguing at all yes you won't no

yesterday you said verbatim that because
you lost on the water that it indicated
the fact that we won first are you
denying that I'm not a gating that boom
in your face no we're not really gaining
them well why'd you shut up and put your
legs out thank you no one's talking to
you you don't like talking to you
nothing games an MPA rise the matter
what the points are it does it doesn't
matter it does but it doesn't matter but
for your pride it matters so it doesn't
it's a tie right now no so if you were
to bet money right now
okay we're betting money he we we lost
by two points they lost by 20 who do you
have your money on for the next one it
doesn't matter two separate games no no

if you were betting on a team right and
their history was theirs the same team

different game and out of that game one
team out of the same two loses by 20
points what is a different game

changing the point the point is
different do anything as you lost the
first time

goes well we won the whole thing because
we beat you by more points it doesn't
work like that because no I would try
one to say yesterday you cannot say

that's beautiful that's a friend
what
yeah
oh we're going the wrong way so we just
got to downtown Vegas and you guys are
going to see an extreme difference when
was uh when was most of this stuff
constructed looks like it was done like
in the 60s 70s to be honest yeah I think
most of the stuff was uh the
infrastructure was built generally like
the era in the film casino right right
right right so it's such an extreme
change I'm going are we what is that
he's I don't know alright from going
from one section to Vegas to the next so
you guys saw the really pretty side the
newer side the more touristy side now
we're gonna get down and dirty with the
grimy little nook it's pretty nice
though golden egg it is we don't like
that a lot of money into it so it
doesn't have the crackhead granny feel
that's that's the word I was searching
for okay I talked about maybe like
shrimp cocktail and they looking funky
yesterday fucking the weights to hold my
father you know prostitute and you look
all dry oh my god alright I'm gonna go
inside now
here's just a little glimpse of what the
casinos and sign and everything looks
like out here I just look at the sign it
just looks old it just looks old it's
really cool font though alright so we're
in the Golden Nugget
it looks just recently remodeled but I
want to take you guys outside these
could really get a taste and feel
what I'm talking about
so this is the biggest I'm talking about
I bring this out
because it is
you will see the most interesting
characters out here it's really a whole
different crowd of people that come here
see you have those guys
yes sir
we're gonna use your senses we're trying
to figure out where perhaps we don't
know if it was this casino or that
casino
my bad casino and this is what you
supply that's right
you should blend right up here for three
months
well we're gonna go figure out where was
that we were
Oh
so
I want to so they're really capitalizing
on old-school Vegas here
even the machines a crazy old
just like the quality of people
everyone's so different here it smells
great
Yeah right
oh hell yeah
oh my god
oh my god
I don't understand what I'm watching
right now
Oh
forty
I can't watch as I can't watch this like
how my god
you
over here now
fill it here now
it's a question
me
oh did you want to hit that the shirt
that I got the just goes here that guy
they don't fucking change their arms
everywhere oh it's over
everyone is well not everywhere mainly
Vint and our and mainly Vincent David
are freaking out and help book and
freaky everything out here is it's like
the complete opposite of what we saw in
the regular touristy part of Vegas so
they're just like what the fuck is going
on one section just adult babies other
section is a grower they're two thing
you know so they're having a good time
turning on the lights so let's a little
bit better
but the rest of the area is so dead and
abandoned
we're waiting on our uber right now
since we flew we don't have a car how
far away is it four minutes
okay Robert
his name is Robert yeah now we're at new
york new york way way different than
what you guys just witnessed right look
how do you feel being back over here
people are a little bit more normal
words they're not characters anymore
one super important thing to remember
especially in Vegas if you're gambling
and holding onto chips even money it's
roses it gets passed on from person to
person so it's always important to wash
your hands and that part is doing
I'm going to do the same thing I'll born
in Rome Greece but this is my least
favorite part here has eternal romper is
the one piece looks like this
Ducky's a restroom that means have to
take everything off so
it looks like we're outside but we're
actually inside
it's like one big huge set it's really
cool in here leave the floor
I think this is like the 70s for like 60
in the bathroom
photos of the old paper boys you know
they're harmonic in the 30s yeah the
little under my britches and now
big old satchel about the newspapers
deliveries a scheme like old school old
school New York yeah
it's like restaurant row or something
all right so we are at Gallagher's right
now and this is where we're going to
have our dinner what the hell am I
looking at so this is H steak you get
out on legit Steakhouse they don't give
you just the meat that looks like what
you get at the restaurant or not the
restaurant by the grocery store or at
the butcher what they do with the aegis
in times 21 days if it's 30 days and
what that does is it draws out some of
the moisture but it really makes the
beef taste and also the fattiness of the
beef really sinks that into the meat so
when they grill it
nice beefy taste that
Wow so this is H this is the aging
process is it like a refrigerator or
freezer
on December 31st 2015
what the fuck how does it not go bad
recovered insult ideas called a crime
within salt water and it cover it and
then they keep it in like a it's kind of
like a try fridge so it's actually
really really dry in there
oh my goodness I can't wait to eat it
them
oh there it is
the beep aging process
fifteen days three weeks of wet aging
after this reader
dry-aged on the bone 15 days following
three weeks

tissue
