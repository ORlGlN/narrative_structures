his ear around his eyes good morning
beautiful people I know it's been a
minute since I've put out a video for
tea for you guys but I am I am in a lot
of new JK skits so if you guys missed my
funky face you will see a lot of me when
it comes to our the reason why I am
vlogging now is because last night was a
super windy night and I couldn't sleep
because it was like sixty to ninety mile
per 90 miles per hour wind so it was
just like you could just imagine how the
house was rattling and like the gate was
just like freaking rattling like crazy
and like on the house
cracking and creaking it just being
hella scary so the power ended up ended
up going out last night the power I'd
end up going out last night so this
morning it's still out so we can't get
any JK work done I can't get any work
done
so I come outside because we have to hit
up like a local tea shop or somewhere
where they offer we free Wi-Fi and I see
this look at this right in front of my
house we're getting that over that's not
the only mine here and then there's
another one there yes it's like there's
like a bunch of like broken trees and
like a bunch of like debris all over the
place because of the crazy winds last
night and they say that tonight's
actually gonna be just as windy so I'm
kind of scared because I couldn't go to
sleep at all I'm such a big-ass baby I
was just like up all night and I'm like
oh my god what's gonna happen is a roof
gonna come off if I have
bootleg freaking roofer that made my
house then that shit's gonna fly off so
cross your fingers I survive another
night that's tight
I'm gonna have to mask
