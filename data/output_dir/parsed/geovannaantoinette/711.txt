guess where I am if you guessed it I'm
in the desert just kidding
finally made my way out and there's like
seriously nobody here so it's like we
have gone out of our so I wouldn't call
this all this snow
yeah I'm really stoked haven't been here
for like over a year and a half I would
say so I'm glad to finally be out here I
do embark good how about our first front
but
I'm going down like a bitch really
really good he's just being modest he's
really good
I'm the pansy over here I haven't
snowboard in a while so I'm really
scared right now
so yeah I'm not writing as as average as
I should be
it's um you come I'm not gonna tell you
what's in there but it's bomb
