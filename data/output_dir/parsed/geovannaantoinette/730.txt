a 3000 year old tree
wait there's more as more
and all three thousand years old
whose fall is hella old just stop for a
restroom break but we are still up in
the mountains and literally in the
clouds you don't know that I mean look
that is the tour bus it's not fog we are
in the clouds that's how high up we are
see burning people in tents is
prohibited in this area does anyone know
what this is if you guessed a bone
you're a winner
mmm Taiwanese sausage
you get all this
going on a little exploration
we have to wear helmets because there's
rocks that are always falling apparently
and you don't want to be liable for any
dents yeah I feel really excited
this helmet seriously smells like crap
smells like someone didn't take a shower
for like 20 days and was sweating so
after work like this I don't get to get
STDs on my head
the Asian spot in action

waterfall
