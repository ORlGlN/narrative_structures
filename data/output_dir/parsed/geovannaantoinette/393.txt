what's up beautiful people today is kind
of a day off for me I will be doing work
later on in the day but right now I'm
gonna take advantage of the Sun I'm
gonna take advantage of the weekend and
I'm gonna catch up on life and on being
a real girl so I'm gonna get my nails
done get my hair done run a couple
errands specifically to Ikea because I
love I kiss so much and I can't wait coz
I've I've I got my nails done for Japan
back in December and it's now March
um so I'm like it's time I have like
really brittle nails I know it's
probably like some vitamin deficiency
that I have or whatever um so I don't
know I I just I just want more I don't
know I just want femi hands and it
actually does help me every time I get a
manicure they put on a coat to make my
nails stronger and thicker and stuff so
that's what I need to get cuz they break
so fast and I've always loved long nails
but I never can get them really long
because I don't move very gracefully
when they grab something I just grab it
to like fucking kill it I think that's
my part and I are such a great couple
but when I grab it I like smack the
table off hit something and then I look
at my nails broke and I'm like God dang
it
so when I do get a manicure and I get
gels done or acrylic I try to stay away
from kerlick because ladies you know
it's gonna leave your nails super
brittle and super thin so I just try to
stick to gel but yeah I need them to
hook me up because these man-hands
aren't cutting it no more I just got to
my nail place and I do this all the time
I leave my house without makeup and then
I get to the place like maybe 15 20
minutes early and then I do my makeup in
the car so right now I'm just adding
like eyeliner to my waterline and I mean
I think that's as good as it's gonna get
for doing my car in the makeup and
parked again by the way I'm not driving
yeah cuz I was wearing like I just had
sorry I'm digging through my purse here
I just had eyeliner on No
mascara nothing and I just look like a
crackhead
so I'm like ah shit I better complete my
makeup but yeah about to walk in get my
nails did look like a girl
oh god I'm fucking weird I'm so sorry
I'm gonna just cut this clip right now
I'm fucking weird take your time
guess I'm all done got my nails done
got a slight acrylic
that
not too bad
anyway I look cute I lift
so these might get in the way when I
bench a little bit but I think it should
be alright not too long
yay slowly becoming the girl again
okay I just along now getting my hair
done
look at this it's so bad
dry and damaged hair
bathroom break getting my hair processed
wall-mount process but this is a
processing process um getting rid of the
grays and evening out the color I'm
gonna go a little bit lighter here I was
a lot more blond before but then because
of winter I went a little bit dark but
look how dry my hair looks hopefully
they can fix that but look at that can't
wait to show you guys the final product
so this is a salon
all right finally home who the hell what
the hell
papa papa
hey papa look my hair I wouldn't even
really seen it yet it's a lot wider I
can't tell the difference
ah you serious
it's crazy lighter yes see you later
well they haven't seen it either this is
it no this is way lighter is a crazy
lighter I think it's cause my eyes
aren't on sensitive because this is how
much all of it so right here this spot
right here
wait get this guy up so this right here
was how majority of my hair was this
dark oh really yes this right here yeah
now it's all this it's super lights true

know where I'm gonna put it yeah yeah
I'll put it oh it's called Kristoff and
it's in Beverly Hills um don't be
discouraged but anyway um she's really
good she's she's amazing at highlights
so she had like five people she was
working on today so is me and four other
people and she just kept going back and
forth with all of us but with me it took
really long
she had to go from this shade of brown
all the way to this so she had to strip
the color away every time she would like
leave treatment in my hair so first you
start with the base cuz I had a lot of
gray hair so she started with the base
and she had to do that first yeah she
did that first and I when she did that
then she slowly started stripping it
away and for those of you guys that
followed my snapchat you saw all of the
process know her hair is blonde blonde
