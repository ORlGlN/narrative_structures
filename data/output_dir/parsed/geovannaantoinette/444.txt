like that first thing Gio does which it
gets off the plane is to get a sign of
who welcome to Japan
hey ro you big puny look this woulda
this wouldn't get oh look at how
organized gina's luggages but I do it
doesn't look like it doesn't look like
she packed everything in five seconds
before the flight it looks like she
planned for at least three weeks
straight strategically does a Pikachu
outfit to match her Pikachu pillow never
know I need to go long in the city okay
where are your clothes even clean yes
okay
I can't fall my gloves we get a freaking
bun so many of us I've met
rode on a bus we traveled with Jacob
that's how we roll we go big soon do you
know how many people we flew out this
time yeah look at all these passports
holy moly
how many people do you think we flew out
this time make 15 Wow
they shoot tomorrow and get everyone's
passes oh this is so cool
so if you guys don't know every year at
the end of the year we do a company JK
trip where me and Joey fly out everyone
and we do different things and every
year as the company grows we're trying
to do bigger and more fun things and it
started off with just like a really
small Vegas trip then the year after
that who rented one of those big
Bellagio Suites that's like two thousand
square feet where there's like twice as
many bathrooms and bedrooms just because
that's how big the suite is and then
last year we went to Hawaii and this
room with the Japan so this is really
cool that as the company grows we get to
spread the fun and kind of reward
everyone that's been working so hard and
everyone voted on Japan we actually
voted which country want to go to Greece
is on the table
Egypt is on the table some parts of
South American on the table but everyone
ended up voting on Japan and then so I'm
really happy that means you're able to
fly out everyone the whole company even
extended JK like Gina and David to all
come out and go to Japan and I'm really
excited because it's the first time I've
ever been in Japan so it's gonna be
awesome we're driving we're driving
through the streets of Tokyo right now
and first of all we're on the left hand
side and that's the way they roll out
here but the thing that impresses me the
most is how clean the streets are
there's like no gum on the streets
there's no trash in the curb or in the
gutter super clean this whole place it's
insane how clean it is kind of reminds
me of time want this fish reminds me of
like a way cleaner Taiwan yeah take a
brand new city earth cuz Taiwan is this
but with stray dogs and trash on the
floor it's normal
this is abnormally clean it's super
clean look like they just wash the
floors yeah it has that after rain look
it doesn't look all the cars are
what there's a cricket on on the
reflection I thought I saw a crooked
restaurant
mother's restaurant over there I'm
behind you
look how cute this street is ma bear
yeah you big cutie you double look it's
polar oh this piece of trash ruin my
shot god damn it
Oh Devon the sewer cats are nice that's
like a say and so interesting because um
there's just these random vending
machines in the middle of alleyways like
there's nothing going on and then all of
a sudden there's a vending machine
that's really cool though because then
it makes like getting little snacks and
drinks really convenient but oh my God
look how fucking clean this alleyway is
it's so crazy how clean it is this would
be smelling like piss in America or at
least in LA Japan is so clean and so
convenient there's all these old vending
machine this is crazy so we finally made
it to our room and I think we might have
the biggest room because you got the two
biggest people yeah well now I'm not the
biggest and the longest for sure but
you're the baby look how long an arm is
ticking arm up here stick arm up yeah
that's not big well you take up a lot of
space alright I'm long
yeah you're long which also increase the
surface area
lengthwise which is fine so free I can
see wait anji in this way yeah right so
I'm not big you're big you alone take up
more than hot lattice but you can't call
me big don't want to be called big way
you like that big-ass fucking lady uh
mom don't you be cuny Kiki I got a stack
of freaking pillows and stuff here and
yeah if you might call it for a night we
might get something to eat
just cuz we're hella tired it's like 11
o'clock now which is like four am its 4
a.m. for us but I'm glad that I am tired
because that means I won't be jet-lagged
and when it's time to sleep I'll be able
to sleep and tomorrow I'll give you guys
a tour of our place and I'll give you a
thorough tour because this house is
small but also cute shit
a chair don't me tuck you in no I took
you in at night it took me up big hear
me Oh long not no oh thank you
Domo so uh we're wandering around the
streets right now and it's uh pretty
much 11:30 or 11 o'clock at night and
it's hard to find anything that's open
on or that can fit like 10 or 12 people
and we just stumbled across this ramen
shop and I'm trying to communicate with
them I don't speak Japanese
he isn't speak English and it's not even
that that language that you can kind of
guess like if you go to Latin America
and say like I wasn't with you you can
kind of eat your way around yeah like
it's Latin based you can go figure it
out but this is a different language
that like we can't even guess words
right I use my fingers and say there's
12 well first I said can we come in and
he's not it and now I was just trying to
point like I was using like making up
sign language he said we could come and
I said there's 12 and then he was like
holy shit he had the holy shit look on
his face yeah I just it making simple I
pointed at this picture I point out that
picture and I was like 12
is that okay and he was like okay so
with complete language barriers were
able to communicate that we had 12 of
those things
that's what we're gonna eat just to make
it simple no one chooses anything it's
gonna be the easiest way to order and
he's just gonna go to town right now and
make some food
oh we don't prepare the soup base this
looks bomb already oh cool so fast you
already made three batches of ramen I'm
gonna steal this guy's secrets and take
it back to the states and call it JK
ramen
that was pretty bomb actually this guy
knows what he's doing watch it tastes
like shit hopefully it doesn't come
hungry anything tasty right now well
bean sprouts was it thrown in there
Oh more needles that's pretty cool
always put a little eggs in there hmm
bamboo shoots these guys hooking it up
what's that a little horns or something
these guys put in like little trashes
and then that looks pretty bomb yeah
it's pretty little cha shoes in there
then watching this is making my mouth
water it's 11:05
it's just hand back glad the balls are
kind of big we at least have an Xbox in
here presentation pretty tight oh yeah
he hooks it up with seaweed it's a kind
of seaweed on a ship
like I can walk over an hour I haven't
felt like an eagle I still covering
things you can thing out oh did you just
make up words
I thought dull moments thank you no it's
more like Houston exchange without
exchanging Oh is on mine ooh
alright one try you Devon alright so
this is my first taste of Japan in Japan
and I'm excited I love ramen and I'm
hungry and somebody just screamed on the
TV and this is just randomly picked a
restaurant - that's good but you're
reading from this room yeah yeah babe I
was I'm gonna turn my own right now
Oh oh my god that's delicious
spray bomb oh my god I can't wait I
don't have anything yet
Claudia Jaya just a random place dude
Casey wants to know the Nitto quality
it's a broad day something sounds pretty
good yeah it's not like some fast bus
bring them better than oh yeah did you
meet yeah by far this is not so msg how
do you two like it I'm gonna buy it oh
my god we just walked in here like not
knowing anything
how many things have literally just pick
this on the whim don't know how to
communicate and I'm excited
I know it's delicious just get over the
fact that they smell any boy you know I
got smoking up a storm of it they don't
have the new US laws yet he could be
phds DVF is comfort food on
the weather good call where ever wanted
was I think Michael called the shots we
were supposed to go to this Chinese
place hey there was those Chinese
restaurant that that this guy
recommended because the only thing I was
open but we walked by here Michael's
like I want this now and then Victini
was open house it Priya me so the
problem is having a slurp fest in here
but that's the proper way to eat though
cuz if you don't slurp it doesn't taste
as good you gotta aerate the food as it
goes in your mouth
When in Rome make loud noises no
well just a Papa way you go to Mexico
yeah that's I said When in Rome if you
go to Mexico it's a different room so
you adapt to their culture but in this
room everyone slurps and if you don't
step there like this guy does not eat
organic ass joke so yellow
this guy's slurping this fucking life
away there so afterwards got acne a
little dessert stop by the 7-eleven
and got this green tea mochi looking
thing and I love mochi and I grew up on
actually I want to try some mochi
um and it's so soft yeah oh okay
mmm
the red bead on the inside yeah hold it
hold it hold it hold it hold it hold it
hold it hold it wow it's so blurry it's
not focusing yeah
vicious and there's Japanese locals but
I told it on the phone
I'll find me a soap box what is shouted
so loud
my airplane you weren't snowing out of
the u.s. nor
all right nice to make this
