so back it even Canyon but today's going
to be a little bit different just
because I brought an expert friend of
mine that has done these too many
different times so apparently there are
more waterfalls than what I showed you
guys before that's Amy
that's Jenny Jenny come here explain it
to me I don't know three hours four
hours Oh faster how many one how many
waterfalls are you gonna see hopefully
if I don't die before 27 oh okay well if
I die this time
it sounds yeah this sounds more
profitable than the all the other times
I told you guys were gonna die um I hope
you get to see this bug I'm just taking
a little break so I could show you guys
that I haven't died yet I'm still good
however this route over here at the
bottom is what I normally take and it
just wraps around the mountain that we
are I'm Jenny that we're at that we are
spending on so you keep going keep going
and then that's where that waterfall I
showed you the last time was where
there's like 40 good bazillion people um
but we have to climb these Ridge rigid
ass rocks to get to where we at so
here's a me still alive kicking ass
Jenny and then uh pardon how's that part
oh shit so we just came off that big ass
we run pointing we've climbed all the
way up there
we're down here now completely empty
look at Amy right there's a little red
backpack over there
that's her so we have Bart this isn't
for your average person like if you have
any sort of condition of a heart problem
physical condition then you can't do
this one really and you need hiking
shoes with grip on it I see it made the
same mistake I still haven't bought any
shoes with any further grip so I'm
really surprised that I'm from here so
we made it to the very first waterfall
however the one that is riveted to my
last video was where all of you are
we're actually at the very top
he's gonna go inside the waterfall
I don't you could see that wow she's
actually in there in that darkness
hopefully you could see it through the
waterfall leaving you must take it
okay whoopee we're gonna go to where
she's at right now watch
guys I hope you
check this out damn this is gorgeous I
didn't even know there were places like
this that existed in LA
so beautiful Amy kind of disappeared she
wrapped around that right there should
climb that rock but look at how
beautiful the water is I love these I
wanted to jump in but we're probably
like an hour into biking right now and
we've only seen one waterfall there's
seven of them so hopefully we make it to
all seven but from what their
experiences we will probably just make
it to five
there's nobody here again
we came down that way all the way that
way
it's a lot of fun
yes yeah it's not fun actually
shorts
