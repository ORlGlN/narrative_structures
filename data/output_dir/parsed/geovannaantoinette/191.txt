good morning beautiful bail family oh I
like that I think I would a communicate
if you haven't noticed I just woke up
and I woke up at my new place that as
you can see right behind me there's
nothing really going on but a mess so
that's my mom and she doesn't want to be
on the vlogs anymore she's just like I'm
too shy I don't like when you put me in
these dogs so uh for her privacy we're
not gonna put her in it anymore so oh
you guys won't see my mom anymore so
sorry guys but today is kind of an
exciting but a little bit of a nut
hectic day there's a stressful a very
stressful hectic because it's a lot of
unpacking and organizing and that's like
not the fun stuff for me I like the
decorating and the buying and then the
other people in spelling all that stuff
type of thing like I'll show you why so
right now this is the current room
situation we're sleeping on the floor
because my bed frame hasn't arrived yet
and I have to hang up all these clothes
that initially I had strategy for I had
it all all the hooks fishing the same
way I had it piled on very nicely I
loaded it into the car that way because
my strategy was okay grab them by the
hooks moving from the car to right into
the closet but Bart was like I'll unload
it for you I got you and then when he
took him out he threw it on the floor
like this look whatever you do this so
now I have to sit here and sort through
everything and then I have a bunch of
toiletries here that I have to organize
don't know how that's going to happen
yeah and then I have a bunch of clothes
in here don't know how that's gonna
happen got to organize all these things
so I definitely have my work cut out for
me today and luckily was a day off for
us
usually we film just kidding party today
but um difficut are out in Paris
prepping some details for their wedding
that
can't even go through I can't fly when
they're getting married
so for those of you guys that don't know
pregnant women cannot be in the air in
the third trimester so right now I'm in
my second trimester and for those of you
that don't know because I didn't know
before being pregnant at a trimester and
I would think duh but a trimester is 3
months and a woman is pregnant for nine
months so that's three trimesters and
each trimester two months so I've
already went past my first trimester I'm
in my second trimester and the end of my
second trimester is May which means
that's the last month that I can slide
but tiffin case you're trying to get
married in July which is two months into
the third trimester and it's super
dangerous for me to fly out there there
could be you know complications it's
such a long flight it's just not it's
not a good situation to be in so
unfortunately Bart and I will be missing
physically missing their wedding but I
already told TIFF I don't give a shit if
there's a time difference I am going to
FaceTime you better save a seat for me
with a fucking iPad I'm going to sit
there I'm going to cry and you're going
to we're going to burn I are going to be
in our wedding attire
it'll probably be nighttime over here
but we're going to be no wedding attire
and we're going to be on that FaceTime
and we're going to be watching you guys
get married like we're not messing this
shit
but yeah so why did it bring all this
stuff up shit I never listened to myself
but yeah yeah I forgot why I brought
that up oh yeah that's why I have a deal
because they're they're doing their
wedding stuff out in Paris so it's a day
off for the rest of us Jamie it looks
like I've got it but anyway this
alright time to tackle the mountain see
how long it takes me so right now I'm
gonna put up the timer good why not
timer starts now let's go boom all done
and it only took me 30 minutes oh yeah
and that's that little bit and that is
that I had the help of my mom and it
still took me three minutes
Bart really fucked me hard when he
figuratively speaking when he dumped all
the clothes there I was just like fuck
Lorna Doone out so I never had this
option before but you know that Harry
Potter room when we first walk in I'll
show you guys in a second but I'm going
to use that a Harry Potter room to put
all my big thick jackets down there cuz
my it'll fit in my closet but it's just
like so much space taken up because
these things are so sick so I'm going to
go put it down there now because I guess
it should be a closet for coats a coat
closet so I maximize space that week so
I don't know what else to you that room
for alright let's go can you get to work
