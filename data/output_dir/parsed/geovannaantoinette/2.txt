straighten my hair cut Diana should be
damages it does right so it took me kind
of forever but this is kind of where I'm
at now I don't know if I should put it
down keep it up but yeah these are the
threads today I put this here because
when I do my makeup I don't like the
cold for my butt but these are the
threads today I don't even know if it
really matches but I don't really care
yeah so I bought super skinny jeans
right yeah really good that says my
ankles are so small even the bottom is
still kind of loose and then I want it
to be like really nice and tight and I
found one way to do it
what you do see make it as tight as you
see Oh skinny ankle problems there it's
like that's really cool
woman do you even think of that oh oh
Brandon because they're like the young
guy so they're like you know like the
newest tricks of the trade
oh there's action and it's not cuffing
but it's something else and he said oh
have you ever tried that was it what's
that it showed me well is that what I'm
saying is that all those yeah that's
great cool damn well now you know folks
so we're just spending another maybe a
half day because we're gonna go home
today but a half day of rest and
relaxation with no real agenda go with
the flow last day Vegas what in the
world is something much fun crazy it
took
diminishing then it said it still feels
fine

headache medicine
well this carpet looks trippy
on the camera it looks really cheap
paper yeah look oh yeah movie that trip
you guys out definitely trip me up I'm
so right now we are on our way to get
Papa some headache medicine so Vegas is
always known for birthdays there's
always a father this huge amount of
stuff so because I have a headache
I don't have the biggest appetite I'll
chew it's a waste of money no agent
it'll work so right so right and the
word on the street is there's a couple
of restaurants where the chef as
Michelin stars and I'm always interested
in
Oh
what's always like this
oh shit even goes all the way down there
yeah alright so I thought that we could
walk around and figure it out but this
place is huge and I just forget
Paul massive casinos are so I went on
the trusty old Yelp and I found this
spot called Bordeaux I hope I'm
pronouncing it right and the food looks
really good really clean pretty simple
but like delicious
yeah looks fancy but it still looks not
rich yeah yeah yeah yeah it looks good
but I know if I eat it it's gonna be a
blob of fat yeah yeah no this one looks
good and the core looks really dope well
why did I put it away there we go
so I think you got my approval I think
just cuz I like that how do they do that
they have like a stencil maybe and then
they put powder on it cuz it won't catch
is powder I don't know they have seafood
so if you want live oysters oh I don't
want to go I'll border this area today
really you get a boner is supposed to be
aphrodisiac Oh
I think you're fine alright so we're
gonna check out right now let's figure
out where the hell of it oh there's a
buffet Berto look at the inside

already on the right track Videla

the dishes are really small the world's
best butter I didn't even know that was
the reward all right papa so the first
