so this is super cool this is
first time ever an agenda and agenda
this giant trade show for street worth
and everyone's here
a z-star raw 19 literally anyone and
everyone
in streetwear and wants to get into
street wear or the culture of street
wear or the lifestyle of street where is
here and we've been trying to come here
for like the past three or four years
and we try to do all kinds of sneaky
stuff I try to get media passes through
JK we try to come here yes
people and it's very expensive either
can you can either come as a buyer like
you're a retail store or an exhibitor
exhibits favorites
but this year we were able to meet
someone who goddess and just really
really close shouts the parliaments
thank you so much
he knows one of the founders of the
gymnast so which is why we're here but
we're here to get inspired for barbell
brigade and just kind of open our eyes
to what exists in the street where world
and I'm here with Evan Bob Baer mark our
barbell team and I can't wait to show
you guys what I get to see so I'm in the
meet up agenda right now and one really
cool thing about agenda is because it is
a tradeshow it's a place where all the
vendors come and they want to get
retailers to come fire orders
and probably late 20 18 20
what champion has going on some of these
space-age looking bubble jackets with
patches and stuff so these things may
not look in style right now but there
will be in a year
that's champions new stuff
I'm definitely gonna have to check out
the booth
balance is I'm rocking New Balances
right now
in a big kind of New Balance I love them
I first got into New Balance and as a
kid when I
the end of the whole casual street wear
market and they're coming out some
really really cool
other ways so a lot of these boots I
can't really go in because the things
that they're showing are coming and
upcoming
don't want to get Jack watch on so I
could only show you guys from a distance
but this is their booth and these are
some of the things that they will be
coming out with in the near
future
so I love this dress
this has been like kind of my favorite
color these days yeah what is that like
a quiche
he pitched 13 festive
yeah but make it part of all I was
saying which
oh I like to see that maybe a little bit
more fitted not as box you sense
I could see it being really
I like this reflective print - I can see
it coming they're using a lot of
reflective stuff car like a little bit
yeah we're like our sleeve right here is
reflective
well no piece but we're gonna that's
t-shirt on the floor right there as
reflective print it's really cool to see
like all these plans and where they're
going and it gives us a lot of
inspiration and it makes me feel good
that's pop oh this is really cool this
is like a skater side of the valley
or instead of like sneakers the more
skate and casual inspired I really like
this colorway that's dope
so cool
so this is supercool element skateboards
they have like this whole like summer
party
it's like little summer camp badges
there's a little
fires little teepees it's a
really cool cohesive
Leigha Native American elements it takes
me back
dangerous
water
what I like about the entire branding of
agenda it's it looks really cool and
it's really cohesive from that front big
agenda sign I think I saw in the first
clip all the way to this show area where
it just leaves us a little barrel and
these painted pallets when you look at
it looks really cool and there's
awesome like creative singular voice and
it looks like it cost a lot of money but
then when you really break it down
everything's cheap like that is probably
a fake tree you get it probably all
barrels for cheap pallets are really
cheap those are just home depot lights
that they just hung up so what I liked
about like streetwear compared to I
guess the major labels I can do look out
big big labels I could be or all around
I'm a big fan of those guys too but it's
a different creative approach with those
guys who's about highest quality items
of course is going to be expensive
Pulis tree where they don't necessarily
have access to the best
fabrics and materials but they have a
lot of creativity put into the garments
of clothing and you can the tell from
the trade show that this is also evident
here
look at this topaz booth everything is
VHS that's all cool this old-school
Jackie Chan movie hell yeah yeah
throwback or not
Rambo 3 you see rumble 3 yeah how's
everything about but across apart
it's under fun of
one of my biggest inspirations on
Instagram name's Jeff staple
and staple bran is so he always uses
like just big old pigeon coop and the
whole booth is like that and one thing I
really like about this brand is he took
the pigeon and I've never let this
article where you're saying I like
out there that always trying to take
like the extremes and Ally and our eagle
or whatever please like but what about
in everyday bird like a vision that does
the everyday person and people are
always looking for like the most extreme
shit or inspiration or
like something to look up to but you can
look at a pigeon it's also very colorful
let's great seljuqs great unique and if
you take something like that why can't
we use that as
so cool that he's able to take a pigeon
which is look at everyday bird but there
are a lot of cool colors in it
got the logo of the brand that's it
so we're outside right now try to get a
picture adjust April
that's appointment only so-so Geo just
took a picture of an hundreds
over there and I'm kind of shy Sanko
bottom even though I did talk to Prague
five minutes already Paul made an
awesome introduction but I just want to
point out that the booth this fuck is
sick and it's very exclusive looking you
came to see what's inside it's just all
black and it seems like they're going
with this new branding with the lighting
pole inside the flag and
I don't know what's going on behind the
bread but it could be what barbell ran
into where we're trying to sponsor
events on an international stage our old
skull logo people thought it kind of
offensive it could be a way of how since
through the world is there mob logo my
some people might also find that
get triggered by that so they're finding
a more neutral logo which I think this
fucking dope and I love everything black
and white and that's with my sweater has
barbells like that and it's really cool
to see their booth the same way
behind me is Pendleton it's also one of
my other favorite brands who saw it I
just bought a bunch of shirts for them
they make all the war by all the subtly
cool flannels and I love all the Indian
print they have coming out really cool
super dope a lot of these companies
unfortunately
these reasons
oh all my friends somebody been
traditionally streetwear but to just
coming in and trying to expand the
market is so
I'm not too familiar with this brand I
know they make shoes but the booth is
really cool yeah
and I like how they have like fiberglass
or something and they lit it from the
inside so it looks like it's growing
on concrete yet sick
fuck yeah I only said that because
someone gave me is all you can't see it
never mind
it sounds crazy
this displays so cool he's making an
actual surfboard in the booth
look at that sanding it down a bunch of
raw surfboards over here really really
cool
that's pretty badass
and he put your brother's all over the
Southfork got home and ma bear already
got crazy comfortable look at her rope
just so comfy space in here yeah but
what she's wearing is exactly what I
feel since I'm on inch over when I go to
those events and yeah I learn a lot I
meet all these really really cool people
but afterwards I felt like I worked for
12 hours I'm just so tired some people
aren't reverter they get energy from
then they can't wait to go to the
after-party for me I want to know where
the after-party is so I can avoid that
place I can go home but now that we're
back I'm complete took my pants off so I
did it like rinse can I still have
another event tonight our buddy
Ben who owns a gym shark he's having a
pop-up shop in LA and we're gonna go
stop by that thing and I'm really
excited to see that and what do you have
to say about all of this you freaking
monster you little monster what do you
have to say about all of this you've a
happy guy mr. happy you're gonna come
back so old when you're like four and
then you're gonna look at this and I'm
like wow I was such a happy baby huh
yeah happy baby tyka you're not gonna do
cuz he sees his big black thing in his
face fine
this is new thing though there's this
new thing that geo and her mom does
where they shake their leg and I think
taka likes it and he likes hearing his
voice waver so every time they start
shaking their lake he actually starts
making a noise to go along with it
god damn you know make me look bad
come on do it in the project I think I
was probably like 2 your fire in college
might be true but you look like ya coach
is great this sub-prime 20 years old
things
