it's about romance
so no one's perfect where we all have
our strengths and our weaknesses
wherever they're weak someone else on
the team is running sir it's just later
at Expo heels gambia got a whip and she
started drinking oh goodness
so well-rounded and so bellies that like
work synergistically and harmoniously
actually the guy with his his two week
old beer that beard only took him two
weeks guys two weeks I don't know how he
does it but two weeks suppose we use his
horse shampoo I was working the last one
I think this is like a major upgrade
from our last booth last year Aaron he
made the booth all those super tight at
the moment this is way cooler sorry
I don't know I just want people to be
aware that there's a gem like this
really provides some haters towards
athletes
Murrell a you know a lot of people drive
like 20 miles you know
we don't meet those same people that are
welcome to dr. Jim came here last year
just to check out barbell to see what
they're about and look at me now setting
you up I'll be another fall brought
another day to just about it give our
Jim exposure the right exposure that he
needs
so that gym can expand in this year
whole world to love us so that could be
like out yeah Barbara game is the djinns
now let's go
it could be a straight meet today
Saturday today is Friday
I got feeling we're doing aside we feel
good we feel fine we feel like this all
the time how do you know that how do you
know I don't know you know what do you
guys wanna say to all the people are
gonna say what's up - you guys are Bo I
want to say you think
I was a little bit at first but as you
can see everything's really crap
and I really like really
and people started coming in every was
showing nothing but log
immediately change my mindset and like I
just embraced it I was like dude I'm so
happy to see you guys right now they're
like dude we love our bow so on this
side we are selling all of our apparel
as you can see here
we actually bought out speakers on the
second loop we're not to get that
every guy has to step on a scale and
have to get two points while his body
weight they're kind of getting anywhere
for ten and if you can do ten then we
give them one of these pretty bad
inside you get the shirt up needs choice
now for females same rules apply the
differences is only two times her body
weight I've only had one meal
I'm just excited to get all these people
there's so much energy I'm feeding off
of that everybody has a lot of energy
trills pump me up here coming Mia really
excited to be all these new people right
the Energy's good for the deadlift
session if you are getting really great
way too
so far today we only had six competitors
are able
to be honest I'm more present with the
girls man I thought some girls didn't
look as she lifted steady five or ten
easy
yeah very impressive I thought the whole
crowd looking at that girl and they were
all impressed
today we homeboy cuz everyone kept
asking where's what
we're smart which harbors are smart so
he's here today we're dead lot more fun
the only what we are missing out on now
is sure Oh contact these back to back at
barbell the gym holding that down
yesterday I was in Boston I had a show
out there and I just flew in last night
at like 12 o'clock midnight so I woke up
bright and early and now I'm here yeah I
think people get the misconception that
it's all about more than jail but I
don't think so because they're not
really barbell material to start off
with so I think it's a shaft that really
holds it together I run this yeah oh
they're just the fakers it's a thousand
percent the staff that makes
establishment without the staff barbell
brigade is just a big warehouse is a
bunch of weights and there's no soul and
light to it you know it's because of the
stuff that's we were able to build this
community and breathe life into the gym
and there's so much more to farm up
against it just wait but you cannot be
duplicated you can get another warehouse
do a little bit the same exact equipment
but without the staff you would not have
marble games you want to say thank you
for all the love and the support
honestly like
it brings us joy that you have people
loved our honor tip so much because I
feel like there's just a work that we
give it and actually you know because II
encouraging us to be better and provide
better services every little guy it was
cool he's like I liked how just you know
people just being able to come up and
just like they felt like Oh like you
know they felt like we were friends and
stuff like that but we liked it can't
wait till next year make sure I think
you mean way better because this one was
better than last year
so I feel like it's progressing over
time so I think it's gonna be pretty
late for it getting a massage while you
talk to everybody that stop by thank you
for letting us know we've actually all
you guys and the fact that you guys were
coming up to us and telling us that you
watch our stuff that was awesome
keep watching it she's supporting us and
stop by the gym for sure because I know
a lot of you have day passes bossbot you
wear your stretchy pants three the balls
and the squat roller coaster continues
so last night I didn't even sleep well
I slept late and I had to wake up super
early this morning at 6 a.m. because I
have a long day so I had to get the gym
in in the morning
