came in here because I started doing all
the cooking
I started do not a cook it oh please you
had some potatoes boiling in a pot when
I came in here and I did not you liar
you will not take that from me this is
too much I give up because I'm in potato
salad deviled eggs and this
you ruin stuff is it oh I don't want to
cover the lens angrily because it's
gonna delete the footage so just sorry
gently guys every time we can't cover
the lens it deletes like portions of log
so very gently let's do this I just cut
off what oh man I can't wait to show you
this recipe guys Bridget has the best
ham recipe I mean the best now dad told
us he didn't want ham he's like no ham
I've had enough ham but we still want
ham so for our Thanksgiving for when we
get back we got ham oh yeah oh yeah
in this crock pot we have a spiral ham
and what is this stuff you're putting on
it
this is mustard and brown sugar oh where
I've done yet folks we're not done it's
in a slow cooker where's the liquid what
kind of liquid are we having check this
out just sitting here doing the ham
still like I said some sort of liquid
has to go on it but what do you think it
is hmm
nothing's hot Michael what do you mean
only on the side I'd only pouring on the
sides not the top oh you can't
I didn't add it over the top let me make
this ham I got this okay oh so you just
keep adding it oh this is looking good
yeah don't pour it on top guys I didn't
pour it on top you said I did but I
didn't and all of my core beliefs and
fundamental like things that make me who
I am one thing I am strongly against its
product placement oh speaking of I could
use just a little touch more coke you
just reach out my hands from the ham
okay hey yes
rolls I'm about to show you guys a trick
to peeling potatoes first get a potato
out okay after its boiled now these ones
I got a stick back in to boil cuz
they're so huge so I'm about to cut it
up but I'm going to show you a way to
get that skin off so first I'm going to
cool it down
put it in the sink put some cold water
over oh that was hot cold water not hot
you're just gonna put the cold water
over it alright so you're just gonna
grip it and there you go oh my gosh did
you just see that it's frickin magic it
was like a camera trick right it just
comes right off you guys
no more peeling the potato beforehand
yeah screw that that's it you want to be
do it again okay my gosh turn that off
Oh be careful Michael
Bella watch out sweetie she's like right
in the wine Bella come here girl come on
she's like come on I gotta be quick she
came back I know okay so under the water
and I'm way more excited than I need to
be really excited to use potatoes more
now guys we didn't make potatoes ever
because it was too hard to peel them
those days are gone
yeah
good
hey Michael you wouldn't tell me me
chill out baby look at this Oh seriously
it's great it's a freaking lifesaver in
a fader saver finger saver yeah when you
peel potatoes cut yourself
I've never seen that before what yeah
half boiled potato yes holy crap the
reason it is because the potatoes we've
got are so gigantic these potatoes are
huge so guys I have to cut them during
the boiling process and cut them again
to do it so that's what you do it this
how you cut potato by the way it blows
this is so freakin awesome
yeah oh man
you keep it nice little wine and then
you just leave on the middle that is
awesome and you take your little chunks
put it back in the pot we're boiling
all right we're making mashed potatoes
Bridget earlier made potato salad and it
looked good oh god it was so good does
anybody want to see
Bridget's potato salad it's definitely
similar to grandpa's no it was better
yep bro this is only for potatoes by the
way four of those which is the
equivalent of four bags here we go oh my
god it's creamy it's I gotta put paprika
on it before we leave of course we don't
put paprika on us so can you put it on
that door yeah it's a garnish am a
deviled egg simply doubled eggs man my
back hurts
make it over it you think II think mine
doesn't hurt
Bridget's deviled eggs
which is dad's favorite part of
Thanksgiving so in mine too dad
well thanks give it back I freaking love
don't they think yeah well at least you
smell like them what you smell like
deviled eggs my body smell like double
day yeah your body we chopped all the
potatoes up you guys put them back in
the pot I'm gonna finish boiling them
and then I say it I make some fresh
homemade mashed potatoes and trust me
this recipe is legit
all right Bridget is adding some butter
straight to the potatoes lots of butter
straight to the potatoes sour cream yes
heavy cream yes yes and
these are probably my best
guys the art of mashed potatoes is you
want some chunk still in there but you
also want it smooth enough oh yeah
because the starch in the potatoes get
this position
oh man looks good
okay taste test number one
III don't mind my turn my turn
yeah the best match day is over had
really Wow is that butter in that extra
cream you did one and it'd be nice if I
could eat this every single day of my
life oh my god they're so good perfect
it would not be Thanksgiving without
some fresh homemade true-to-life
cranberry sauce so the first step you
want to do with making your homemade
cranberry sauce is puncture the bottom
of the pan
see when you puncture the bottom of the
can it slips right out oh my gosh our
knife got on it what holy crap
okay then you cut the knife layer right
off of that cranberry the best part
about canned cranberry sauce Brigitte
there's you got these like ridges from
the can I show you want to cut it yeah
it's awesome
so Brizzy wants a mixer fit cuts and
thin cuts so we're doing of course
there's only one person eating the
cranberry sauce and that's the microbes
that eat it when it gets left out but
okay um I love it and your dad loves it
no you don't okay oh man it's falling
apart oh okay here you go
that's first time I've ever eaten it's
so good I day to eat at UNK she had to
eat it out of my hand like an animal
good i fried away my but earlier keeping
very sauce I really did you taste it my
I gave myself a prostate exam
