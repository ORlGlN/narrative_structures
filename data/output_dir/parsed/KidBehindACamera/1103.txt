I'll skin blue that pictures I picture
the Vietnam War right there oh yeah yes
Vietnam
isn't having a home sweet home want oh
it's done
this is that's Vietnam no it's not the
Crimean War as be no more no look at
their hat
that's nice neat that's why I'm calling
on Richard that is obviously in the 60s
no it's not hitting maybe the maybe the
1860s see you trying to make me think
that's like some older war no I never
heard the the poems the charge of the
Light Brigade yeah that's from Vietnam
charge the Light Brigade the Vietnamese
were running around with lights and
that's how we found them inside Obama no
no it was written by a poet almost like
a truffle or Emerson that's ones
eighteen signals that could be from well
that's World War two that's Iwo Jima
no that's 1862 100 you're a trip the
Russians about the Vietnamese both the
Russians and Turks had all kinds of
cannons okay they were the British were
doomed they figured they'd never make it
across this valley
so Emerson wrote this poem but the
charge the Light Brigade in the valley
of the death rode the six hundred
well the officer at the beginning here
said we will ride so fast they will not
be able to just the cannons quick enough
to hit us and that's what they did they
wrote across the field so fast that they
couldn't adjust the artillery him and
they made it all across the field a lot
of them died but they took over the
other side of the field and took out all
the cannons because that would happen in
Vietnam oh that's crazy that's variant
it is called the charge of the Light
Brigade it's a I think it's Rolfe Lord
Everson wrote the poem but he can't tell
Richard smarter than all of us
oh yeah no I bet if we play Paper
Scissors he know whom to choose before I
bought that to put up in my office that
rain weren't flying and then when I
loved her and we're funny everybody at
home well ready well yeah I bet he knows
what we're gonna choose before we do
Rock Paper Scissors shoot
oh yeah see we do paper rock scissors ah
so Rock Paper Scissors shoot
yes Rock Paper Scissors shoot he knew we
were both choosing paper some boy you're
looking for lose Rock Paper Scissors
shoot
No oh nice so nice via beneath stuff you
have here again so I had people asking
me how come dad couldn't recognize uncle
Richard when he came due to the repo
prank and the reason is is because this
is what he looked like
we never seen we never seen the family
we hadn't seen Richard since like 89 and
this is what he looked like back then so
looks like a totally different person
dad later realized it was him but by
then Richard already returned Syracuse
now I'm not gonna pretend I knew the
Light Brigade was but I knew one from
Vietnam huh and I did know the picture
from Iwo Jima because it's one of the
most historical you know photographs of
all time but I'm still gonna pretend
like I did so thanks for the history
lesson uncle Richard I appreciated it
I'll go with just the smartest person in
our family
