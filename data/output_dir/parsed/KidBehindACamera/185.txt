today I have something very unfortunate
that I have to do it's not unfortunate
it's fun Friday I'm not talking but
those of you that actually did see
yesterday's vlog I asked you to click
like if you want grandpa to cut all this
out it's definitely gonna be a fun
Friday now yeah they click like here's
the thing
no no I'm keeping this okay why why are
you so mad at how I care about this I'll
shave my beard if you cut your head bald
do you want me to cut my handphone no
but I don't want to do this either so
tell you what if you shave your beard
I won't prank you on October tell you
what I'm not shaving it and I'm pranking
you in October how about that guy
nice prank it's gonna go crazy I'm not
shaving it why don't you stop the
release of it guys today it's Friday
today this has to go we just got to stop
number one Walmart you know it's a funny
little thing we wouldn't even have to be
here at Walmart right now if Bridget and
grandpa didn't decide to cut the last
pair of clothes that we have come in a
while I'm excited to be a Walmart you're
excited to be here I'm not oh because of
the hair so had they not cut the last
clippers I wouldn't need to come get a
new pair right now Michael I'm wondering
like I think hair clippers should be tax
deductible what they should be tax
deductible I feel like this is a monthly
expense okay first of all hair clippers
are tax deductible I serious you are
buying them for the purpose of vlogging
me cut my hair that's a business
expenses I've been at H&R green okay
alright having said that just in case
it's not tax deductible
we are not like claiming these oh well
how much do you think we've spent this
year on freaking hair clippers I don't
like a business expense at this point so
monthly it's like a utility it's like
okay we got light we got cable
we've got hair clippers I know right
this one sure yeah you just need
something for your hair and beard my
beard sign just a hair and beard babe
the next step is actually finding some
shampoo that'll fix the rashes on my
head my head is all burned up you guys
from having too much hair what is this
if cuz you have dry skin guys do you
know any special hair product that I can
use for one dandruff two for horribly
dry scalp head and shoulders
this is what I need I mean for the
dandruff and then I have some good
conditioner at home for your scalp and I
hain't ordered like scout but why is my
hair gonna be so messed up what why
can't I have normal hair
you're just a dry person why I was
hoping that this would grow long and I
didn't it's just throwed out and looks
horrible just like your beard is gonna
be no my beard fine so currently looking
for shampoo for Michaels hair and scalp
yeah okay
Oh Michael you can get this one for your
mange I don't have main you have Mane's
under your hair no I don't have mange I
just got patches missing everywhere
that doesn't make it may Michael just
freakin shave I miss pickle baby it's
tougher for a memes it was like light
shampoo dryness and it's really yes I
know what my shampoo smells like believe
is I thought it's like a cool like like
great scent like an ocean breeze or
something okay I have a good idea let's
just get like hadn't shoulders that is
like amazing for mange and then I could
put like my face moisturizer on here let
me mange stop it all right you're messed
up Scout it just got takes takes yeah
you got leave in Walmart on the way to
grandpa's I just want to go ahead and
let it be known right now that if my
eyebrows go there's going to be so many
because yeah you seem to always do
I've lost my eyebrows so many times I
can't even keep count anymore to one
maybe twice okay so what see like you
said third time's the charm
I'm tired of losing my eyebrows not
losing them again let's go to grandpa's
where I can lose this Carla ground rules
before we start cutting man rule no
there's couple of new rules I country in
