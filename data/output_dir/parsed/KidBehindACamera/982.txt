surefire way to make sure it does not
hurt you is you have to chew us about
the place you get it I think the least
painful place you can get a tattoo

your neck or this area or the top of
your foot those are the two places that
you don't even feel it
why was my foot so not here no so the
top of your foot because you won't even
feel that one at all it's it's such that

they'll get you like a princess thing
