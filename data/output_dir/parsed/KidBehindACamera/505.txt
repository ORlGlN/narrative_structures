call me Oh I didn't thought you've been
doing that here I'll turn it was hot
well we're back home ah I've been home
for a little while now
I just been trying to digest all this
bullshit you know
when I did the prank - dad my intentions
weren't to make him feel old the
intention was one he doesn't think he's
old because he's told me himself that
he's in the best shape of his life and
two he feels younger than he ever has so
he's using it as an excuse so I was
trying to force him to stop using the
excuse and all of it was piss him off
because he thought I was calling him old
so it was literally a joke yeah it
wasn't even really a prank it was just a
joke and he just flipped out and he
busted up his frickin chandelier and so
tomorrow dad and I are gonna go check
around maybe get him a new one yeah I
mean that is dangerous yeah you started
Safari it's sort of smoking yes
smoking sparking ridiculous dad so he
freaked out I told you guys last week I
think he's getting angrier again because
he's been too nice for too long and you
can usually tell when he starts to get
that in him that is starting to boil
over and it's been happening it's
getting worse I don't know if it's over
I don't know if that was as bad as it
gets
he's been freaking out maybe it's cause
of holidays
he hates holidays yeah he literally
hates holidays I don't know
dad calm the hell down nobody called you
freaking old but you haven't also say
well that's gonna be a fair day guys
thanks for watching nothing that was
insane not what I expected um anyway is
this your new intro spot I don't know
it's just where I gravitated to I don't
know like it or not
I think I do like it I just go to a
place I don't know I'm gonna get out of
here thanks for watching you guys like
subscribe baby fun everything we just
imagine I love you guys
