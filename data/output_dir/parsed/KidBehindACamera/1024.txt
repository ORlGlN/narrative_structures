okay well I like the game but it is
super hard so if you don't know what
this game is it is a zombie game so
basically a free roam game where you're
living with zombies the thing is you
don't want to be caught outside at night
because there are these monsters that if
they see they all just start piling up
on you it's it's freaking terrifying
dude
should I give this fucked up infected
motherfucker with jazz hands now just
put a bunch of toxic snot at me
so as you can see the graphics are
actually pretty good
of course I gotta worry about this damn
guy so I'm stuck on this game right now
uh I got to get into a locker or
something I don't know how to pick locks
there's this dude walking around with a
freaking gigantic hammer or a wrench or
whatever he's hitting me with but the
worst part is to go out at night I'm
going to go ahead and wait till it gets
tonight I'm going to show you this stuff
because it is terrifying all right so
it's night
I'm just going to go around here and see
what is down to you
