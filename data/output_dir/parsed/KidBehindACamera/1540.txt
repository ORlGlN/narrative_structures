what's going on you guys I'm whispering
right now it is about 1:40 in the
morning I'm feeling much better
I've had the flu for the past couple
days still trying to talk a little low
because Bridget now has it I don't want
to wake her up I'm just going to take
the camera in here for a minute
Oh
your wake
hey Bill
I'm just telling everyone get the flu
now it's my fault and it's my fault my
fault
I never meant to give you the flu girl
I'm sorry all right night-night bill nah
I mean I can't I'm busy
smells like you ain't laying down no way
come on spot so she has the flu and let
me show you what the house looks like
right now
this is the apartment right now
that's right we're living like slobs
this is our life whilst we live with the
blue so I'm gonna clean it
that's it for the shaky leg syndrome
beside effective shitting out your brain
think about all those happy sad bills
what pissing billions of dumb drain well
I still take them
I can waste and I'm still speaking out
but for send them on deck
they shine
you
this is the prescription of prescription
medicine but I can't do a little
now I can get a value through them now
they're gonna share but smell your lousy
weeds no that's a lie you
you fucking lied ah
endless trains and I love
I think that I might a quasi get over on
my break
that's an anxiety attack ruffled by
propaganda from a snake jump into the
kids then brainwash their heads genocide
with a sugar coating well I
and one
that I wasted
I'm sorry
dosing up on board all
a generation and I'm done okay so I know
it's not the best but Jesus Christ I'm a
fucking man okay the dishes I'm still
doing I got a load in there right now
that was started because that's what I
do afterwards
here comes Bella regardless it's better
than it was so you better soon Bridget
and I'm tired I'm going to bed maybe
I'll sleep right there
so I don't catch what Bridget has even
though she caught it for me
