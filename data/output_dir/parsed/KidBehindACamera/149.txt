for you
Jennifer whoever I have been in search
for that Ouija board
better not be yeah that's what I'm
asking you about and it better not be
I'm wondering if the Ouija board is here
because it's not a house anywhere
I'm thinking maybe like Jennifer when
she was cleaning the pool house maybe
she grabbed it brought it here it's just
a piece of Ouija board
yeah what was that what are you boy huh
we're waiting game I guess the Ouija
board hereby when you clean up the whole
house we couldn't find the Ouija we
can't find that Ouija board won't be
here no it's not so it's not here
should I get your house or it could be
here here's something ever
I don't recall like doing anything with
it dude how many of these is it it's
like this big it's the corner that shows
like the Sun or the moon or something oh
god it didn't burn yeah that's why I
said the whole water fire that wouldn't
burn that's the only part that wouldn't
burn you need to find it why are you so
upset I don't want it here huh they give
you things here I think you brought it
over here to fire it it's not here fire

here dad I'm tired of battling as much
as you are man I'm ready good luck
you know anybody's noticed ever since we
started having like messing with the
Ouija board but yo YouTube stop sending
out push notification so that's bad luck
on us what that mean it means people
don't get notified when they well
basically the sky named honor the call
has discovered it basically what's
happening on YouTube if you have
anything that you're made of data tags
thumbnail title and there's anything
that they think might be offensive
they're not gonna send it out to all
your subscribers
yeah that's YouTube man you gotta play
ball gotta respect it cheering that's
good good
oh my goodness something each morning

Weiser part I'm joking
