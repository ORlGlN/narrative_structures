burning the fucking clothes I took a
shower when we got back I was like I
don't know what was going on
what else would it have been I'm sorry
bodily Oh God okay forget it

so last night was SummerSlam and I want
to show everybody our chair what is this
that's the poster that they were giving
out after oh yeah like a free poster I
got one for the girl I wouldn't open it
you don't want to ruin it for them yeah
you got it for my daughters so this is
our chair the newest to my collection oh
here it is
wow that's sick Summer Slam it was
awesome yeah amazing show I was like I
don't know I was feeling a little queasy
there when Randy hurt and started
bleeding all over the mat yeah Radio
arts are spraying blood I was literally
sweating in there it started getting bad
I had to put my hair up I'm like this
ain't gonna be good but I made it on TV
for SummerSlam yeah Kim was like him too
Kim saw the cameras filming her and she
was like oh okay but no here's the
strangest thing anytime you see like
wrestling events ever when they're
showing the commentators and there's a
camera there everybody behind them is
usually going insane but nobody was so I
couldn't I'm thinking are they actually
like filming something or is it like a
commercial type of thing like what are
they doing and I'm like well I'm not
taking the chances hi SummerSlam so I
made my way on TV though ladies and
gentlemen Kim made her national
television debut actually I I was on NXT
too and if we go way back in the day to
the WWE at um the Carolina Stadium
we're front row for that are they ever
gonna put that on the network yes there
it is yes on there what when did they
finally put it on we've been looking for
this for add you notice Matt you go to
SmackDown go to 2002 and go to
November's to Thanksgiving she didn't
have it on there last time we there I've
watched it twice really damn you and you
didn't tell me see did you knew not if
you don't tell me because I was
searching with him SummerSlam cheer
let's ignore him you yeah this is
bullshit I'm Matt well the past several
days we have been filming as we've been
attending wrestling
