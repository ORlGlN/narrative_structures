what's going on you guys kid beyond the
camera here nobody right there because
nobody else is awake and today is Monday
but you've seen this on Tuesday when
I've already been home but this is just
the intro today is Monday and today
we're going to Monday Night Raw and I
don't know what kind of footage I'm
gonna get I think I'm just gonna go
straight from this to mine I don't know
usually I find myself not able to film
during the day because my camera died so
freakin quick but anyway today is Monday
today I'm going to Monday Night Raw and
today me and Kim are gonna go mail my
chairs from SummerSlam because I don't
want to check in his luggage I hate
having to check my chairs as luggage
because one I feel like somebody's gonna
steal it maybe that's just me being
stupid but I feel like it's valuable so
my brain is mush today it just occurred
to me Kim's actually outside smoking
right now she a minute ago I said I'm
the only one awake
Kim's awake she's outside smoking a
cigarette so I'm a liar folks
Kim's awake so anyway today's Monday
today we're mailing our chairs and then
going to raw and tomorrow I'm going home
I'm going home anyway let's get this
Monday started whenever style sorry just
for a second
this person Oh laid on the horn like a
solid minute I got some of it
darn it I was trying to get my camera I
wanna know how to do it again they were
they were relent I'm just trying to get
my camera out in time for that I was
listening okay they're not getting off
but I'm gonna record that so many people
blow their horn hairs if it's gonna make
a difference you know like you usually
got you know you got to blow the horn at
like 50 people ahead well at that time
didn't make a difference but sometimes
people are stopping for no reason
ah to just check something and then the
driving selfish
well doesn't help this year about
somebody behind ah people are crazy
respectful if it's shopping and
everybody's here it is Kim
just got to ship out our chairs the
other chairs we're going to ship them

it was a lot of fun it was a good time
so we're going home today
Kim's going home she's not seeing her
girls because they're at Niagara Falls
contest' ah my alarms off I gotta go
wake up hold on hey wake up
so I have a question I've been seeing
this mirror this whole time we've been
here so you see it I see it
since the minute we walked in so I we
haven't addresses with each other yet
but we could already know we're getting
it yeah I know what you're gonna say
does that not remind you of Tetris isn't
that crazy
yeah that mess that's what you were
thinking I know so this is so Tetris
right there and they're there does
anybody else see this yeah I know who's
a mistake I'm not saying the hotel did
this on purpose all they did was buy a
mirror but it definitely has a real
Louden are we allowed to even say the
word I don't think we're allowed to say
it so I'm just going to say do you see
some sort of symbol from the 40s
uh in this mirror around there I would
say yes holy crap this had to be a
mistake I think once you see that you
can't unsee it so this fucked up
definitely agree sorry my voice is
definitely hoarse from days of wrestling
and cheering I think I've learned my
lesson no more well what really happened
is she blew a homeless dude next to a
hotdog cart
last night you know I have a big heart I
felt bad music I want my Nick suit he
was like come here sir it was the mom in
her the least I can do I don't have
bills on me no change so he's thinking
there was another one he was just like
singing like Ashley Simpson percision me
I think it was like come here Sarah I'll
take a piece of you toe in her mouth and
she swallowed
oh my god and now that now the hotel
took a piece of him while he told me he
came from the M&M store
would melt in my mouth and not in my
hand so you're tardy being clever you
won't take your road

the AL figured out they figured out that

was covering it up and I'm sure they
figure something else out
hmm every time I'm in a vlog with some
guy anywhere at Royal Rumble I was with
TJ and everyone said that I was totally
GG Jim's fucking TJ and I felt bad
because his wife was pregnant ready
