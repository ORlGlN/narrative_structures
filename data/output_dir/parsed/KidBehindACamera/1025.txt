what's going on you guys kick me out of
camera here bridge West here
and first things first I've had a cold
since I got back from Philadelphia and
today I wouldn't got some medicine for
it
they're giving me amoxicillin man good
luck with that so I wanted Bridget to
film this because I already have a hard
time taking pills now I've got to take
this fucking horse pill so wish me
elected look at this that's crazy so
this sounds like a bumblebee that would
be flying around my head
all right down good job you guys think
that twice a day what oh you got to be
joking
nope man so anyway we got some bad news
if we're gonna have to talk about it and
it's sad Bella is sick
Bridget both hands that's fine she has a
little lump on her wrist we noticed it
we might have actually talked about it
on vlog like months ago I thought it had
always been there Bridget wasn't sure if
it had been there when we were at the
vet we got it tested and it is a tumor
on Bella and tomorrow she is having
surgery to get it removed yeah it's just
to be at the vet at 8:20 a.m. that's not
long after I go to bed so I'm gonna have
to miss the appointment bridge is gonna
be vlogging I I don't know I might be
too sad um it sucks
Bella needs to get surgery to have a
tumor removed from her wrist and it
sucks you know because uh it's hard
putting dogs under anesthesia she has to
be put to sleep not all dogs are real
successful with it so it's a scary
procedure but it's got to be done
because he could turn into worse the
doctor yeah they can attach to her her
bones it hasn't got it when we did the
x-ray a couple of days ago the tumor
hadn't been attached to anything it was
just like sitting outside of her arm
and so he said it's a good idea to get
it removed after they had a test and he
tested it it was a tumor
it's got to be removed so that's the
update that's the bad news
Bella has to get surgery tomorrow
so what's just luck I really hope it
goes well it's gonna be fine it'll be
fine but in the off chance hey big girl
okay so here it is the little growth on
Bella a little blurry right now you can
see there's a little lump on her wrist
it's hard as a rock
poor little thing could that have been
why she was limping that day you know
well we're gonna get y'all taking care
of girl tomorrow is the day so I'll know
by the time I wake up how it went but
that's tomorrow you'll be okay Bella
okay she better be okay she's gonna be
just fine she's a big strong girl uh-huh
