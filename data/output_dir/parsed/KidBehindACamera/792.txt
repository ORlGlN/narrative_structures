video it's a cooking video those so
weird uh yes so he doesn't want to talk
to me but he drops off a cooking video
so I can upload it to his channel oh my
god I am huh and I guess he's made
making barbecue sauce this is like
boring even like on top of meat and
stuff this good thing this looks like
one of those horrifying things I've ever
seen a little girl
this is trailer-park barbecue sauce whoo
grandpa was here and he dropped off
frickin cooking videos oh how long he
was here without saying something what
do you think I think it was a little
weird it was a weird approach to me that
doesn't happen to me it's sort of like
burst a bubble
I guess that like we could have this
good time all week without him you know
me I forgot oh there's no problems with
Grandpa and then he shows up and reminds
me there's problems yeah really
like I'm waiting from the burst in and
tear up the tree or that's not gonna
happen or burst into the telescope or
not gonna happen I was him this really
puts a damper on shit he's not answering
he's so weird that was so weird text um
I've already texted like freaking 2010
names well ignore it you know me dude am
i freaking not a hypercar jet what sort
of pessimistic
yeah I'm paranoid so it was weird what
is he up to
probably nothing is what I doing it on
purpose freak you are I already feel
like we're gonna argue or maybe he just
doesn't want to see you so he just
dropped it off that makes me feel better
