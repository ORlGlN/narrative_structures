I know chill about there's too much
weird stuff going on Michael I swear
it's not a prank
our house is really haunted something
weird happened let's put the camera down
and let's finish cleaning up this mess
and then we should tell grandpa what's
going on
talk about what talk about this know
something else I think yeah I think you
already know is your idea right what the
prank today is doing on me there is no
prank Michael is it not the weirdest
that is really strange Michael last
night we kept trying to turn this on and
it wouldn't turn on it would not turn on
I changed new batteries turned on came
in here to go up there to look right and
the upstairs wind turn on like it's
where it's people sent me a whole bunch
of stuff and that's actually included in
it people are telling me number one that
it could be a demon and the reason that
is is because when demons make
themselves apparent they always come in
three so I like an white three knocks no
poultry goes do that is it - poltergeist
the demon
no what is the polar guys don't you get
it super fun why do mischief so they're
evil
oh yeah they can be evil well what I
read somebody sent me Doug is that demon
knocks like three times and for instance
when the thing came down now we heard a
loud bang
that coming down we heard a loud bang
which means it closed yeah which means
it opened after that when we saw it
which means it had to open close open
and the stayed open that's three
don't say that that's three so do we
have a culture guys no I think it's a
demon my cleaners poultry guys now they
also said that demons can mimic like our
voices and stuff now you remember that
clip alias investigations link I don't
know what this is that kind of sounded
like me saying Mike listen Mike that
sounds like me but first of all why
would I say Mike yeah why would you say
I'm wrapping stuff Mike there's no
reason for me to do that but it sounds
like my voice yeah so they can mimic
your voice Mike now one night and I
wasn't gonna tell you this don't tell me
I can't take it I woke up in the middle
of the night and I heard you saying come
here Nate didn't listen to me I swear I
was like oh man you know it was like two
3:30 in the morning okay I go out to
find Bridget and I'm like where are you
just says come here and I don't see you
I come back you're asleep don't say that
right
nice puncture guys it's not demon demon
wood position it could also be like I
was half asleep and I thought I was
hearing yeah sure thing pal
so knocking threes replicate our voices
they kill batteries to electronics we
can have a demon or a poltergeist I'm
going to poach your guys because they're
messing with us playing games yeah I
think they're playing games yeah like
you remember all those times you could
not find your wallet what if the
poltergeist was hiding it cuz it those
things hide things right he goes you
know everyone's saying that we might
have let loose a demon by playing with
the freaking like Ouija board
oh so we need to find that thing
should we look for the Ouija board yes
I've been telling you guys smart for us
to find the Ouija board done and bury it
you better have
kosher salt will just leave you in
charge with all that should we go say
Jim kosher salt
should we go looking yes we should find
this thing before it's too late
burn your sage put ashes in the hole
ashes sprinkled of salt
what kind of ashes from the sage well
first we're gonna have to find it oh my
god it's not just working so is it is
this thing like right by you listening
to the conversation
could be what oh my gosh okay hold on
I'm not joking I'm leaving the house oh
my god me too I I kind of wants you now
okay not even remotely kidding well if
it's right here Doug do this
do the scan real quick just see if we
catch anything you know how hit this
hold the Scan button all right is there
a demon in here
there's our poltergeist
we should ask you a question
how old am I that's it this is
absolutely it we need to stop now
so ask any questions you just turn it
off we gotta say bye we gotta say bye
wouldn't we invite it in dude
let's keep the blue one top or bottom
both a super log didn't it help words
you ask me this every time
well you have a hard time unlocking
doors Oh watch this you were saying okay
so oh what the light I believe it bro oh

it's probably look short yeah sure thing
Doug is there anything such thing as a
short and wiring I can flip a switch no
yeah then why would that keep me turned
on don't know look let's just find the
Ouija board okay yeah now wait a minute
didn't we put it up here no it was taken
down and they set it right here
well the word is it formats I don't know
if somebody had to take it I really hope
not
but if they took it then why is it like
messing with us still hmm probably cuz
you messed up here I don't know what
does that mean well I told you you
probably shouldn't use a Ouija board
ever you're like this is just a game
it's just a game it was just a game well
we're paying for it now it no we're not
it seems they don't know what this is
it just it has to be here I didn't throw
it out I do Chris was messing around I'm
here what if he took it I doubt it
I did we came over and cleaned it yeah I
mean I could ask her how things in here
I was cute like a check this bag or some
things I'm gonna dick the garbage I
don't blame you Doug peek in that bag
see if it's in there maybe we should
probably throw that out actually what
