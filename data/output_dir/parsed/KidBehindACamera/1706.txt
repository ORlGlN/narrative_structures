I didn't make a Happy New Year video
because my energy was just gone
I stayed up all fucking day and night
working on that damn here and review it
took a long time so that's why didn't
make a video but here are some
highlights from our New Year's Eve just

face what Bridget you really fine I'm
gonna hold it no more good I'll go next

Year

neighbors hate us so Happy New Year I
guess oh if you guys haven't played it
yet I suggest getting sawed free ex for
the Xbox 360 honestly I have very low
expectations when it comes to a video
game made from a movie I don't like them
when they do it they always fail this I
really liked it's it's sort of like it's
like manhunt
