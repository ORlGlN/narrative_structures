tastes like have you ever had it would
like kind of hard to explain with like I
don't know okay I've had like a fridge
where the water thing is like going out

Michael I'd say was bad the best
ingredient that you could get for your
tacos at home everybody or whatever it
isn't because it's not tacos is business
you never put beats and tacos I hate
these yes we're doing this instead of
tomato now we're not maybe you can force
