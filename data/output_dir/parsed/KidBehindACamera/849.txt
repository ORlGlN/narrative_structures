we don't have any air conditioning again
hot kid behind the camera here and I
don't mean physically all right I'm not
attractive I'm burning up you are a
check though so this is now the third
time and I is it is it weird that the
air conditioning has gone out once again
after we have an argument with dad I
find it weird honestly if Dad had
something our air conditioning is out
again I mean he lied about the phone I
could see him destroying our air okay
let's just address that so dad told me
that he burned up his phone in the tent
or I burned up his phone in the tent and
that was bullshit
thanks to Bridget and thanks to Twitter
look at this the phone is right there
the phone is in his fucking hand and how
did I not see it that's the thing it was
right there how did I not know you're
blind and partially stupid obviously I
mean the phone was right there dad dad I
know what to do because he forgot dad I
know it's rub - this is now the second
time you've tried to get a free phone
out of me the first time you said it
because poor waterfront buffoon
Noah didn't now your burned my phone
lieutenant do you just want a new phone
it no where's his van that's the
question
it's in a swamp somewhere probably is
where is the van because you know he's
lying about it's a definite lie but he
doesn't have it but then again he
doesn't want to do us with nothing to do
with us all week we can't go over all
week which means that we don't have to
take him to appointments all week which
means he has a van so anyway we're gonna
get this Monday started dad I know what
you did but I'm gonna leave you alone
