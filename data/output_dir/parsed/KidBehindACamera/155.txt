oh my god that's not that's not the
right one
what what happened it's gonna blow up we
got him you just ruin it I thought of
what you said this doesn't throw you
want
what's going on you guys give me on a
camera here
Bridget just texted me a picture I
actually come outside see it myself that
is five crows what does it mean trying
to look at what it means right now you
know this happened last time okay
seeing just a single crows considered an
omen of bad luck finding two crows
however means good luck
three crows means health four crows
means wealth yet spotting five crows
means sickness is coming six means death
that's five crows but I saw four you saw
five oh they're gone where'd they go oh
man they presented themselves and they
disappeared so you saw four I saw five
which means wealth is coming to you
sickness is coming to me don't say it so
I'm gonna get sick and you're gonna give
my bank account from it no it's just
crows it means nothing guys let's go do
this intro okay medicine let's go what's
going on you guys keep you out of camera
here it is here right there and today is
Monday Monday guys I want to talk about
anything else right now all I want to
talk about are the crows because that's
the only thing running through my mind
right now you guys you just saw we
walked outside and the crows just like
last time to hook the crows
circling and hunting us and the crows
will not go away and I'm tired of it
well I stopped four crows and I'm happy
with well I saw five and I'm not five is
sickness four is wealth so what's gonna
happen why do I get sick and you get
wealthy suddenly what does that mean
don't say it it's probably not true
anyway guys I just don't like dabbling
in this stuff anymore if you didn't see
yesterday's vlog we found footprints in
our driveway and I don't know where they
go to and that's freaking me out now
we're seeing crows that's freaking me
out we had all the stuff last week that
I've been trying to get over but that's
not getting any better it's just like
getting worse and scarier and I don't
like it

you guys we got to leave the house right
now because Jennifer is broken down at
checkers and what is that what are these

okay first look like we saw like the
spirit of a kid watching into our house
then Doug said there were footprints of
like a child like size 8 in the Attic
then child like bare footprints in our
driveway and now sucks I feel like it's
a prank like it has to be gate shut it
has to be some kind of a prank at this
point okay like this is getting
ridiculous anyway right now jennifer is
at checkers and she's totally broken
down and I don't know if she needs gas
or like a tire or a jump I don't know
what she needs
