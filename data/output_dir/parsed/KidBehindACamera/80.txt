my gosh

oh I'm sorry that it's the saddest movie
you've ever seen no you don't do it I'm
play Friday 13 before I get out of here
you guys want to take a minute just uh
talk about stuff about everything that's
been happening over the last day number
one I want to let you guys know what
would happen to you if you make a video
about Logan Paul this is what you can
expect to happen if you make a video
about their hero so if you're not aware
I made a video yesterday where I was
addressing the fact that Logan Paul went
into the Japanese suicide forest as they
call it
and they found somebody who had
committed suicide and he filmed him for
his vlog and he put it in the vlog he
thought that was okay to film and so I
decided to give my opinion on it because
that actually affects me now usually I
don't get involved in that stuff you
know that if it doesn't affect me I
don't care
do your thing enjoy I usually won't
criticize you for it but this affects me
because this can trigger a new ad
pocalypse and I rely on this platform to
make money for my family you know there
are people who were criticizing me on
Twitter like oh go
who Logan Paul talked about it you know
you've talked about your dad dying for
the past since Christmas why can't Logan
Paul show his dead body well because
it's not the same thing okay
did I monetize videos after my father
passed absolutely did i monetize his
tribute video absolutely did i monetize
my speech for him at the funeral
absolutely and the reason that I did
those things is because I still have a
family that I support with my youtube
channel this was part of dads plan dad
told me two years ago that if anything
were to ever happen to him he wants us
to continue doing YouTube because that's
what provides for our entire family and
just because he's gone doesn't mean that
I don't provide for my entire family
still I still provide for my family I
pay for my mom's life I pay for like my
nephews my said I I am the breadwinner
for my family and yeah I monetized
videos when my father passed because
bills don't stop coming in it's the same
reason I told boogy monetize the video
about my desk the reason I told
mcjuggernuggets keemstar dame drops
anybody who wanted to make a video about
my father and talking about him
by all means monetize it because dad was
a youtuber and he understood this
platform and he understood that this is
how you make a living so it's not the
same thing and if you think that it is
then there's a piece of brain that's
actually missing to think that what I
did making money to provide for my
family by discussing the passing of my
father is the same as exploiting
somebody who died okay number one it was
my family number two it wasn't his
family you can't just go into the woods
finding somebody who died and I think
that he wanted to find somebody why else
would you go to the suicide for us you
go to the suicide forest because you
want to see somebody who committed
suicide it's the only reason you would
going oh we're going to go check
to the suicide forest I sure hope we
don't see somebody he wanted to see
somebody he saw somebody he got excited
and he put it on vlog and he shouldn't
have and it was a mistake and his
apologies didn't really explain enough
that he was sorry because nobody
believed it and I wanted to offer my
opinion on that because I thought that
he should have done it and he agrees
that he shouldn't have done it
however his fans do not agree so really
fast we're doing the outro on a second
here's some things that you can expect
from the fans of Logan fall if you
decide to make a video about this
subject number one they are going to
give you death threats number two
they're going to give you death threats
and number three they're going to think
that they have the power to carry out
those death threats and those death
threats are very scary okay when you see
some like ten-year-old kid weren't a
maverick shirt saying like I'm going to
murder you I take it very seriously okay
drive safe it's gonna be snowing
tomorrow or ask your mom to drive safe
hey I can't drive either guys we're
doing the outro in just a second I just
wanted to let you know that's when it's
like talking about Logan Paul his fans
will hate you at the same time I had to
say something okay and I like looking
Paul I don't just like him I really like
his content just somebody needed to say
it and a couple of people have and I'm
gonna be one to say it too because this
affects me guys let's do this outro well
that's gonna be it for today you guys
