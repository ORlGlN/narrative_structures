so Bridget called me while I was at what
grampa today and she told me she's going
to Walmart and she'll be back at the
house in about an hour she wasn't
expecting me home for about another two
hours so I got here early I'm waiting
for her and I'm gonna scare the shit out
of her when she walks into the door
yo what are you doing yeah what are you
doing but you know what I had that bring
me home they would calm down
you're not leaving you go anywhere I was
joking
