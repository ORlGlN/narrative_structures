okay kid behind a camera Here I am
investigating the ghost sighting
everybody saw at our house today had to
be a ghost right first I don't believe
in ghosts I don't believe in God I don't
know what it was my cat or something I
don't know but we're going to
investigate first car Here I am at the
trash can
okay
the head was here of course it was less
filled with garbage at that point
so there's no ghosts as I lift up the
lid there's lots of garbage so that's
where y'all right now lots of garbage no
ghosts I'm not gonna stop looking yet
okay
we are at the shed
you first I'm afraid to open this thing
cuz it might be a possum I really don't
want the little fuzzy
okay I'm gonna speak to the ghost maybe
catch one on film if there's any ghosts
in here who think the car there's any
ghosts in here make your presence known
now
okay inside the shed
there's got to be some kind of a naman
here
okay so
halfway in a shed
and there's a possum something there's
and there's no ghost there's probably a
possum somewhere heard it rattling
around so there's a possum but no ghosts
yet we're going to keep searching around
the house fuck that possible once in so
we're going to keep moving up from here
for no reason I'm gonna put the light
back on this time I left the door open
you check behind the shed
that opening
I'm not gonna stay on a very long um
there's no ghosts so
he's kidding
fuck what Tyron I really need to get you
back was that you the shed yeah man in
you laughs okay all you want to do this
I'm not gonna lie she got me that wasn't
even right that really just I was scared
ha ha ha I was questioning the the
ideals of ghosts she got me
