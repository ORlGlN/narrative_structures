what's going on you guys can't be at a
camera here are you Lester here if
you're wondering why were whisperings
because Clyde he is sleeping this is how
quite likes to sleep oh what's de love I
was messed up no squirrel my baby
is so adorable
what a Bella wake you will he was
sleeping cute perfect
I'm in it there I get out your face I
promise
keep the hell away from me oh I just
woke up and the first thing that I
wanted to mention is the reason I didn't
make a vlog yesterday was because I was
working on the montage for the cold
water challenge I think it turned out
pretty good I'm gonna put it in
tomorrow's video so look out for
tomorrow I'm gonna have my montage for
your cold water challenges and it's
pretty cool that you guys did it so you
guys will see that tomorrow my eye has
been twitching today right there and
then do it yet but I don't know I'm just
sitting here I can't figure it out so
knowing the shit out of me he's been
doing this yesterday there it is
I looked up some stuff they said it
could be fatigue they said I can have
dry eyes that can be stressed out I
don't know not stressed out I had a
pretty good sleep I would say last night
oh you can think of his dry eyes but
then I put some liquid in there and it
still did it
so I don't know I don't know what the
problem is it's frustrating it's been
since yesterday now somebody's doing it
all the time but every 10 minutes or so
it does it and that's annoying that's
good on my nerves
cultural dim twitching I've had a lot of
people asking me what I think about all
the reveals going on at the e3
conference and honestly I'm not that
impressed it is not that I'm not
impressed by the graphics because I am I
just have a major problem with video
games revealing debut trailers for video
games that don't look like the trailer
you always have video games with
cutscene trailers that they make that
they render just for the trailer and the
game looks nothing like it when you play
it Dead Island 2 everybody's freaking
out because you know it looks amazing
this guy jogging on the street and
they're zombies attacking everybody in
the background but they did the same
thing for the last Dead Island game they
did this big reveal trailer where
everything was going in Reverse and you
can see all this crazy shit happening
and then you play the game and you like
yeah this graphics suck so my problem is
when these video games render trailers
to get you excited about a game and the
game is nothing like the trailer and I
know graphics aren't everything but
don't show us this amazing footage and
then not give us you know something
