what's going on you guys keep you any
camera here I know I promised you guys a
blog about grandpa getting kicked out of
show knees but Bella is going to the vet
right now so I couldn't have time to do
it hey Bella so yeah I'm not the door
right now

worry baby
I just want to point out that Bridget
has copied me yeah yeah and God my exact
shirt from t-shirt hell I guess I'm the
coolest person she knows yeah Kurt can't
we so just so you know the reason we're
taking Bella to the vet is I don't know
is Maura she's been more off like what
would you say Bridget depressed you
would say she's sort of laying around
yes usually runs around in place with
toys and drinks water and shit all day
today she's just sort of chilling on the
floor and just mopey and walks over to
her cage and just lays and end are you
doing back there baby
we got the arrow for you
so we're gonna take her enough fat and
get her all good should be all better
so he's like me sitting in the backseat
so that's what's happening right now
hopefully she gets back to war itself at
least find out if there's something
wrong at all but there might not be
anything wrong could be overreacting
Oh Michael idea this this time it was my
idea that's my dog I don't care if lazy
goes with the better not yeah I'm just
joking I forgive you it was my idea this
time to take her to the vet I want her
to tell my baby every kitchen

car all right well I'll update you again
at the bench

little bit and I'm starting to smell now
I can see below to help so we just got
news that how about that she is obese
she's too fat for her weight she has 64
pounds other than that she's healthy and
nothing is wrong nothing's wrong
probably nothing no you bailed you like
got there you like it with you so that's
the update for now we will talk to you
give probably in the car so Bella is
healthy for now we think we're gonna be
getting her spayed here pretty soon
we're operating our dog okay so we are
now on our way home from the vet
