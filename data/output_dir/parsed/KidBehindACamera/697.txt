camera here vigil SDI right there and
today is Monday a lot of you may know by
now by watching the video we did with
keemstar and dramaalert
that yesterday it all came out that we
were being extorted and blackmailed uh
by somebody who at one point dad thought
was a friend and then later started
blackmailing us back in August and I
just wanted to take a moment to you know
express how appreciative we are how cool
you guys have been with us about all
this and the support and the love and
it's been absolutely amazing to see how
many people would come together in
support of some old man and his fat son
you know and his girlfriend annoying
girlfriend his stupid annoying girl
funny we just want to film their lives
and entertain you guys as much as we can
and the support has been so amazing and
I just want to thank you guys I wanted
to thank team
keemstar for helping us get this out for
for giving us a voice because I really
feel like because of the stigma our
videos create you know we're trash we
break things that people wouldn't take
it seriously and not want to hear what
we have to say and for him to give us a
voice I really appreciate it man

because of you and all you guys so

say on the situation so thank you guys

having wood chips in it because it has a
hundred percent graded or munchies

graded they're just saying this 100%
graded they grate the wood oh my gosh
