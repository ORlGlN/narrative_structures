hope he's not a nosy person because
there's a lot of shit Landor let me tell
you something he taking that helmet off
in history - we are making spaghetti and
meatball how do you know like that's
kind of cheating it was not spaghetti
look okay I don't know terms I don't
know the names of foods
I just know I eat in gained weight okay

cactus pear

I don't know what it is and I don't like
it we're home we've a bagged the stuff
and we're going to make some spaghetti
and I wish your dad could be with us to
eat but your dad's not with us because
he's in a virtual world what you're that
I don't I don't think so yeah
guess you can't be scared good
holy shit oh look here you can't come
this is dos new life ah yeah we gotta
get we do that is nice
that wine me yay hey Michael it's not
it's on the next thing that we're gonna
do for our sauce now I'm sure a lot of
you guys have heard of vodka sauce
before vodka sauce is you know sauce
with like a cream element and vodka and
we're not doing that today our next step
is just regular sauce which means
everything that I just did was pointless
so right now Brigitte is cooking the
spaghetti I mean I hope this sauce is
good so here's the sauce we got it says
Michael's of Brooklyn homestyle gravy
you can't get it open
geez yeah here I'm done cooking here
you're ready get you give up like your
dad dude so reddit era you know what
you're one to talk
freaking meats gonna burn hook
um thank you um let me try hey why are
you telling me something to beat it with
I bet dad can open it yeah yonas jar he
probably can't hear you hey Marjorie
yes okay so Bridget pours the sauce into
the pot i my spaghetti now the next step
for your sauce and I've already got some
started is you want to take your
meatballs now find your favorite
meatball recipe these are homemade
meatballs right now what you're going to
do is you're going to take them and put
them in the sauce raw now every time I
do it people go you can't do that but it
cooks like three hours
it's and cooks them slowly I promise you
it's cooked me so well so toss them in
for James more meatballs please did my
meatballs are homemade totally from
scratch not I don't believe in buying
people's from store it's just a pen he
says it yeah I bought his Moscow
I give up
Oh
that's it I'm good
so Doug is finished with the VR I think
when he's done with her
he's over there doing something else
step he get ready I thought he was done
he's not he's like no not yet geez Doug
there's a world around you Doug so the
next step for our spaghetti
Doug's back on the video heart the next
step for our spaghetti is some good
homemade bread now we have perfected the
art of homemade garlic bread and I want
to show you guys the first step so the
first step to a good homemade garlic
knot is uh just get the right dough down
here what's funny over there so yes they
are
and then next I'm gonna show you how to
make my homemade butternut squash
ravioli now I'm not really these are
homemade noodles enough of the homemade
virgin
oh hey Michael so I'm gonna show you
guys a trick I'm showing it before a lot
of people don't do this when it comes to
pasta now this is a shallow pot what's
funny it's funny is waiting scars so Oh
we'll be over in a second Doug so put
the pasta in the pot you just sort of
work it
got it hot forget it
just put it in so Bridgette made me feel
like an idiot just now made me look like
an idiot and I got to address it so I
told you guys a second ago that I had to
work the pasta into the pot because it
was a shallow pot this is the putt I was
talking about that Bridgette originally
had I thought it was a shallow pot no we
had the regular pot as you guys saw so I
look like a complete idiot dinner's
ready
Doug's playing VR over there so we're
gonna avoid give it out so first we get
our noodles
this is buttered noodles with a little
bit of a garlic herb and salt we're
gonna just toss some of those in there
yeah good oh yeah looks good okay
Bridget likes to add two slices of
provolone right over those noodles and
it will melt with this so we already got
us a meatball look aside that poppers
look how good that pasta meat sauce
turned out so meatballs meat sauce
looking good looks amazing
final boom you guys here's a plate of
spaghetti and he has playing meatballs
and I knows we're just plate but I'm
gonna taste it for the video looks
amazing
good good good what was he that's well
at the end of the day today man
surprisingly we were able to get Doug
off the VR and I'll be honest with you
guys I'm not entirely sure that he that
he knows he's off I think he thinks he's
making a game called spaghetti night
yeah oh my gosh
don't take the helmet off
he's lost you guys he has lost no that
is make-believe and not real so he guess
here we all have a little bit of family
dinner

will make sure that so I'm gonna get
outta here
