right here
yeah that's not hard that's why I'm
filming serious we appreciate it
team comes all the way down there yes
not moving furniture I bought myself for
days questioning if I could do it then
last night as I sat outside I set out my
dad can I do this and I looked up and
just as that time I saw a shooting star
but else this guy closed my eyes made a
wish and I picked up my phone two
regulars I wouldn't be Who I am if it
wasn't for him he taught me to be a
strong willed full pump woman who never
backs down and never takes anything from
anyone strong as I am though I must
admit that seeing my dad like that made
me feel so good to see a man that has
always been such a fierce force with
such a fight brought down so quickly
like this was heartbreaking
I do find comfort and knowing that his
pain is gone but our pain is just begun
Oh
grateful for having them in my life he
was such a stubborn man but he worked so
tirelessly family from selling his
handmade rugs to snow cones to peanuts
tonight he always found to make sure to
find a way that we had food in our
stomachs and every girl has he would
have done anything to make sure we were
taken care of and even in his last days
he wasn't concerned for himself he was
concerned for us he wasn't scared to die
he knew it was coming
he was ready he was worried about what
we were gonna do how we were gonna be we
assured him that all of us were going to
be just fine but truthfully we knew that
our world was shattered and even though
it would start to pick up the pieces one
day we always knew there'd be a large
piece missing
angry grandpas an irreplaceable
one-of-a-kind legend who paved the way
for many more Tube channels
he changed many lives and he saved many
lives I've heard numerous stories from
people who battled from depressions they
tell me how my dad saved him it always
made him feel so good and it reassured
him that what he was doing was the right
thing my dad loved his young'uns he
truly loved every single one of you so
much meant the world to him he'd call me
and he'd call me here to read me the
comments not a day will go by that I
don't think they say it gets easier but
I believe that's a lie
the pain of losing a parent can never
get easier I'll cry in the grocery store
when I see pecans no meals or peanut
butter I'll cry in the car when I hear a
song
that makes me think of him I'll cry
every year that I can't call him and
tell them happy birthday
I'll cry every year that I can't comment
on a holiday in here and it's not me he
loves me but hardest day of all that
I'll cry will be December 10th Thursday
I can only hope that when I cry he's not
out there saying
no wonder code you prep for Belton he
never wanted us to cry but we can't help
we are lucky lo thanks to the amazing
connection that Michael and our father
had we are fortunate enough to have 10
years worth of videos with a click of a
button we can go on and we can hear his
rage in his ribs forever I want to thank
Michael for taking the time and making
his life so happy
dad may have changed other people's
lives but you changed his and I'm
forever grateful you gave him something
he would have never imagined in his
wildest dreams
you made him proud and you will continue
to make him proud oh my dad may have
departed this life but his legacy will
live on forever thank you guys all of
you so much
I always have something to say please me
and dad had blowing up you know having
to raise my kids when I'm help if it
wasn't for my dad those kids I was with
hospitals
he said something the other day which I
never heard my dad say
I think how it went along the lines I
think Michael has said dad how are you
going to do this and then dad what's up
and says never doubt the Greens wisdom
there's just a lot of things that
everybody's gonna miss and it's yummy
and his family the boys are going to
miss their dad because that's what they
know it's a father day daddy took his
last breath burst out of there and we're
sitting there playing with Conway Twitty
playing all his favorite songs please
you tell doubt we said we love you we
look up for a quick second
and just like that life can be over too
so let me cherish the things you have
chairs to people you have in your life
