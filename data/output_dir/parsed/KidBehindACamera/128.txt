moment garbage a little bit what yeah a
little bit oh why would I do that I'm
leaving on universe

freezer in the table oh man come on
Michael honestly how many cups I have to
pour in the sink was a urine none okay

why do we need so many Musto's no we're
not done falling out I don't know
Michael you buy a new mustard every time
we make burgers yeah how much Buster's
just somebody like realistic we need I
don't know Michael

a lot of mustard oh my god he's on
another one just falls out I got a

close to breaking my own glasses I took
a shower to get away from this why now

to say thank you so much oh god these
pineapple Oh
why for probably oh no not the dog food
what it's lazy's i mix it with his food
what should his dog food right but he
eats it right whatever
how do I argue about this why do we like
mustard so much one of us has a mustard
obsession I think it's me I'm sort of
think it might be meaning I think
growing up one of the continents we
always had in the house was mustard so
I'd like make sure we always have
mustard so grandpa would collect for me
yes dad has an obsession collecting meat
because we didn't have meat or he didn't
have meat growing up we didn't have much
money always had must I don't care
anymore
disgusting
