what's going on you guys send you a
grandpa we took a drive after his video
just had to get out of the house we
couldn't watch the news anymore and I
don't even have to tell you really
you sure you saw it shooting what your
kids alright shut up so we'll just take
we're taking the drive up with grandpa I
just had to tie to get out of the house
you know the it's depressing watching
the news and stuff just seeing the same
video of like the kids and
well I don't know like what kind of
world were in anymore I don't know if
it's any different I don't fit was like
this in dad's day no nothing like this
but we got a 20 year old 22 22 22 year
old kid shooting kids and his parents
his mom what is this
his mom is one thing and that's sad
enough he killed his fucking mom what
the fuck did the kids do like what did
he just see the kids and just shot them
did he go into a class like they kick
him out the route they said he had
usually the autistic or he was severely
OD OCD where the fuck you call it
OCD whatever it is it better have an OCD
as fucking students do that I would get
a cure himself oh I did too
that's my that's my thing I think that's
the biggest problem with this is that he
had to fucking kill himself outdoors
where I would have liked the scene is
that fucking town in Connecticut
wrapping a fucking rope around the kids
neck and dragging him up that fucking
Street and the hanging has asked from a
tree and we fucking throw stones at his
fucking ass he won the lottery that's
what that's what that's what upsets me
cuz he's not gonna go to jail he's not
gonna you know he would have been raped
in jail he would have go to jail what do
you mean here to go to the Saints Allah
force well fuck bad then we need that's
what they all go
it's shit you know you kill a bunch of
kids and then you kill yourself
fuck it didn't dad has a different
belief than I do there's nothing there's
nothing afterlife to me so what the fuck
means nothing now and if there is
hopefully he's worm food
if nothing else if there is an afterlife
we can take solace in the fact that he's
getting fucking ass raped by Hitler
right now
and whatever you know rest in peace to
the kids I you know it's really it's a
tragedy it's a big tragedy people to
just die at such a young age not I get
to experience life getting ready for

myself cuz I can handle it
