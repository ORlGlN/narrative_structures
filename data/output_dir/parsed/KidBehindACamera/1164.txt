we just walk up to this cat
I think of one oh wow
you do really yeah let's get it you know
God your whole Felix hey Felix well here
we go to Pet Smart oh they're required
to make you carry him out in a little
little carrier because they can run
around the car and stuff so okay be is
she going home something through my ear
Felix's first steps into our home
so we're in the cat isn't the process of
getting to know the dogs right now you
doing pretty good job oh oh no bail so
he scared oh it's okay feelings collide
buddy be careful don't you get called
ladies behind me right now I think is
scared oh you're okay
he winks so Felix is two months
Oh
please be careful dogs I know you're
curing it you're gonna get a Herbert oh
hey
slow down I was just going to say this
is progress it definitely is it actually
really is so if you guys you not
understand what we're doing we're in the
process of getting Felix to understand
that it lives with these dogs and that
they all live together and for everybody
to stop being so aggressive with each
other so the best way to do that is to
let them in just introduce them and let
them play together but it's not like it
was that barkins will might mess it all
up close like so we meet again
lazy Oh eat my Val well this is it
you know I bought a tablet from Badcock
furnishings could they eat the old me of
good - it was good so I got the
insurance on it I think it was like 200
some bucks for the for two-year
unlimited in short you broke the broke
get you know did something get fixed
well metallic broke damn glass broke
that was five weeks ago so I end up
sending it back and they won't be the
fixture to replace it so the inside they
just gonna replace it
fine does door do PD insurance now movie
had it like eight weeks when they pick
it up today and I got no one there but
they will be pay pay for more insurance
a hundred and something dollars ain't
gonna do it
fuck it are they worth it it ain't worth
it
I'm telling you if you find even Badcock
furnishing do not buy from here because
they fuck you with the insurance that
you know you pay for - it also in the
breaks and use it they want to use they
wanted you know you'd pay more 130
thousand bucks so if you come in they're
nice people they really are but if you
buy anything do not buy here because you
will get fucked on the insurance well
