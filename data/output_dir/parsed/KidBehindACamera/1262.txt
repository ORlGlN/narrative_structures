puppet and why do I choose the puppet
because he's just a puppet
if it's just him then is there's no
puppetmaster which mean there's no
jigsaw meanwhile these other things are
monsters and demons and humans that want
to murder but this is just a puppet that
somebody made it's not evil I will
choose that Chris MVD tweeted a logo of
