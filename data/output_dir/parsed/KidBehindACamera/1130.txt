what's going on you guys keeping any
camera here and right now I am watching
this show called Bojack horseman it just
started on Netflix a friend of mine
named Tim sent it to me and I never
heard of it until tonight but earlier
tonight I started seeing people talk
about Oh Bojack horseman starts tonight
on Netflix and it is starring Aaron Paul
and Will Arnett and it's about a horse
it's a cartoon about a horse who was
once a famous actor in the 90s on a big
hit sitcom think Steve Urkel
you know Jaleel White I think it was his
name that guy you know he was real big
in the 90s and after that his career
sort of fizzled away so it's about a
washed-up actor horse that is still
living in his glory days and when I
first started watching it I was like I
don't know what I feel about this but I
can't stop watching it
and I need to stop watching it because
it is like going on six o'clock in the
morning and I'm only on Episode four and
