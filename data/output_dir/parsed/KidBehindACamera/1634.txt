so what you're about to see is clips
I guess just clips from something I shot
a couple of days ago maybe about a week
ago that I couldn't use because it had
music playing in the background which I
thought was fair use but apparently the
owners of the music said that I couldn't
use it I couldn't upload it with the
music so I have to splice it where the
music is gone the video was grandma on
the phone with somebody setting up her
new cell phone and she was talking to
them over the phone so she can set up
the phone and dad kept listening to
music and talking to the background so
she kept getting increasingly angrier
and had to go outside and anyway just
check this out at least as much of it as
I can edit into the video so check it
out
I can't even see the number
which number see ya
okay I've got the box
six eight
now for this scene right here I had to
remove the audio because anger grandpa's
actually playing Adele an angry grandma
I guess I would call her can't hear
while she's on the phone so she goes out
fuck it while she's on the phone and she
gets up and here we go we're going back
to audio right now
okay okay
I'm sorry that's my fucking I asshole
ex-husband making noise
but get Titleist drinking sighs sighs
I'm sorry I'm a little sorry that that's
why I'm dwarfs now he's gonna happen
yeah with all this shit going on sorry
all this shit
love pressure
