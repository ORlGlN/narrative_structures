hey guys KITT Bonnie camera or pickle
boy I just wanted to talk about a new
DVD about today or Bridget bought for me
because I'm a loser
UFC bad blood Chuck Liddell and Tito
Ortiz the DVD is about says what are you
doing shows after today what shouldn't
off your TV I don't want to show off the
TV why would I want to do that so I
finna it what just love it special
features are two bonus fights I have a
feeling I should have gotten the blu-ray
version of this because I got the HD TV
so the quality is not as good as it
could be on HDTV but it's still pretty
good and bridget is back behind me doing
the same thing as last time as a big fan
of UFC I gotta say that this DVD was
well worth the purchase I mean I am
really it's a good DVD for UFC fans for
non UFC fans is a good DVD to get you
into the UFC really go pick this up it's
pretty good I loved it
I'm gonna watch it again and I'm gonna
watch the DVD menu now what you got for
only watch something else
honestly I really recommend picking this
up but our UFC fan or not you're gonna
like it really excellent
and I can't understand what I'm saying
bad blood chuckle del tito ortiz
