it up Michael was go to the pool house
and look for the frickin Ouija board
that was burned on okay you would say on
the comments go look for the Ouija board
let's just go get it let's bury it and
let's forget it existed okay why why
can't you we need to take the sage burn
it over the hole when you place the
Ouija board in the ground you must have
kosher salt under it and on top of it
okay hold on and bury it let me get my
grocery list together so we can get the
Ouija well okay we need cinnamon pepper
you'll pay don't say that I feel like
that you will pay for it if you do not
do what I'm telling you we need poultry
seasoning stuffing Oh spiced chicken
broth I can't take it seriously oh sure
salt kosher
has to be kosher so why can it be
regular salt they won't work Michael
please don't do you want to stay in the
house but we have no intentions of
burying it right now there's no point
just I just what I don't want to I'm
scared
