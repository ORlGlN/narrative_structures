making the best salad ever you know you
could like just wave I want it cut now
but you're burning yourself just doing
this way Michael this is our salad guys
guys this is a meat and bacon salad okay
you guys I'm working on the best salad
ever yeah alright hands down best salad
ever now I got the recipe from the old
substation days we lived in Colombia
there was a salad called the bits and
pieces salad now the bits and piece of
salad would be all the extra pieces
and cheese and roast beef and whatever
meat fell off he would keep it in the
bag and then pop it in a salad
yeah so we're making a road this is
bacon ham turkey and two kinds of
cheeses provolone and smoked gouda yeah
let's just pour this right in oh yeah
oh my gosh what yes by the way there's
no diet today you guys because it's
Valentine's Day yeah Valentine's Day
guys okay it's so beautiful
I was wouldn't mix this together they
were supposed to be avocado in the salad
but they were rotten so nuova kado what
is this creamy Italian romano cheese
dressing
hmm okay here we go this is a
good-looking salad Bridget it is it
looks amazing decided yes beyond excited
actually this is just step one folks
this is just step one for dinner oh you
still got an entree and a dessert course
to go mmm
happy Valentine's Day Bridget oh thank
you baby you're the best the first step
in my spaghetti carbonara you guys is I
have chopped up bacon and I'm gonna cook
it until it's all crispy now the recipe
actually calls for prosciutto but we
don't like it we made it with prosciutto
one time and it had like a chemical
taste like it was very bizarre tasted
very strange so we stick to bake and now
remember bacon is very salty so don't
use any salt in this maybe plenty of
pepper maybe some pepper or whatever you
want to do no salt
it's salty enough okay I'm starting my
sauce right now you guys spaghetti
carbonara cooks really fast so egg
separately okay don't on that Oh Michael
it's okay I get all these rights
no I'm keeping it to stop
no next you want to make your spaghetti
carbonara sauce you guys egg oh I'm just
gonna do this
well you separate the egg what happened
here I don't know I think you did that
all right
hey was trying to trick huh just do it
the way I was yeah just do that I know
they're sick things Parmesan cheese
straight to your egg yolk miss mmm yes
sir there's something it's gonna be like
a really clumpy cheesy like yeah guys
this looks really gross but it's really
amazing yeah you're gonna have to have a
little trust here okay now then now that
we have added cheese I'm adding what no
other recipe calls for I do it a little
bit of milk straight to that that's a
little cream to it and there we go this
is gonna be our sauce and I know you're
thinking what yeah have a little faith
in me yeah look I think it looks great
disgusting just the way it's supposed to
try one of these noodles if they're
doing this I'll be careful
done cool aw these are L didn't tell you
guys which users still a bite to it now
we're taking it off the heat don't drain
them okay yeah don't join these noodles
guys you don't want to join him because
you wanted to sit there in a starch
house was gonna help thicken it
now we just finished up our bacon and
it's almost Showtime oh my god are you
excited that it's starting to get bacon
foam
look how greasy this is bro yeah I'm
getting your blood pressure pill
seriously yes and drink it all
no why I'm not about to drink 1.5 liters
of Fiji water how's it look president it
looks good enough to heart attack
yes Harnett okay no guys it is time it
is foamy the bacon is cooked oh my god
here we go this is where it's gonna get
really interesting really fast
yes alright ready yes
first you take the noodles with the
water still attached right here okay
let's just start mixing this all
together oh this is gonna be like I just
got freaking burn well you know what
I've been getting burns into started
alright now we're just gonna sit on top
of this pot that the water isn't there's
heat in there because the mess and final
step is our sauce this is tricky
this is tricky folks because if you
don't stop start at the right way the
bacon and noodles will boil or like
scramble the eggs ready yes I gotta be
quick there you go this is it guys
moment of truth okay
you doing great looks like it might be
some good carbonara girl

delish Titanic just ended as we
predicted and bridget is cry it's sad
it's very sad so I don't know like did
she die at the end
we're glutton for punishment yes
it's okay you know I went to see Titanic
at the theaters like nine times because
Kim was obsessed with it and this was
the same outcome every time with the
whole theater like there had to bend 40
girls on dates just crying their eyes
out and guys you should have died okay
we've hidden down the Titanic you'd be
dead by now
he really 125 we've had a life together
though well they have one afterwards he
was waiting for on the Titanic at the
end yeah okay come on
I remember when I went to see it so many
times I used to go up to the screen to
pretend I was sinking with the ship grow
up I was like seven or eight how do you
met for anymore the movie came out like
96 I was born in 87 I was nothing grow
up
feel better Oh destroy the happy
Valentine's Day that was like not having
any of this
Bella's like I would make room for him
on the door right
your wife Andrew stood back there was
room on that door for both of them there
was she was just like no I wouldn't take
the door it fries with you guys one time
we almost broke up because she was
asking me what I would do and I'm like
look I was look I'm a realist I answered
my answer questions realistically so she
said would you turn your life but around
and save me I that realistically I said
if I turned the lifeboat around they
would grab it like zombies and pull me
into the ocean and I would die that's
what what happened if I had to turn
around my life would again say you'd get
a boat it all about me think this is the
hypothetically
Deary I love you more I know it
Titanic it's gonna break us up sure I
would be on the door I would be on the
door with you I wouldn't even have to so
you wouldn't get in the boat without me
no you gave me the hypothetical you said
if you were on a boat and I was on the
door would you turn around you didn't
what you didn't like
I would not supposed to like I would
build the boat all you gave me a
hypothetical I answered it all right I
would turn the boat around I would save
you but everybody off this is just from
