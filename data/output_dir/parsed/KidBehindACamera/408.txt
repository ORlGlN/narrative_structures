we're leaving the fireworks stand and
okay full candor I filmed a scene on the
way to the fireworks stand that I
thought I would just be able to
seamlessly insert right after we let the
fireworks stand and pretend that it was
later even though we filmed it first I
do that sometimes
I'll put things in attic sequence
because uh I don't know I just like it
better there but I can't because Kim had
to sit there so because all the
fireworks go to the backseat yeah I had
to put up their armrest this is a time
where uh we're just kidding up we're not
really gonna do this we know that it's
not legal so we're gonna pull over in us
so yeah cover it yeah well hold on

earlier than I was going to present in
