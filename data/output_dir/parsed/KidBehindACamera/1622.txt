so I guess US airwaves isn't all that
bad I had a good time in DC went to the
White House this morning
you had a really nice free hotel room so
it wasn't that bad okay Bridget should
have been waiting for me here and she's
not so I think she's forgotten about me
so I'm pretty much fucked
wonder a chord when we met up again but
she's nowhere to be seen so I'm just
looking for Bridget actually where she
is she meet me at the airport so she's
left me so hi Bridget
what is she out there so she was against
getting on the airplane or the elevator
I guess she didn't forget about me after
huh well I'm home after days and days of
shit that was horrible it was it was
good in DC though I had a good time at
the wall at the White House and you know
that shit so pickle boys home and
somebody her muzzle in that crying baby
