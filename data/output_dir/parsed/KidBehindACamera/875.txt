I miss you guys so much and today is
Wednesday and today I'm home and today
i'm using a different camera and today
i'm pissed at you
the reason i'm using the other camera is
also the reason she's pissed at me
because she hid the other cameras
because last night i pranked Bridget
it's embarrassing goods understand right
if you saw them my if you didn't see my
vlog from last night take a look at this
I'm gonna wait till she falls asleep
breakin home invasion so Bridget had no
idea that I was coming home last night
I actually came home yesterday morning
around mid afternoon grandpa picked me
up from the airport and I was at dad's
house all day editing that vlog waiting
until Bridget was asleep oh shit did so
she's pissed off at me she's hitting the
cameras she won't give him to me I want
to know how she reacted who and we broke
the glass in front of the door
I broke glass in front of the door I
wonder how she reacted she won't tell me
you guys want to come in you miss me
oh of course they I think they missed
going inside more than me so let's go
and let you in usually the dogs like act
like they missed me when I get home but
they didn't seem to do with this time
I'm their favorite bell huh can ya can
you look at me or not
she don't care they don't care that I'm
home at all they were like I wish she
wouldn't be yeah they just did rather
take turns Reagan water them deal with
me so this is the camera I'm using I
think use this one in awhile so it's
actually kind of refreshing
hi I gotta use this for the vlog today
because birds won't give me the cameras
so ah hello good here I'm gonna talk for
a minute
well first things first update got the
cameras back I haven't watched the
videos yet but I got it back I got it
back I got it doc you need some bullshit
how he got those cameras back he was
fighting with me about Big Macs
sandwiches or chicken sandwiches and I
wanted chickens down to some like you
know what Robin booth oh yeah he really
does not give a shit about my birthday
so because it's your birthday I got to
eat what I don't want to eat I want to
burn this hair driver oh no you don't
want to do that my god yes I wanna show
the bishop so this is my latest shit I
blame you personally for that
I'm not for Glade plugin out - yeah just
do it for me okay here there we go
that's what it looks like this is my
SummerSlam chair and I love it
now Billy go a nice little collection of
chairs now what he said would make
bridges birthday dinner Oh Big Macs and
chicken sandwich with avocado please
okay so for Bridget's Big Mac birthday I
decided first we're going to make some
homemade Big Mac sauce starting up I
can't believe I'm gonna eat consume this
but the start of Big Mac sauce is half
of a cup of mayonnaise
so we don't have any frickin measuring
spoons so we're using this it calls for
two tablespoons of French dressing
hopefully that's accurate and enough or
I'm not pure mayonnaise ready okay four
of these with sweet relish in it one Oh
the same either hey yeah you know what
eat mine either so so one tablespoon of
minced onions so one teaspoon of white
vinegar a little bit of salt and then
the last ingredient one teaspoon of
sugar give it a stir well it certainly
looks like Big Mac so I know right you
can taste the minis I'm not gonna do
Dante's Mario's at all really seriously
dude
I lied I got you back yeah I'm sorry a
lactation bed action oh okay so I added
a little more French dressing for me and
it no longer tastes like mayonnaise it
tastes like Big Mac sauce so so for the
birds I'm going to be using a
combination of ground chuck and ground
sirloin I'm going to mix the two
together not much just enough the next
step is our bun which if you know a Big
Mac it has three bun so I took the top
in the bottom of a bun then I cut
another bunt in half so I can make the
middle bun oh and almost worth Thome it
may have to get a new bun okay
burger patty number one followed by a
burger patty number two very thin
they'll cook fast only salt and pepper a
little bit okay when I flip it I'm
looking for a crust on the meat just
like that
let's begin constructing while the
burger is almost done a little bit of
Big Mac sauce on the bottom bun followed
by a little bit of lettuce or as Damian
drops would call it crunchy water the
feedback only comes with one slice of
cheese but I order it with extra cheese
so that's what mine's going to have so
the first burger patty officially goes
down next up is our middle fun now then
on this middle button we are going to
add more Big Mac sauce a little more
crunchy water pickles
our next burger patty and our top bun
and there we have it a homemade Big Mac
where's my chicken sandwich I will do
those first
in a minute Bridget here we go can I
taste it mm-hmm
happy birthday yeah
thanks yeah it's good right
let me Baron chicken I knew it was this

McDonald's but it's still good
