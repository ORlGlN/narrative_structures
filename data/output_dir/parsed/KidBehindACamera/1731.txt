what's going on you guys kid behind a
camera here I know I promised you guys
the story about dad burning down the
porch for Thanksgiving
and I did record it tonight and now all
the grease all over the porch the flame
catches it fires everywhere all over our
front porch but my sister Kim is
underneath like an idiot she's
underneath the porch with a pot trying
to catch grease as it drips all over her
face and arms that's not why I'm here
today I want to wish Bridgette a Happy
Anniversary
11:16 there's now been three years she's
been stuck with me three fucking years
holy shit three years and I bought her a
new laptop for her birthday which she's
already got and actually gave it to her
early because her computer spazzed out
on her so I got her a new laptop for her
birthday so birthday her anniversary

today so let's look at that
I held onto bridges hand like a baby I
go grid to take my hand didn't hurt I
didn't feel anything but anyway happy
Anniversary to Bridget

with me and with angry grandpa that you
could take a loss of life time in this
family so
