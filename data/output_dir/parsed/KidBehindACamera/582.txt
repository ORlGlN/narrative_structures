today you guys thanks for watching her
get out of here I just wanted to do a
quick recap of what I did today and I'm
really sorry I didn't come more at
VidCon I would have liked to but you
know for one a lot of the day I was with
mcjuggernuggets and boogie and you know
at one point Vitaly and I didn't want to
like talking to them and then hey be on
my vlog I didn't I didn't want to do
that I don't want to be that I felt like
I would be infringing on the friendship
by asking them to be in my vlog so while
being with them
I didn't want to bother with that and of
course there was so many times I'll stop
for pictures and and I wish I would have
recorded more that I will really try
harder tomorrow it's the last day of
VidCon I'm really gonna try harder to
get more VidCon footage but today was
amazing you know I was searching for
mcjuggernuggets for a little bit and
then I found him and there was a whole
group of fans that wanted to meet him
and some of them cried as you saw ah it
was amazing and then I got a phone call
from boogie bully to 9ma and he told me
that there was this kid for the
make-a-wish Foundation and the kid
wanted to meet me
the kid that he asked to meet boogie and
while he was there he said that he
really wanted to last you to be wanted
me well it was there was me and of
course I walked right over there
instantly
of course you know it was the seance to
say it was humbling is not the right
word is it life-changing it's like
I get emotional thinking about it uh
somebody you don't know the make-a-wish
Foundation is they if somebody has like
a life-altering like elven like cancer
or just something like that they the
make-a-wish Foundation helps these
people you know they grant them a wish
and he told us the story and this is I'm
not gonna say the whole thing because it
was this kids story um he told us that
while he was getting treatments he would
watch us because he would sit there for
a while and he would watch our videos he
would watch me and boogie and other
youtubers and because of that he wanted
to meet us and he wanted to talk to us
because he felt like he knew us because
of the videos and that to me it puts so
much into perspective the little things
that aren't problems you know there are
people who face real shit and I don't
know I really appreciate boogie for you
know calling me and saying to come over
to the room and talking talking to him
and to the guy you know I don't want to
divulge his details but you know which
by the way he is in remission so good
for you man really really happy for you
and that was something that all remember
always so I'm gonna get out of here
thanks for watching you guys great first
day I hope to film more at VidCon
tomorrow but that's gonna be it for
today you guys like subscribe favorite
and that's it
you
