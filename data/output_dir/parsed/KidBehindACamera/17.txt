somewhere a lot of people been asking a
question lately in the comment section
and I haven't been responding to it and
I owe you guys a response and an
explanation are we leaving YouTube
are we leaving YouTube I don't know how
to say this
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
I realized I've been trying to do a lot
of stuff lately live streaming and I've
been talking about doing stand-up comedy
and writing movie scripts and I realized
that all of those kind of things have
been in my plans but that does not mean
that I plan on leaving YouTube no guys
YouTube gave me everything and if I have
two fans left or one fan left and that's
Bridgette I'm gonna be doing video okay
I'd probably quit if that were the case
I'd probably quit then if only have two
fans and ones mean ones you okay I'm
quitting but if I got four fans I'm
still quitting okay but as long as I got
you guys I'm not going anywhere now am i
planning on doing live streaming of
course and the reason that I'm planning
on doing live streaming is because we
love the game I never wanted to do it
before and I was talking to keemstar
and he was like why don't you livestream
video games and I was like I just don't
do that and he goes you game every night
and I was like you're right why aren't
we streaming this people could be
watching us play video games
at the same time my interest outside of
YouTube aren't necessary mutually
exclusive I like to do other things I
want to do stand-up comedy while I ever
do it
probably not but I've been writing jokes
I want to write a movie and I want to
sell it am I ever going to I don't know
but that's the dream but if those things
happen it doesn't mean that I'm leaving
YouTube if I do stand-up comedy I'm
gonna take the camera with me and I'm
gonna film when are you bashed in the
face with a beer bottle come on that's
good vlog that's viral if I go and I
sell a movie script I'm gonna be filming
on the set of a movie until Sony
Pictures Sue's me over ten years ago I
set out to live the dream with my father
and that dream was entertaining people
and making people happy and putting on a
show that people enjoy to watch and boy
do we succeed in doing that boy did we
make people happy boy did we change
people's lives and I don't know how we
did it but people write me every day
saying how we help them and we inspire
them and I'm not gonna give that up for
anything you guys this is the greatest
thing that I've ever done in my life and
I'm not leaving it as long as you guys
are there with us so am i leaving
youtube of course not dad wanted me to
continue living this dream and I want to
continue living it for him guys
we're not going anywhere we're just
gonna be doing more stuff on YouTube I'm
not going to twitch we do on YouTube
gaming although I might do twitch I
don't know okay guys so though Michael
isn't leaving YouTube eyes sadly have to
say that I'm not either okay she just
clicked painted the whole vlog
she just clicked made it a scene
Bridgette we really had to stop covering
this lens seriously I need a new
transition because all I do is cover the
lens guys let's do this outro well
that's gonna be it for today you guys

day you pranked me I did but you know it
was a very nice prank no pranks are nice
pranks but look you got me that's a
llama you got me okay everybody is very
excited I know I'm really happy for you
third row at WrestleMania that's awesome
guys we're getting out of here I hope to
answer some of your questions whether
we're leaving YouTube or whether we're
moving going to other things guys I
could never leave YouTube not after
everything that we've done on a youtube
might screw up a lot of times when it
comes to views and notifications and all
that but I'd never turned my back on it
