camera here and it is Monday House

did not put a vlog up last night for
Sunday and if you're wondering why the
reason I did not upload a video and I
had people asking me which is why I'm
going to the neck splen a ssin the
reason I did not upload a video for last
night is because the day before I had
uploaded the video was Sadie with super
Sadie and grandpa and I thought it might
seem a little disrespectful if I go from
you know grandpa's you know day with
with Sadie to the next day me being oh
