what's going on you guys kid be on a
camera here so do I see ya right there
and today Michael is wearing a new shirt
I think it quietly right now so good
dude I can shower you sounds really good
Bridgette looks sounds and smells like
shit but oh yeah you do look like shit
right now I'm pretty tired guys guys
it is six o'clock in the morning right
now and poor Bridget so I could get up
in time stayed up all frickin night I
did
oh poor through guru right now I am on
my way to Columbia with Grandpa and JC
because like I didn't wanna have to talk
about it so last month on Twitter okay
so I like to try to keep some of the
private stuff as private as I can't
write like JC's education for one you
know it he's a he's underage
he doesn't need like his education like
brought up on a youtube channel but last
month when Grandpa and I and JC went up
to Columbia for the Auto Show thing and
I forgot all the paperwork I posted on
Twitter that we were also there to look
at an opportunity school for JC I've
made a huge mistake talking about it and
now people are talking about it so now I
have no choice but to mention it but I
did not want to bring up an underage
kids freakin education on YouTube but I
have to now so to explain what's
happening JC is about a good opportunity
school for the next three months because
he's having a really hard time in school
and it's it sucks because we don't want
to see him go but it's only for three
months and what it really is is the more
hands-on learning experience for him to
like he's going to have somebody beside
him all day teaching him well you all
right
she's sad about it do it let me let her
out come on out girl
you're free someone are you sure oh no
one is sheriff fella it's all you girl
I guess you early through the crying
you're right it is so anyway he's going
to be getting a more hands-on education
for the next three months the point is
so he'll excel at life because right now
he's doing bad in school he has learning
disability is that a heel he has ADHD
and his school doesn't really know how
to handle him and his education so today
we're sending him to an opportunity
school for the next three month so he
can excel it like he'll be back before
summer begins and they'll be coming home
on the weekends and stuff but it's I
hate to see him go it's a great
opportunity but it's a really good
opportunity for him and he's going to be
learning a lot so today we're going to
Columbia and Jason go in opportunity
school well Mickey J I really will miss
him definitely
he's been really like really good lately
and he's really excited to go so J I'm
