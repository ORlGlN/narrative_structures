peeps not really that belongs to
somebody else so anyway just had my just
had my first shake of the day so another
couple days I'm gonna be weighing in one
video as promised you know the first few
days are the hardest and we got through
that hustle that hustle that hurdle the
first three days were the worst it's
still such so you say they look bad
no I'm oh yeah I look so then I can tell
like your face hate me like one of your
french models no I don't look then
you're basically dinner you've lost some
weight I know what do you think eyes I'm
going to guess by Wednesday you have
lost fifteen eighteen pounds fifteen and
you'll really speak out your ass I'll
say eight pounds fifteen Jesus you
started there now you're gone Oh money
season don't try to give me twenty
pounds in a week
hey it happens today when we walk bridge
and I are gonna use the sink walk it's
all day activity tracker upload progress
to your smartphone so gonna find out how
many calories are burned while I'm
walking okay so the way it works is I
clip it on I wear it I walk with it then
I check my calories afterwards and I
plug it into my phone so I can sync it
to my account it will keep track of the
weight of the calories that I've lost
while using their product currently have
it attached right there
so we'll find out so we've been walking
for a few now it's hot
even the next Bell round let me see
yours
so there's Bridget's 144 steps so far so
hope mine is still here
what does mine say 168 have we taken the
same decided long before noon well just
got back from the first walk Bridget was
walking with weights five pound weights
and they were hard huh say that was 1550
steps and seventy calories so seventy
three point five calories so anyway
probably a little more with those
weights anyway that's the first one I
realize it ain't much but it's a process
so looking forward to Wednesday weigh in
