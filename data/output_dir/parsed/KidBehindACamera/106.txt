comment as Doug sang the most hateful
crap that I've ever seen decibels read
it real quick it says I tell him all the
time to clean up his diet and drink
water and exercise and I told him you'll
see improvements in your life but it
keeps eating crap and no exercise if

question have you noticed that her
Christmas tree only has half a strand of
lights on them yeah yeah Jennifer is on
the verge of trying to prank me and I
don't know exactly what the prank is I
think she's trying to get me to make fun
of her tree or something so she could be
like oh I'm sad oh why because she's a
prick I don't know I don't have the
reason for it but here's what I'm not
gonna do him pranks here's why I know
it's a prank okay okay first for three
days that were going over to the house
and I've noticed that there's no lights
on the tree there's no decorations and
she's been trying to point it out what
do you think about my chain and she's
been trying to get me to say something
now well we were cleaning grandpa's
house the other day I went into her
closet and I found a whole bunch of
Christmas tree decorations
what are you doing Jenny she's trying to
get us to make fun of it

is when you're prank idea for me is to
just get me to make fun of your tree
like okay I'll make fun of it no problem
