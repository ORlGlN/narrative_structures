the mistake of letting people grab their
own candy I just wanted you know people

cool house I did that trailer on the
corner is awesome well you know what
they took all our candy we had about six
trick-or-treaters and about $50 in candy
was gone there was more than sex we
started serving as like ten we started
serving candy serving candy soup so on
everybody line starts behind them
we started handing out candy about I
think it was about 7:30 and by 8 o'clock
we were at a candy we were going inside
and turning the lights off because we
had nothing left to give look at this
his poor little basket and they got
empty like a stop just I guess he should
have been the one to head out shut up
nobody was gonna come to me Michael
every time somebody saw me in this mask
they walked away so what
it's really called so happy happy
