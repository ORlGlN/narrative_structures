you knows a Palmetto bug in the car well
this is what kind of car Ronnie
oh god it's God keep the hours we give
it everything against it
what's goin on you guys hid behind a
horrible gotiya is that even considered
a goatee this looks awful
Bridget west not here she's asleep you
want to see the reason this vlog is
starting off while Bridget's asleep is
because today is the day grandpa can't
get out of it anymore even if I go wake
her up guys
grandpa is going to taco bell for
breakfast you know it's getting close to
11:00 and he's not here it's about nine
o'clock in the morning right now you
guys the birds are chirping if you can't
tell they're beautifully having a good
day I'm not Grandpa's not here yet he
promised he would there's a spider
web-like is it forming let me now
yesterday he had a doctor's appointment
okay that I understand you had to miss
talk about because you had a doctor's
appointment there's no excuse today well
got to do what I got to do grandpa dad
I'm waking Bridget up we're going to
your house and we're going to Taco Bell
you leave me no choice
my apologies I really wanted to wear my
Mario shirt to talk about you guys I
really like that shirt number one people
always talk about it they come up to me
hey you do know that he's dying right
there right and I'm like yeah I do cuz
like 30 people told me today I wanted to
wear my Mario shirt and now I gotta find
it cuz this is what our clothes pile
looks like weed this is a dude this
looks like a frickin trash Mountain this
is how I find clothes in the morning
ever wonder why I'm wearing the same
shirt like 35 days in a row
that's why clothes Mountain so if I want
to find clothes oh you like okay go on
or this shirt no don't these boxers know
eventually all the clothes will be like
right here and Bridget freaks out on me
so then I'll say forget clothes Mountain
let me come to the bathroom
wait a minute all right bathrooms clean
I'm at I knew you those clothes in the
fire I really don't feel like digging
through clothes Mountain
now maybe when Bridget wakes up I'll see
if she can help me but if not I got
another solution wrestle crate
there's always shirts and wrestle crate
what do we got okay is the shirt for the
Godfather do I want to wear a pimpin
ain't easy shirt probably not probably
not a pimpin ain't easy shirt oh do I
want to wear our Brutus the barber
beefcake now I could wear a shirt with a
barber on it but I'm gonna gonna draw
attention to the fact that I got hair
sticking out of my ears in the back of
my head and this yeah I'm not gonna wear
a barber sure not gonna wear one of the
shirts from the wrestle correct by the
way you guys one of the things that a
lot of people have been pointing out to
me on the videos is like this I got this
big strand of hair sticking out and then
there's like all kinds of patches look I
would love to shave my hair I would love
to shave this but I'm not allowed to
because everybody clicked like so I
wouldn't so I have to like abide by that
