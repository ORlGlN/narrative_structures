for dinner okay what do you want her
here come on dude and hotdog you because
I almost forgot to tell you guys the
good news so right now angry grandpa is
on his way to my house and the reason
that grandpa is on his way to my house
is because I got a huge surprise
yesterday we were sitting at the table
yesterday and dad made a mention Mike I
want to go my book Krrish one of the
things in my book here this is your
million subscribers on grand prize
corner and we weren't recording at the
time so I was like Bridget you know for
court days and I asked them we need to
repeat it one of the top items on his
bucket list is to get 1 million
subscribers on grandpa's corner and the
reason is because you want one of those
for his house now I told you need to
have every freaking play button we have
he can have this one he can have that
one but for some reason he doesn't feel
emotionally of those it's awesome
he doesn't feel emotionally connected to
those buttons like he does start his own
channel because that's grandpas : her
now obviously he's emotionally connected
to these but for some reason he thinks
they belong to me and they don't dad if
you see this you can take those any time
you want but he has a little bit of a
bucket list and on that bucket list is
to hit a million subscribers so I told
you guys if you want to make grandpa
happy subscribe help him reach a million
send it to your friends send it to
anybody that you think of help and you
guys answered the call now he did not
hit a million subscribers
obviously overnight you know we're not
pewdiepie right but he did get over
25,000 new subscribers in one day that's
gonna blow his frickin mind he's on his
way right now dad you got a bunch of new
subscribers dude you're fucking
