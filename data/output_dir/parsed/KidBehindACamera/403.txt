what's going on you guys kid behind a
camera here
Brigitte West not here and the reason
Brigitte West is not here my hat looks
maybe hat my head look like it was like
blowing up anyway the reason
Bridget's not here is because she took
Bella to Petsmart to I think she has to
get some sort of evaluation before
tomorrow because tomorrow Bella has to
go in for surgery tomorrow Bella gets
the mast cell tumor and her face removed
and it's scary you guys it's this one is
worse than one she had in her Paul so
we're not sure what's gonna happen but
that's tomorrow I don't want to sour
this vlog right now we don't going to
worry about that until tomorrow
today is Tuesday and you're seeing this
on Wednesday so by the time you've seen
this bail is actually going to be going
in for the surgery but okay I said it
